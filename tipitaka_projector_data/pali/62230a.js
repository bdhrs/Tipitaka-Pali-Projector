P_HTM[6]="***“Whatever jewels there may be.” This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Sāvatthi, about some laymen who kept the Uposatha precepts. On the Uposatha, it is said, they rose early in the morning, took upon them the Uposatha precepts, gave alms, and after their meal took perfumes and garlands in their hands and went to Jetavana, and at the time of hearing the Dhamma seated themselves on one side. The Teacher, coming to the Dhamma Hall, having sat down in the adorned Buddha-seat, looked upon the assembly of the monks. Now the Tathāgatas like to converse with those among the monks or others, in reference to whom a Dhamma discourse takes its rise; therefore on the present occasion, as he knew that a Dhamma discourse concerning former teachers would arise in connection with these laymen, while he was conversing with them, he asked them, “O laymen, do you keep the Uposatha?” On their replying in the affirmative, he said: “It is right and well done of you, O laymen; but yet it is no matter for wonder that you who have a Buddha like me for teacher should keep the Uposatha, sages of old who were without any teacher forsook great glory and kept the Uposatha.” And so saying, he told at their request a story of the past.*";
P_HTM[7]="***The City*";
P_HTM[8]="***In the past, Brahmadatta, when he was reigning in Benares, had made his son viceroy; but when he saw his great glory, he became suspicious lest he should also seize the kingdom. So he said to him, “Do you depart hence and dwell for the present where you please, and at my death take the hereditary kingdom.” The prince complied, and after saluting his father, went out and proceeding to the Yamunā built a hut of leaves between the river and the sea and dwelt there, living on roots and fruits.*";
P_HTM[9]="***Now at that time a young Nāga female in the Nāga world beneath the ocean who had lost her husband, and on account of her carnal passions, when she saw the happiness of the other Nāgas who had husbands living she had left the Nāga world, was wandering by the seashore, when she observed the prince’s footprints, and following the track saw the hut of leaves. Now the prince happened to be away, having gone out in search of various kinds of fruit. She entered into the hut, and as she saw the wooden bedstead and the rest of the furniture she thought to herself, “This is the dwelling-place of some ascetic, I will prove him, whether he is an ascetic from faith or not. If he is an ascetic from faith and bent upon self-abnegation he will not accept my adorned bed; but if he is at heart a lover of pleasure and not an ascetic from faith he will lie down on my bed; then I will take him and make him my husband and dwell here.”*";
P_HTM[10]="***So she went back to the Nāga world and collected divine flowers and perfumes and prepared a bed of flowers, and having made an offering of flowers and scattered perfumed powder about and adorned the hut, she departed to the abode of the Nāgas. When the prince returned at evening time and entered the hut, and saw what she had done, he said: “Who has prepared this bed?” And when he ate the various fruits, he exclaimed, “Oh these sweet-scented flowers, this bed has been pleasantly arranged,” and being filled with pleasure as he was not a true ascetic at heart, he lay down on the couch of flowers and fell fast asleep.*";
P_HTM[11]="***The next day he rose at sunrise and went off to collect fruits, without sweeping his hut of leaves. At that moment the female Nāga came up and seeing the withered flowers knew at once, “This man is a lover of pleasure and not an ascetic from faith, I shall be able to capture him,” so she took away the old flowers and brought others and spread a fresh bed and adorned the hut of leaves and strewed flowers etc. in the covered walk and then returned to the Nāga world.*";
P_HTM[12]="***He rested that night also on that bed of flowers and the next day he thought to himself, “Who can it be that adorns this hut?” So he did not go out to gather fruits, but remained concealed not far from the hut. The Nāga woman, having collected perfumes and flowers, came along the path to the hermitage. The prince, having beheld the Nāga in all her great beauty, at once fell in love with her, and, without letting himself be seen, entered the hut as she was preparing the couch and asked her who she was. “My lord, I am a Nāga woman.” “Have you a husband or not?” “I am a widow without a husband; and where do you dwell?” “I am prince Brahmadatta, the son of the king of Benares; but why do you wander about, leaving the abode of the Nāgas?” “My lord, as I beheld the happiness of the other Nāga women who had husbands I became discontented on account of carnal passion and I came away and go wandering about, seeking for a husband.” “I also am not an ascetic from faith, but I have come to dwell here because my father drove me away; vex not thyself, I will be your husband and we will dwell here in concord.” She at once consented; and from that time they lived harmoniously together there.*";
P_HTM[13]="***By her magic power she made a costly house and brought a costly couch and spread a bed. Thenceforth he ate no roots or fruits but feasted on divine meat and drink. After a while she conceived and brought forth a son whom they called Sāgara Brahmadatta. When the child was able to walk, she brought forth a daughter, and as she was born on the seashore they called her Samuddajā.*";
P_HTM[14]="***Now a forester who lived in Benares came to that place, and on giving him greeting recognised the prince, and after he had stayed there a few days, he said: “My lord, I will tell the king’s family that you are dwelling here,” and he accordingly departed and went to the city. Now just then the king died, and after the ministers had buried him they met together on the seventh day, and they deliberated together, “a kingdom without a king cannot stand; we know not where the prince dwells nor whether he is alive or dead, we will send forth the festal carriage and so get a king.”*";
P_HTM[15]="***At that time the forester came to the city, and having heard the news went to the ministers and told them that before he came there he had been staying three or four days near the prince. The ministers paid him respect and went there under his guidance, and after a friendly greeting told the prince that the king was dead and asked him to assume the kingdom. He thought to himself, “I will learn what the Nāgini thinks,” so he went to her and said: “Lady, my father is dead and his ministers have come to raise the royal umbrella over me; let us go and we will both reign in Benares which is twelve yojanas in extent, and you shall be the chief among the sixteen thousand queens.” “My lord, I cannot go.” “Why?” “We possess deadly poison and we are easily displeased for a trifling matter; and the anger of a co-wife is a serious thing; if I see or hear anything and cast an angry glance thereon, it will be instantly scattered like a handful of chaff; therefore I cannot go.”*";
P_HTM[16]="***The prince asked her again the next day; and then she said to him, “I myself will on no account go, but these my sons are not young Nāgas; as they are your children they are of the race of men; if you love me watch over them. But as they are of a watery nature and therefore delicate, they would die if they went by the road and bore the burden of the wind and sunshine; so I will hollow out a boat and fill it with water, and you shall let them play in the water and when you have brought them to the city you shall have a lake prepared in the precincts of the palace; in this way they will not suffer.” With these words, having saluted the prince and walked round him respectfully, she embraced her sons and folded them between her breasts and kissed their heads, and entrusted them to him, and with many tears and sobs at once vanished and departed to the Nāga world.*";
P_HTM[17]="***The prince also, overcome with sorrow, his eyes filled with tears, went out of the house, and, after wiping his eyes, proceeded to the ministers, who at once besprinkled him and said: “Sire, let us go to our city.” He commanded them to hollow out a ship and put it on a cart and fill it with water. “Strew all sorts of flowers of various colours and scents on the surface of the water, for my sons have a watery nature and they will go along joyfully playing there,” and the ministers did so.*";
P_HTM[18]="***When the king came to Benares he entered the city which was all adorned, and he seated himself on the terrace, surrounded by sixteen thousand dancing girls and his ministers and other officers; and having held a great drinking feast for seven days, he caused a lake to be prepared for his sons, where they sported continually. But one day when the water was let into the lake, a turtle entered, and not seeing any way of exit it floated on the surface of the water; and while the lads were playing about, it rose out of the water and putting out its head looked at them and then sank down in the water. When they saw it they were frightened and ran to their father, and said to him, “O father, a Yakkha has frightened us in the lake.” The king ordered some men to go and seize it, and they threw a net and caught the turtle and showed it to the king. When the princes saw it, they cried out, “O father, it is a Yakkha.” The king through love of his sons was angry with the turtle, and ordered the attendants to punish it. Some said: “It is an enemy to the king, it should be pounded to powder with a pestle and mortar,” others said: “Let us cook it three times over and eat it,” others: “Bake it upon hot coals,” others: “It must be baked in a jar,” but one minister who was afraid of the water, said: “It should be thrown into the whirlpool of the Yamunā, it will be utterly destroyed there, there is no punishment for it like that.”*";
P_HTM[19]="***The turtle, as he heard his words, thrust out his head and said: “Friend, what wrong have I committed that you are discussing such a punishment for me? The other punishments I can bear, but this last is excessively cruel, do not even mention it.” When the king heard him, he said: “This is the one to carry into action,” so he ordered him to be thrown into the whirlpool of the Yamunā; there he found a current which led to the dwelling of the Nāgas, and went by it to their place.*";
P_HTM[20]="***Now at that time some young sons of the Nāga king Dhataraṭṭha were sporting in that stream, and when they saw they cried, “Seize that slave.” The turtle thought: “I have escaped from the hand of the king of Benares to fall into the hands of these fierce Nāgas; by what means shall I get away?” Then he thought of a plan, and, making up a false story, he said to them, “Why do you speak in this way who belong to the court of king Dhataraṭṭha? I am a turtle named Cittaculla, and I am come to Dhataraṭṭha as a messenger from the king of Benares; our king has sent me as he wishes to give his daughter to king Dhataraṭṭha, show me to him,” and they were well pleased and took him, and going to the king related the whole matter.*";
P_HTM[21]="***The king ordered them to bring him; but being displeased when he saw him, he said: “Those who have such mean bodies cannot act as messengers.” The turtle, when he heard this, replied by telling his own good qualities, “Why should the king need messengers as tall as a palm tree? A small body or a big body is of no matter, the real matter is the power to carry out the errand where you are sent. Now our king, O monarch, has many messengers; men do his business on the dry land, birds in the air, and I in the water, for I am a favourite of the king’s named Cittaculla and I have a particular post, do not scoff at me.” Then king Dhataraṭṭha asked him why he was sent by the king, and he made answer, “The king said to me that he had made friendship with all the kings of Jambudīpa, and that he now wished to give his daughter Samuddajā in order to make friendship with the Nāga king Dhataraṭṭha; with these words he sent me, and do you make no delay but send a company at once with me and name the day and receive the maiden.” Being highly pleased the king paid him great honour and sent four Nāga youths with him, bidding them go and fix a day after hearing the king’s words, and then return, and they, having taken the turtle with them, departed from the abode of the Nāgas.*";
P_HTM[22]="***The turtle saw a lotus-pond between the Yamunā and Benares, and wishing to escape by some device he said: “O Nāga youths, our king and his queen and son saw me coming out of the water as I went to the king’s palace, and they asked me to give them some lotuses and lotus roots; I will gather some for them; do you let me go here, and, if you do not see me, go forward to the king, I will meet you there.” They believed him and let him go, and he hid himself; and the others, as they could not see him, thought that he must have gone on to the king, and so proceeded to the palace in the guise of young men. The king received them with honour and asked them from whence they had come. “From Dhataraṭṭha, your majesty.” “Wherefore?” “O king, we are his messengers; Dhataraṭṭha asks after your health and he will give you whatever you desire; and he asks you to give us your daughter Samuddajā as his queen.” To explain this they repeated the first verse:*";
P_HTM[23]="***1. “Whatever jewels there may be in Dhataraṭṭha’s palace stored,*";
P_HTM[24]="***They all are yours, his royal boon; give us your daughter for our lord.”*";
P_HTM[25]="***When the king heard it he replied in the second verse:*";
P_HTM[26]="***2. “Ne’er has a man been known to wed his daughter to a Nāga king;*";
P_HTM[27]="***Such match were utterly unfit, how could we think of such a thing?”*";
P_HTM[28]="***The youths made answer, “If an alliance with Dhataraṭṭha seems so improper to you, then why did you send your attendant the turtle Cittaculla to our king, offering to give your daughter Samuddajā? Since after sending such a message you now show scorn to our king, we shall know how to deal with you as you deserve.” So saying they uttered two verses by way of threat:*";
P_HTM[29]="***3. “You sacrifice your life, O king, your throne and kingdom what are they?*";
P_HTM[30]="***Before a Nāga in his wrath all mortal glory fades away;*";
P_HTM[31]="***4. You a poor mortal standing there, who, by your vanity undone,*";
P_HTM[32]="***Would look with scorn on Yamuna, king Varuṇa’s imperial son.”*";
P_HTM[33]="***Then the king repeated two verses:*";
P_HTM[34]="***5. “I do not scorn that king of yours, Dhataraṭṭha of wide renown,*";
P_HTM[35]="***Of many Nāgas is he king, he wears by right a royal crown;*";
P_HTM[36]="***6. But great and noble though he be, sprung from Videha’s khattiya line,*";
P_HTM[37]="***My daughter is of purer blood, let him not dream of child of mine.”*";
P_HTM[38]="***Although the Nāga youths wished to kill him on the spot by the blast of their breath, yet they reflected that as they had been sent to fix the marriage day it would not be right to go away and leave the man dead; so they vanished at once out of sight, saying: “We will depart and tell the king.”*";
P_HTM[39]="***Their king asked them whether they had brought the princess. They being angry replied, “O king, why do you send us about here and there without cause? If you wish to kill us, then slay us here at once. He reviles and defames you, and sets his daughter on a pinnacle in his pride of birth,” in this way repeating things said and unsaid, they roused the king’s wrath. He ordered them to assemble his army, saying:*";
P_HTM[40]="***7. “Assataras and Kambalas, summon the Nāgas one and all;*";
P_HTM[41]="***Towards Benares let them flock, but do no harm to great or small.”*";
P_HTM[42]="***Then the Nāgas answered, “If no man is to be harmed, then what shall we do, if we go there?” He uttered two verses to tell them what they were to do and what he himself would do:*";
P_HTM[43]="***8. “Over the tanks and palaces, the public roads and tops of trees,*";
P_HTM[44]="***Over the gateways woven in wreaths let them hang dangling in the breeze;*";
P_HTM[45]="***9. While with white body and white hoods I will the city all invest,*";
P_HTM[46]="***And drawing close my lines of siege with terror fill each Kāsi breast.”*";
P_HTM[47]="***The Nāgas did so.*";
P_HTM[48]="***The Teacher thus described what happened:*";
P_HTM[49]="***10-11. “Seeing the snakes on every side, the women throng, a trembling crowd,*";
P_HTM[50]="***And as the monsters swell their hoods in fear they shriek and wail aloud;*";
P_HTM[51]="***12-13. Benares city prostrate lay before these wild invading bands,*";
P_HTM[52]="***Raising their arms all begged and prayed: ‘Give him the daughter he demands.’ ”*";
P_HTM[53]="***While the king lay in bed he heard the wailing of his own wives and those of the citizens, and being afraid of death from the threats of the four youths, he thrice exclaimed, “I will give to Dhataraṭṭha my daughter Samuddajā,” and all the Nāga kings, when they heard it, retired for the distance of a league, and, fixing their camp there, built a very city of the gods and dispatched a complimentary present, saying: “Let him send his daughter as he says.” The king, having received the proffered present, dismissed those who brought it, saying: “Do you depart, I will send my daughter by the hands of my ministers.” Then he sent for his daughter and, taking her upon the terrace, he opened a window and said to her, “Daughter, behold this adorned city; they say that you are to be the chief queen of a king there, the city is not far off, you can come back when you feel a home-longing, but you must go there now.”*";
P_HTM[54]="***Then he made the attendants wash her head and adorn her with all kinds of ornaments and set her in a covered carriage and sent her off in the care of his ministers. The Nāga kings came to meet her and paid her great honour. The ministers entered the city and gave her up and returned with much wealth. The princess was taken up into the palace and made to lie on a divinely decked bed; and the young Nāga women, assuming humpbacked and other deformed appearances, waited on her as if they were human attendants. As soon as she lay down on the heavenly bed she felt a divinely soft touch and fell asleep.*";
P_HTM[55]="***Dhataraṭṭha, having received her, vanished instantly with all his host and appeared in the world of the Nāgas. When the princess awoke and saw the adorned heavenly bed and the golden and jewelled palaces, etc., and the gardens and tanks and the Nāga world, itself like an adorned city of the gods, she asked the humpbacked and other female attendants, “This city is magnificently adorned, it is not like our city; whose is it?” “O lady, it belongs to your lord, it is not those of scanty merits who win such glory as this, you have obtained it by reason of your great merits.” Then Dhataraṭṭha ordered the drums to be carried about the Nāga city, which was five hundred yojanas in extent, with a proclamation that whoever betrayed any signs of his snake-nature to Samuddajā should be punished; therefore not one dared to appear as a snake before her. So she lived affectionately and harmoniously with him under the idea that it was a world of men.*";
P_HTM[56]="***The Fast-Day*";
P_HTM[57]="***In course of time Dhataraṭṭha’s queen conceived and brought forth a son, and from his fair appearance they named him Sudassana; then again she bore a second whom they called Datta, – now he was the Bodhisatta. Then she bore another whom they called Subhaga, and a fourth whom they called Ariṭṭha. Yet even though she had borne these four sons, she knew not that it was the world of the Nāgas. But one day they said to Ariṭṭha, “Your mother is a woman, not a Nāga.” Ariṭṭha said to himself, “I will prove her,” so one day while drinking from his mother’s breast, he assumed a serpent’s form and struck the back of her foot with his tail. When she saw his serpent-form she uttered a great cry in her terror and threw him on the ground, and struck his eye with her nail so that the blood poured forth. The king, hearing her cry, asked why she screamed, and when he learned what Ariṭṭha had done, he came up, with threats, “Seize the slave and put him to death.” The princess, knowing his passionate nature, exclaimed in her love for her son, “My lord, I struck my son’s eye, forgive him.” The king, when she said this, replied, “What can I do?” and forgave him. That very day she learned that it was the dwelling of the Nāgas, and thenceforth Ariṭṭha was always called Kāṇāriṭṭha (or one-eyed Ariṭṭha).*";
P_HTM[58]="***Now the four princes grew up to years of discretion. Then their father gave them each a kingdom a hundred yojanas square; they possessed great glory, and each was attended by sixteen thousand Nāga maidens. Now their father’s kingdom was only a hundred yojanas square, and the three sons went every month to visit their parents. But the Bodhisatta went every fortnight, and he used to propound some question which had arisen in the Nāga realm and then go with his father to visit the great king Virūpakkha, and he would discuss the question with him. Now one day when Virūpakkha had gone with the Nāga assembly to the world of the gods, and were sitting there waiting upon Sakka, a question arose among the gods and none could answer it, but the Great Being who was seated on a noble throne answered it. Then the King of the Devas honoured him with divine flowers and fruits, and addressed him, “O Datta, you are endued with a wisdom as broad as the earth; henceforth be you called Bhūridatta,” and he gave him this name.*";
P_HTM[59]="***From that time forth he used to go to pay his homage to Sakka, and when he saw the exceedingly delightful splendour of his court with its Devaccharā he longed for the heavenly world, “What have I to do with this frog-eating snake-nature? I will return to the snake-world and keep the fast and follow the observances by which one may be reborn among the gods.” With these thoughts he asked his parents on his return to the abode of the snakes, “O my father and mother, I will keep the fast.” “By all means, O son, keep it; but when you keep it do not go outside, but keep it within this one empty palace in the Nāga realm, for there is great fear of the Nāgas outside.” He consented; so he kept the fast only in the parks and gardens of the empty palace.*";
P_HTM[60]="***But the snake maidens kept waiting on him with their musical instruments, and he thought to himself, “If I dwell here my observance of the fast will never come to its completion, I will go to the haunts of men and keep the fast there.” So in his fear of being hindered he said to his wife, without telling it to his parents, “Lady, if I go to the haunts of men there is a banyan tree on the bank of the Yamunā, I will fold up my body in the top of an ant-hill near by and undertake the fast with its four divisions, and I will lie down there and observe the fast; and when I have lain there all night and kept the fast let ten of your women come every time at dawn with musical instruments in their hands, and after decking me with perfumes and flowers let them conduct me back with song and dance to the abode of the Nāgas.” With these words he went and folded his body on the top of an ant-hill, and saying aloud, “Let who will take my skin or muscles or bones or blood,” he undertook the fast with its four divisions and lay down, after assuming a body which only consisted of a head and a tail, and kept the fast. At daybreak the Nāgīs came, and having done as they were ordered, conducted him to the Nāga abode; and while he observed the fast in this fashion, a long period of time elapsed.*";
P_HTM[61]="***Entering the Forest*";
P_HTM[62]="***Now at that time a brahmin who dwelt in a village near the gate of Benares used to go into the forest with his son Somadatta and set snares and nets and stakes and kill wild animals, and carrying the flesh on a pole sold it and so made a livelihood. One day he failed to catch even a young lizard, and he said to his son, “If we go home empty-handed your mother will be angry, let us catch something at any rate,” so he went towards the ant-hill where the Bodhisatta was lying, and observing the footsteps of the deer who went down to the Yamunā to drink, he said: “My son, this is a haunt of deer, do you return and wait, while I will wound some deer that has come to drink,” so taking his bow he stood watching for deer at the foot of a tree. Now at evening time a deer came to drink, he wounded it; it did not however fall at once, but spurred on by the force of the arrow it fled with the blood flowing down, and the father and son pursuing it to the spot where it fell took its flesh and, going out of the wood, reached that banyan as the sun set. “It is a bad time, we cannot go on, we will stay here,” so saying they laid the flesh on one side and climbing the tree lay among the branches. The brahmin woke at dawn, and was listening to hear the sound of the deer, when the Nāga maidens came up and prepared the flowery couch for the Bodhisatta. He laid aside his snake’s body and assuming a divine body adorned with all kinds of ornaments sat on his flower-bed with all the glory of a Sakka.*";
P_HTM[63]="***The Nāga maidens honoured him with perfumes and garlands and played their heavenly instruments and performed their dance and song. When the brahmin heard the sound he said: “Who is this? I will find out,” and he called to his son, but though he called he could not wake him. “Let him sleep on,” he said, “he is tired, I will go myself alone,” so he came down from the tree and approached, but the Nāga maidens when they saw him sank into the earth with all their instruments and departed to the abode of the Nāgas, and the Bodhisatta was left alone. The brahmin, standing near, questioned him in these two verses:*";
P_HTM[64]="***14. “What youth is this, red-eyed, who here is seen,*";
P_HTM[65]="***His shoulders broad with ample space between,*";
P_HTM[66]="***And what ten maidens these who guard him round*";
P_HTM[67]="***Clad in fair robes, with golden bracelets bound!*";
P_HTM[68]="***15. Who are you ’midst this forest greenery,*";
P_HTM[69]="***Bright like a fire just newly dressed with ghee?*";
P_HTM[70]="***Are you a Sakka or a Yakkha, say,*";
P_HTM[71]="***Or some famed Nāga prince of potent sway?”*";
P_HTM[72]="***When the Great Being heard him he thought: “If I say that I am one of the Sakkas he will believe me, for he is a brahmin; but I must speak only the truth today,” so he thus declared his Nāga birth:*";
P_HTM[73]="***16. “I am a Nāga great in Powers, invincible with poisonous breath,*";
P_HTM[74]="***A prosperous land with all its sons my angry bite could smite with death;*";
P_HTM[75]="***17. My mother is Samuddajā, Dhataraṭṭha as sire I claim,*";
P_HTM[76]="***Sudassana’s young brother I, and Bhūridatta is my name.”*";
P_HTM[77]="***But when the Great Being said this, he reflected: “This brahmin is fierce and cruel, he may betray me to a snake-charmer, and so hinder my performance of the fast; what if I were to take him to the Nāga kingdom and, give him great honour there, and thus carry on my fast without a break” So he said to him, “O brahmin, I will give you great honour, come to the pleasant home of the Nāgas, let us go at once there.” “My lord, I have a son, I will go if he comes too.” The Bodhisatta replied, “Go, brahmin, and fetch him,” and he thus described to him his own dwelling:*";
P_HTM[78]="***18. “Awful and dark is yonder lake, incessant storms its waters toss,*";
P_HTM[79]="***That is my home: my subjects there all hear and none my bidding cross;*";
P_HTM[80]="***19. Plunge you beneath the dark blue waves, the peacocks and the herons call,*";
P_HTM[81]="***Plunge and enjoy the bliss there stored for those who keep the precepts all.”*";
P_HTM[82]="***The brahmin went and told this to his son and brought him, and the Great Being took them both and went to the bank of the Yamunā, and, standing there, said:*";
P_HTM[83]="***20. “Fear not, O brahmin with your son, follow my words and you shall live*";
P_HTM[84]="***Honoured and happy in my home with all the pleasures I can give.”*";
P_HTM[85]="***So saying the Great Being by his power brought the father and son to the dwelling of the Nāgas, where they obtained a divine condition; and he bestowed on them divine prosperity and gave to each of them four hundred Nāga maidens, and great was the prosperity they enjoyed. The Bodhisatta continued to practise his fast diligently, and every fortnight he went to pay honour to his parents and discoursed on the Dhamma; and then going to the brahmin he inquired concerning his health, and said to him, “Tell me anything that you want, enjoy yourself without discontent,” and, after giving a kindly greeting also to Somadatta, he proceeded to his own home.*";
P_HTM[86]="***The brahmin, after dwelling a year in the Nāga realm, through his lack of previous merit began to grow discontented and longed to return to the world of men; the dwelling-place of the Nāgas seemed like a hell to him, the adorned palace like a prison, the Nāga maidens with their ornaments like Yakkhinis. He thought to himself, “I am discontented, I will learn what Somadatta thinks,” so he went to him and said: “Are you not discontented, my son?” “Why should I be discontented? Let us not feel any such feeling. Are you discontented, father?” “Yes, my son?” “Why so?” “Because I do not see your mother and your brothers and sisters; come, my son, let us go.” He answered that he would not go, but, being repeatedly entreated by his father, he at last consented.*";
P_HTM[87]="***The brahmin reflected: “I have won my son’s consent, but if I tell Bhūridatta that I am discontented, he will heap more honour upon me, and I shall not be able to go. My object can only be attained in one way. I will describe his prosperity and then ask him, ‘Why do you leave all this glory and go to the world of men to practise the observance of the fast?’ When he answers, ‘For the sake of obtaining heaven,’ I will tell him, ‘far more then should we do so, who have made our livelihood by slaughtering living creatures. I too will go to the world of men, and see my kindred, and will then leave the world and follow the Dhamma of the ascetics,’ and then he will let me depart.” Having thus determined, one day when the other came up to him and asked him whether he was discontented, he assured him that nothing was wanting that he could supply, and, without making any mention of his intended departure, at first he only described the other’s prosperity in the following verses:*";
P_HTM[88]="***21. “Level the ground on every side, with tagara blossoms whitened o’er,*";
P_HTM[89]="***Red with the cochineal insect-swarms, the brightest verdure for its floor,*";
P_HTM[90]="***22. With sacred shrines in every wood, and swan-filled lakes which charm the eye,*";
P_HTM[91]="***While strewn the fallen lotus leaves as carpets on the surface lie,*";
P_HTM[92]="***23. The thousand-columned palaces with halls where heavenly maidens dance,*";
P_HTM[93]="***Their columns all of jewels wrought, whose angles in the sunshine glance;*";
P_HTM[94]="***24. You have indeed a glorious home, won by your merits as thine own,*";
P_HTM[95]="***When all desires are gratified as soon as each new wish is known;*";
P_HTM[96]="***25. You envy not the great Sakka’s halls, what are his stateliest courts to thine?*";
P_HTM[97]="***Your palaces more glorious are and with more dazzling splendours shine.”*";
P_HTM[98]="***The Great Being replied, “Say not so, brahmin; our glory compared to Sakka’s seems only as a mustard-seed beside Mount Meru, we are not even equal to his attendants,” and he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[99]="***26. “Our highest thoughts cannot conceive the imperial pomp round Sakka’s throne,*";
P_HTM[100]="***Or the four Regents in his court, each in his own appointed zone.”*";
P_HTM[101]="***When he heard him repeat his words, “This palace of yours is Sakka’s palace,” he said: “I have had this in my mind, and it is through my desire to obtain Vejayanta that I practise the observance of the fast,” then he repeated a verse, describing his own earnest wish:*";
P_HTM[102]="***27. “I long intensely for the home of the immortal saints on high,*";
P_HTM[103]="***Therefore upon that ant-hill top I keep the fast unceasingly.” The brahmin, on hearing this, thought to himself, “Now I have gained my opportunity,” and filled with joy he repeated two verses, begging leave to depart:*";
P_HTM[104]="***28. “I too sought deer when with my son into that forest glade I sped;*";
P_HTM[105]="***The friends I left at home know not whether I am alive or dead;*";
P_HTM[106]="***29. O Bhūridatta, let us go, you glorious lord of Kāsi race,*";
P_HTM[107]="***Let us depart and see once more our kindred in their native place.”*";
P_HTM[108]="***The Bodhisatta answered:*";
P_HTM[109]="***30. “ ’Tis my desire that you should dwell with us, and here pass happy hours;*";
P_HTM[110]="***Where in the upper world of men will you find haunts of peace like ours?*";
P_HTM[111]="***31. But would you dwell awhile elsewhere and yet enjoy our pleasures still,*";
P_HTM[112]="***Then take my leave, go, see your friends, and be as happy as you will.”*";
P_HTM[113]="***And thinking to himself, “If he obtains this happiness through me he will be sure not to tell it to anyone else, I will give him my jewel which grants all desires,” he gave him the jewel and said:*";
P_HTM[114]="***32. “The bearer of this heavenly gem beholds his children and his farm;*";
P_HTM[115]="***Take it, O brahmin, and begone, its bearer never comes to harm.”*";
P_HTM[116]="***The brahmin replied:*";
P_HTM[117]="***33. “I understand your words too well, I am grown old as you can see,*";
P_HTM[118]="***I will adopt the ascetic life, what are life’s pleasures now to me?”*";
P_HTM[119]="***The Bodhisatta said:*";
P_HTM[120]="***34. “If you should fail and break your vow then seek life’s common joys once more,*";
P_HTM[121]="***And come and find me out again and I will give you ample store.”*";
P_HTM[122]="***The brahmin answered:*";
P_HTM[123]="***35. “O Bhūridatta, I accept with thanks the offer you have made;*";
P_HTM[124]="***Should the occasion come to me I will return to claim your aid.”*";
P_HTM[125]="***The Great Being perceived that he had no desire to abide there, so he commanded some young Nāgas to take him to the world of men.*";
P_HTM[126]="***The Teacher thus described what happened:*";
P_HTM[127]="***36. “Then Bhūridatta gave commands to four of his young Nāgas, ‘Go,*";
P_HTM[128]="***Take you this brahmin in your charge and lead him where he wants to go.’*";
P_HTM[129]="***37. The four attendants heard the words, at once their lord’s command was done:*";
P_HTM[130]="***They brought the brahmin to the place and leaving him returned alone.”*";
P_HTM[131]="***Then the brahmin, as he went along, said to his son, “Somadatta, we wounded a deer in this place and a boar in that,” and seeing a lake on the way he exclaimed, “Somadatta, let us bathe,” so they both took off their divine ornaments and clothes, and wrapping them up in a bundle laid them on the bank and bathed. At that very moment the ornaments vanished and returned to the Nāga world, and their former poor yellow clothes were wrapped round their bodies, and their bows, arrows, and spears came back as they were before. “We are undone, father,” bewailed Somadatta; but his father comforted him, “Fear not; as long as there are deer we shall make a livelihood by killing deer in the forest.”*";
P_HTM[132]="***Somadatta’s mother heard of their coming, and having gone to meet them she brought them home and she satisfied them with food and drink. When the brahmin had eaten and fallen asleep she asked her son, “Where have you been all this time?” “O mother, we were carried by the Nāga king Bhūridatta to the great Nāga realm, and we have now come back, as we were discontented.” “Have you brought any jewels? “None, mother.” “Why? Did he not give any to you?” “Mother, Bhūridatta gave to my father a jewel which grants all desires, but he would not accept it.” “Wherefore?” “He is going, they say, to become an ascetic.” “What, after leaving me so long with the burden of the children and dwelling in the Nāga realm, he is now going to become an ascetic?” so flying into a passion she struck his back with the spoon which she used for frying the rice and upbraided him, saying: “You wicked brahmin, why did you say that you were going to become an ascetic and so refuse the precious jewel, and why did you come here and not take the ascetic’s vow? Depart from my house directly.” But he said to her, “Good lady, be not angry, as long as there are deer in the forest I will support you and your children.” So the next day he went with his son into the forest and followed there the same livelihood as before. Virtue*";
P_HTM[133]="***Now at that time a Garuḷa bird which dwelt in a silk-cotton tree in the Himālayas in a region of the great southern ocean swept up the water with the wind of its wings, and swooping down on the Nāga region seized a Nāga king by the head; but this was the period when the Garuḷas did not know how to seize the Nāgas, they learned how in the Paṇḍarajātaka [Ja 518]. So although he seized it by the head, without scattering the water, he carried it dangling to the summit of the Himālayas.*";
P_HTM[134]="***A brahmin, an old inhabitant of Kāsi, who was following the life of an ascetic in the region of the Himālayas, was dwelling in a hut of leaves which he had built, and there was a great banyan tree at the end of his covered walk, and he had made his abode by day at its root. The Garuḷa carried the Nāga to the top of the banyan, and the Nāga as it hung down in its effort to escape twined its tail round a branch. The Garuḷa, being unaware of it, flew up to heaven by dint of his great strength and carried up the banyan tree without its roots. The bird then bore the Nāga to the silk-cotton tree and struck it with his beak and split open its belly, and having eaten the fat, dropped the body into the middle of the sea. The banyan tree as it fell made a great noise, and the bird, wondering what noise it could be, looked down, and seeing the tree thought to himself, “From whence did I carry that off?” and recognising that it was the banyan at the end of the ascetic’s covered walk, he considered, “This tree was of great service to him, is an evil consequence following me or not? I will ask him and learn.”*";
P_HTM[135]="***So he went to him in the guise of a young pupil; now at that moment the ascetic was smoothing the earth down. So the king of the Garuḷas, having saluted him and sat down on one side, asked him, as if he were himself ignorant of the fact, what had once grown in that spot. He replied, “A Garuḷa was carrying off a Nāga for his food, which twined its tail round a branch of a banyan tree in order to escape; but the bird by its great strength made a spring upwards and flew off, and so the tree was torn up; this is the place out of which it was torn.” “What demerit accrued to the bird?” “If he did it not knowing what he did, it was only ignorance, not a wrong.” “What was the case with the Nāga?” “He did not seize the tree with an intent to hurt it, therefore he also has no demerit.” The Garuḷa was pleased with the ascetic and said: “My friend, I am that king of the Garuḷas, and I am pleased with your explanation of my question. Now you live here in the forest and I know the Ālambāyana spell of priceless value. I will give it to you as my fee for your lesson, be pleased to accept it.” “I know enough about spells, you can be going.” But he continued to press him and at last he persuaded him to accept it, so he gave him the spell and showed him the medicines and departed.*";
P_HTM[136]="***Now at that time a poor brahmin in Benares had got deeply into debt, and being pressed by his creditors he said to himself, “Why should I go on living here? I am sure it will be better to go into the forest and die.” So having gone from his home he went by successive journeys till he came to that hermitage. He entered it and pleased the ascetic by his diligent discharge of his duties. The ascetic said to himself, “This brahmin is very helpful to me, I will give him the divine spell which the king of Garuḷas gave to me.” So he said to him, “O brahmin, I know the Ālambāyana spell, I will give it to you, do you take it.” The other replied, “Peace, good friend, I do not want any spell,” but the other pressed him again and again and at last persuaded him; so he gave him the spell and showed him the medicines necessary for it and described the entire method of using it.*";
P_HTM[137]="***The brahmin said to himself, “I have gained a means of livelihood,” so after staying there a few days, he made the excuse of an attack of rheumatism, and after begging the ascetic’s forgiveness he took his respectful leave of him and departed from the forest, and by successive stages reached the bank of the Yamunā, from whence he went along the high road repeating the spell.*";
P_HTM[138]="***Now at that very time a thousand Nāga youths who waited on Bhūridatta were carrying that jewel which grants all desires. They had come out of the Nāga world and had stopped and placed it on a hillock of sand, and there, after playing all night in the water by its radiance, they had put on all their ornaments at the approach of morning, and, causing the jewel to contract its splendour, had sat down, guarding it. The brahmin reached the spot while he was repeating his charm, and they, on hearing the charm, seized with terror lest it should be the Garuḷa king, plunged into the earth without staying to take the jewel and fled to the Nāga world. The brahmin, when he saw the jewel, exclaimed, “My spell has at once succeeded,” and he joyfully seized the jewel and went on his way. Now at that very time the outcaste brahmin was entering the forest with his son Somadatta to kill deer, and when he saw the jewel on the other’s hand he said to his son, “Is not this the jewel which Bhūridatta gave to us?” “Yes,” said his son, “it is the very same.” “Well, I will tell him its evil qualities and so deceive him and get the jewel for my own.” “O father, you did not keep the jewel before when Bhūridatta gave it to you: this brahmin will assuredly cheat you, be silent about it.” “Let be, my son; you shall see which can cheat best, he or I.” So he went to Ālambāyana and addressed him:*";
P_HTM[139]="***38. “Where did you get that gem of yours, bringing good luck and fair to th’ eye;*";
P_HTM[140]="***But having certain signs and marks, which I can recognise it by?”*";
P_HTM[141]="***Ālambāyana answered in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[142]="***39. “This morning as I walked along I saw the jewel where it lay,*";
P_HTM[143]="***Its thousand red-eyed guards all fled and left it there to be my prey.”*";
P_HTM[144]="***The outcaste’s son, wishing to cheat him, proceeded in three verses to tell him the jewel’s evil qualities, desiring to secure it himself:*";
P_HTM[145]="***40. “Carefully tended, honoured well, and worn or stowed away with care,*";
P_HTM[146]="***It brings its owner all good things, however large his wishes are;*";
P_HTM[147]="***41. But if he shows it disrespect and wears or stows it heedlessly,*";
P_HTM[148]="***Sore will he rue the finding it, ’twill only bring him misery.*";
P_HTM[149]="***42. Do you have nought to do therewith, you have no skill such ware to hold:*";
P_HTM[150]="***Give it to me and take instead a hundred pounds of yellow gold.”*";
P_HTM[151]="***Then Ālambāyana spoke a verse in reply:*";
P_HTM[152]="***43. “I will not sell this gem of mine, though cows or jewels offered be;*";
P_HTM[153]="***Its signs and marks I know full well, and it shall ne’er be bought from me.”*";
P_HTM[154]="***The brahmin said:*";
P_HTM[155]="***44. “If cows or jewels will not buy from you that jewel which you wear,*";
P_HTM[156]="***What is the price you’ll sell it for? Come, a true answer let me hear.”*";
P_HTM[157]="***Ālambāyana answered:*";
P_HTM[158]="***45. “He who can tell me where to find the mighty Nāga in his pride,*";
P_HTM[159]="***To him this jewel will I give, flashing its rays on every side.”*";
P_HTM[160]="***The brahmin said:*";
P_HTM[161]="***46.“ Is this perchance the Garuḷa king, come in brahmin’s guise today,*";
P_HTM[162]="***Seeking, while on the track for food, to seize the Nāga as his prey?”*";
P_HTM[163]="***Ālambāyana answered:*";
P_HTM[164]="***47. “No bird-king I, a Garuḷa ne’er came across these eyes of mine,*";
P_HTM[165]="***I am a brahmin doctor, friend, and snakes and snake-bites are my line.”*";
P_HTM[166]="***The brahmin said:*";
P_HTM[167]="***48. “What special power do you possess, or have you learned some subtle skill*";
P_HTM[168]="***Which gives you this immunity to handle snakes whose fangs can kill?”*";
P_HTM[169]="***He replied, thus describing his power:*";
P_HTM[170]="***49. “The ascetic Kosiya in the wood kept a long painful penance well,*";
P_HTM[171]="***And at the end a Garuḷa revealed to him the serpent-spell.*";
P_HTM[172]="***50. That holiest sage, who dwelt retired upon a lonely mountain height,*";
P_HTM[173]="***I waited on with earnest zeal and served unwearied day and night;*";
P_HTM[174]="***51. And at the last to recompense my years of faithful ministry*";
P_HTM[175]="***My blessed teacher did reveal the heavenly secret unto me.*";
P_HTM[176]="***52. Trusting in this all-powerful spell, the fiercest snakes I do not fear;*";
P_HTM[177]="***I counteract their deadliest bites, I, Ālambāyana the seer.”*";
P_HTM[178]="***As he heard him, the outcaste brahmin thought to himself, “This Ālambāyana is ready to give the pearl of gems to anyone who shows him the Nāga; I will show him Bhūridatta and so secure the gem,” so he uttered this verse as he consulted with his son:*";
P_HTM[179]="***53. “Let us secure this gem, my son; come, Somadatta, let’s be quick,*";
P_HTM[180]="***Nor lose our luck as did the fool who smashed his meal-dish with his stick.”*";
P_HTM[181]="***Somadatta replied:*";
P_HTM[182]="***54. “All honour due he showed to you, when you came in that stranger’s way;*";
P_HTM[183]="***And would you turn and rob him now, his kindly welcome to repay?*";
P_HTM[184]="***55. If you want wealth, go seek for it from Bhūridatta as before;*";
P_HTM[185]="***Ask him and he will gladly give all that your heart desires, and more.”*";
P_HTM[186]="***The brahmin said:*";
P_HTM[187]="***56. “That which, by lucky fortune brought, in bowl or hand all ready lies,*";
P_HTM[188]="***Eat it at once nor questions ask, lest you should lose the offered prize.”*";
P_HTM[189]="***Somadatta replied:*";
P_HTM[190]="***57. “Earth yawns for him, hell’s fiercest fires await the traitor at the end,*";
P_HTM[191]="***Or, with fell hunger gnawed, he pines a living death, who cheats his friend.*";
P_HTM[192]="***58. Ask Bhūridatta, he will give, if you want wealth, the wished-for boon;*";
P_HTM[193]="***But if you do wrong, I fear that the wrong will find you out right soon.”*";
P_HTM[194]="***The brahmin said:*";
P_HTM[195]="***59. “But, through a sacrifice brahmins may do wrong and yet be made clean;*";
P_HTM[196]="***Great sacrifices we will bring and, so made pure, escape the wrong.”*";
P_HTM[197]="***Somadatta said:*";
P_HTM[198]="***60. “Cease your vile talk, I will not stay, this very moment I depart,*";
P_HTM[199]="***I will not go one step with you, this baseness rankling in your heart.”*";
P_HTM[200]="***So saying, the wise youth, rejecting his father’s counsel, exclaimed with a loud voice which startled the deities in the neighbourhood, “I will not go with such a sinner,” and fled away as his father stood looking on; and, plunging into the recesses of the Himālayas, there became an ascetic, and, having practised the Super Knowledges and Attainments and become perfected in Absorption, he was reborn in the Brahmā Realm. The Teacher explained this in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[201]="***61. “The noble Somadatta thus rebuked his father where he stood,*";
P_HTM[202]="***Startling the Bhūtas of the place, and turned and hurried from the wood.”*";
P_HTM[203]="***The outcaste brahmin thought to himself, “Whither will Somadatta go except to his own home?” and when he saw that Ālambāyana was a little vexed, he said to him, “Do not mind, Ālambāyana, I will introduce you to Bhūridatta.” So he took him and went to the place where the snake king kept the Uposatha; and when he saw him lying on the top of the ant-hill with his hoods contracted he stood a little way off, and holding out his hand uttered two verses:*";
P_HTM[204]="***62. “Seize this Nāga-king where he lies and snatch forthwith that priceless gem,*";
P_HTM[205]="***Which bright-red like a lady-bird glows on his head a diadem.*";
P_HTM[206]="***63. On yonder ant-heap see! He lies, stretched out without a thought of fear,*";
P_HTM[207]="***Spread like a heap of cotton there, seize him before he knows you’re near.”*";
P_HTM[208]="***The Great Being opened his eyes, and, seeing the outcaste, he pondered, “I took this fellow to my Nāga home and settled him in high prosperity, but he would not accept the jewel which I gave him, and now he is come here with a snake-charmer. But if I were angry with him for his treachery, my moral character would be injured. Now my first of all duties is to keep the Uposatha in its four periods, that must remain inviolate; so whether Ālambāyana cut me in pieces or cook me or fix me on a spit, I must at all events not be angry with him.” So closing his eyes and following the highest ideal of determination he placed his head between his hoods and lay perfectly motionless.*";
P_HTM[209]="***Sport*";
P_HTM[210]="***Then the outcaste brahmin exclaimed, “O Ālambāyana, do you seize this Nāga and give me the gem.” Ālambāyana, being delighted at seeing the Nāga, and not caring the least for the gem, threw it into his hand, saying: “Take it, brahmin,” but the jewel slipped out of his hand, and as soon as it fell it went into the ground and was lost in the Nāga world. The brahmin found himself bereft of the three things, the priceless gem, Bhūridatta’s friendship, and his son, and went off to his home, loudly lamenting, “I have lost everything, I would not follow my son’s words.” But Ālambāyana, having first anointed his body with divine drugs and eaten a little and so fortified himself within, uttered the divine spell, and, going up to the Bodhisatta, seized him by the tail, and, holding him fast, opened his mouth and, having himself eaten a drug, spat into it. The pure-natured Nāga king did not allow himself to feel any anger through fear of violating the moral precepts, and though he opened his eyes did not open them to the full. After he had made the snake full of the magic drug, and, holding him by the tail with his head downwards, had shaken him and made him vomit the food he had swallowed, he stretched him out at full length on the ground. Then pressing him like a pillow with his hands he crushed his bones to pieces, and then, seizing his tail, pounded him as if he were beating cloth. The Great Being felt no anger even though he suffered such pain. The Teacher described this in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[211]="***64. “By dint of drugs of magic power and muttering spells with evil skill,*";
P_HTM[212]="***He seized and held him without fear and made him subject to his will.”*";
P_HTM[213]="***Having thus made the Great Being helpless, he prepared a basket of creepers and threw him into it; at first his huge body would not go into it, but after kicking it with his heels he forced it to enter. Then, going to a certain village, he set the basket down in the middle of it and shouted aloud, “Let all come here who wish to see a snake dance,” and all the villagers crowded round. Then he called to the Nāga king to come out, and the Great Being reflected: “It will be best for me to please the crowd and dance today; perhaps he will gain plenty of money and in his content will let me go; whatever he makes me do, I will do it.” So when Ālambāyana took him out of the basket and told him to swell out he assumed his full size; and so when he told him to become small or round or heaped up like a bank, or to assume one hood or two hoods or three or four or five or ten or twenty or any number up to a hundred, or to become high or low, or to make his body visible or invisible, or to become blue or yellow or red or white or pink, or to emit water, or to emit water and smoke, he made himself assume all these various appearances as he was commanded and exhibited his dancing powers. No one who witnessed it could keep back his tears and the people brought gold coin, gold, garments, ornaments, and the like, so that he received a hundred thousand pieces in that village alone.*";
P_HTM[214]="***Now at first, after he had captured the Great Being, he had intended to let him go when he had gained a thousand pieces; but when he had made such a harvest, he said: “I have gained all this money in one little village, what a fortune I shall get in a city!” So, after settling his family there, he made a basket all covered with jewels, and having thrown the Great Being into it, he mounted a luxurious carriage and started with a great train of attendants. He made him dance in every village and town which they passed, and at last they reached Benares. He gave the snake king honey and fried grain, and killed frogs for him to eat; but he would not take the food, through fear of not being released from his captivity; but even though he did not take his food, the other made him show his sports, and began with the four villages at the gates of the city, where he spent a month. Then on the Uposatha of the fifteenth he announced to the king that he would that day exhibit the snake’s dancing powers before him. The king in consequence made a proclamation by beat of drum and collected a large crowd, and tiers of scaffolding were erected in the courtyard of the palace. Entering the City*";
P_HTM[215]="***But on the day when the Bodhisatta was seized by Ālambāna, the Great Being’s mother saw in a dream that a black man with red eyes had cut off her arm with a sword and was carrying it away, streaming with blood. She sprang up in terror, but on feeling her right arm she recognised it to be only a dream. Then she considered in herself, “I have seen an evil frightful dream; it portends some misfortune either to my four sons or to king Dhataraṭṭha or to myself.” But presently she fixed her thoughts especially on the Bodhisatta, “Now all the others are dwelling in the Nāga world, but he has gone into the world of men resolved to keep the precepts and under a vow to observe the Uposatha; therefore I wonder whether some snake-charmer or Garuḷa has seized him.” So she thought of him more and more, and at last at the end of a fortnight she became quite dejected, saying: “My son could not live a whole fortnight without me, surely some evil must have befallen him.” After a month had passed there was no limit to the tears which flowed from her eyes in her distress, and she sat watching the road by which he would come back, continually saying: “Surely he will now be coming home, surely be will now be coming home.” Then her eldest son Sudassana came with a great retinue to pay a visit to his parents at the end of a month’s absence, and having left his attendants outside he ascended the palace, and after saluting his mother stood on one side; but she said nothing to him as she kept sorrowing for Bhūridatta. He thought to himself, “Whenever I have returned before my mother has always been pleased and given me a kind welcome, but today she is in deep distress; what can be the reason?” So he asked her, saying:*";
P_HTM[216]="***65. “You see me come with all success, my every wish has hit the mark;*";
P_HTM[217]="***And yet you show no signs of joy, and your whole countenance is dark,*";
P_HTM[218]="***66. Dark as a lotus rudely plucked which droops and withers in the hand;*";
P_HTM[219]="***Is this the welcome which you give when I come back from foreign land?”*";
P_HTM[220]="***Even at these words of his she still said nothing. Then Sudassana thought: “Can she have been abused or slandered by someone?” So he uttered another verse, questioning her:*";
P_HTM[221]="***67. “Has anyone upbraided you or are you racked with secret pain,*";
P_HTM[222]="***That thus your countenance is dark, e’en when you see me back again?”*";
P_HTM[223]="***She replied as follows:*";
P_HTM[224]="***68. “I saw an evil dream, my son, a month ago this very day;*";
P_HTM[225]="***There came a man who lopped my arm as on my bed I sleeping lay,*";
P_HTM[226]="***And carried off the bleeding limb, no tears of mine his hand could stay.*";
P_HTM[227]="***69. Blank terror overpowers my heart, and since I saw that cruel sight*";
P_HTM[228]="***A moment’s peace or happiness I have not known by day or night.”*";
P_HTM[229]="***When she had said this she burst out lamenting, “I cannot see anywhere my darling son your youngest brother; some evil must have happened to him,” and she exclaimed:*";
P_HTM[230]="***70. “He whom fair maidens in their bloom used to be proud to wait upon,*";
P_HTM[231]="***Their hair adorned with golden nets, Bhūridatta, alas, is gone;*";
P_HTM[232]="***71. He whom stout soldiers used to guard, with their drawn swords, a gallant train,*";
P_HTM[233]="***Flashing like kaṇikāra flowers, alas, I look for him in vain!*";
P_HTM[234]="***72. I must pursue your brother’s track and find where he has fixed to dwell,*";
P_HTM[235]="***Fulfilling his ascetic vow, and learn myself if all be well.”*";
P_HTM[236]="***Having uttered these words she set out with his retinue as well as her own.*";
P_HTM[237]="***Now Bhūridatta’s wives had not felt anxious when they did not find him on the top of the ant-hill, as they said that he was no doubt gone to his mother’s home; but when they heard that she was coming weeping because she could nowhere see her son, they went to meet her and fell at her feet, making a loud lamentation, “O lady, it is a month today since we last saw your son.”*";
P_HTM[238]="***The Teacher described this as follows:*";
P_HTM[239]="***73. “The wives of Bhūridatta there beheld his mother drawing nigh,*";
P_HTM[240]="***And putting out their arms they wept with an exceeding bitter cry;*";
P_HTM[241]="***74. Bhūridatta, your son, went hence a month ago, we know not where;*";
P_HTM[242]="***Whether he be alive or dead we cannot tell in our despair.”*";
P_HTM[243]="***The mother joined with her daughters-in-law in their lamentations in the middle of the road and then went up with them into the palace, and there her grief burst forth as she looked on her son’s bed:*";
P_HTM[244]="***75-79. “Like a lone bird whose brood is slain, when it beholds its empty nest,*";
P_HTM[245]="***So sorrow, when I look in vain for Bhūridatta, fills my breast.*";
P_HTM[246]="***Deep in my heart my grief for him burns with a fierce and steady glow*";
P_HTM[247]="***Just like the furnace which a smith carries where’er he is called to go.”*";
P_HTM[248]="***As she thus wept, Bhūridatta’s house seemed to be filled with one continuous sound like the hollow roar of the ocean. No one could remain unmoved, and the whole dwelling was like a Sāl-forest smitten by the storm of doomsday.*";
P_HTM[249]="***The Teacher thus described it:*";
P_HTM[250]="***80. “Like Sāl trees prostrate in a storm, their branches broken, roots uptorn,*";
P_HTM[251]="***So mother, wives, and children, lay in that lone dwelling-place forlorn.”*";
P_HTM[252]="***Ariṭṭha and Subhaga also, the brothers, who had come to visit their parents, heard the noise and entered Bhūridatta’s dwelling and tried to comfort their mother.*";
P_HTM[253]="***The Teacher thus described it:*";
P_HTM[254]="***81. “Ariṭṭha then and Subhaga, eager to help and comfort, come,*";
P_HTM[255]="***Hearing the sounds of wild lament which rose in Bhūridatta’s home;*";
P_HTM[256]="***82. ‘Mother, be calm, your wailings end, this is the lot of all who live;*";
P_HTM[257]="***They all must pass from birth to birth: change rules in all things, do not grieve.’ ”*";
P_HTM[258]="***Samuddajā replied:*";
P_HTM[259]="***83. “My son, I know it but too well, this is the lot of all who live,*";
P_HTM[260]="***But now no common loss is mine, left thus forlorn I can but grieve;*";
P_HTM[261]="***84. Verily if I see him not, my jewel and my soul’s delight,*";
P_HTM[262]="***My Bhūridatta, I will end my wretched life this very night.”*";
P_HTM[263]="***Her sons answered:*";
P_HTM[264]="***85. “Mourn not, dear mother, still your grief, we’ll bring our brother back;*";
P_HTM[265]="***Through the wide earth on every side we will pursue his track*";
P_HTM[266]="***86. O’er hill and dale, through village, town and city, till he’s found,*";
P_HTM[267]="***Within ten days we promise you to bring him safe and sound.”*";
P_HTM[268]="***Then Sudassana thought: “If we all three go in one direction there will be much delay: we must go to three different directions, one to the world of the gods, one to the Himālayas, and one to the world of men. But if Kāṇāriṭṭha goes to the land of men he will set that village or town on fire where he shall happen to see Bhūridatta, for he is cruel-natured, it will not do to send him,” so he said to him, “Do you go to the world of the gods; if the gods have carried him to their world in order to learn the Dhamma from him, then do you bring him thence.” But he said to Subhaga, “Do you go to the Himālayas and search for Bhūridatta in the five rivers and come back.” But as he was resolving to go himself to the world of men, he reflected: “If I go as a young man people will revile me; I must go as an ascetic, for ascetics are dear and welcome to men.” So he took the garb of an ascetic and, after bidding his mother farewell, set out.*";
P_HTM[269]="***Now the Bodhisatta had a sister, born of another mother, named Accimukhī, who had a very great love for the Bodhisatta. When she saw Subhaga setting out, she said to him, “Brother, I am greatly troubled, I will go with you.” “Sister,” he replied, “you cannot go with me, for I have assumed an ascetic’s dress.” “I will become a little frog and I will go inside your matted hair.” On his consenting, she became a young frog and lay down in his matted hair. Subhaga resolved that he would search for him from the very commencement, so asked his wife where he spent the Uposatha and went there first of all. When he saw there the blood on the spot where the Great Being had been seized by Ālambāna and the place where the latter had made the basket of creeping plants, he felt sure that the Bodhisatta had been seized by a snake-charmer and being overcome with grief, and having his eyes filled with tears, he followed Ālambāna’s track.*";
P_HTM[270]="***When he came to the village where he had first displayed the dancing, he asked the people whether a snake-charmer had shown his tricks there with such and such a kind of snake. “Yes, Ālambāna showed these tricks a month ago.” “Did he gain anything thereby?” “Yes, he gained a hundred thousand pieces in this one place.” “Where has he gone now?” “To such and such a village.” He went off and, asking his way as he went, he at last arrived at the palace-gate.*";
P_HTM[271]="***Now at that very moment Ālambāna had come there, just bathed and anointed, and wearing a tunic of fine cloth, and making his attendant carry his jewelled basket. A great crowd collected, a seat was placed for the king, and he, while he was still within the palace, sent a message, “I am coming, let him make the king of snakes play.” Then Ālambāna placed the jewelled basket on a variegated rug, and gave the sign, saying: “Come here, O snake king.” At that moment Sudassana was standing at the edge of the crowd, while the Great Being put out his head and looked round surveying the people. Now Nāgas look at a crowd for two reasons, to see whether any Garuḷa is near or any actors; if they see any Garuḷas, they do not dance for fear, if any actors, they do not dance for shame. The Great Being, as he looked, beheld his brother in the crowd, and, repressing the tears which filled his eyes, he came out of the basket and went up to his brother. The crowd, seeing him approach, retreated in fear and Sudassana was left alone; so he went up to him and laid his head on his foot and wept; and Sudassana also wept. The Great Being at last stopped weeping and went into the basket. Ālambāna said to himself, “This Nāga must have bitten yonder ascetic, I must comfort him,” so he went up to him and said:*";
P_HTM[272]="***87. “It slipped out of my hand and seized your foot with all its might;*";
P_HTM[273]="***Did it chance bite you? Never fear, there’s no harm in its bite.”*";
P_HTM[274]="***Sudassana wished to have some talk with him, so he answered:*";
P_HTM[275]="***88. “This snake of yours can harm me not,*";
P_HTM[276]="***I am a match for him, I wot;*";
P_HTM[277]="***Search where you will, you will not see*";
P_HTM[278]="***One who can charm a snake like me.”*";
P_HTM[279]="***Ālambāna did not know who it was, so he answered angrily:*";
P_HTM[280]="***89. “This lout dressed out in brahmin guise challenges me today,*";
P_HTM[281]="***Let all the assembly hear my words and give us both fair play.”*";
P_HTM[282]="***Then Sudassana uttered a verse in answer:*";
P_HTM[283]="***90. “A frog shall be my champion, and let a snake be yours,*";
P_HTM[284]="***Five thousand pieces be the stake, and let us show our powers.”*";
P_HTM[285]="***Ālambāna rejoined:*";
P_HTM[286]="***91. “I am a man well-backed with means, and you a bankrupt clown;*";
P_HTM[287]="***Who will stand surety on your side, and where’s the money down?*";
P_HTM[288]="***92. There is my surety, there’s the stake in case I lose the bet;*";
P_HTM[289]="***Five thousand coins will show my powers, your challenge, see, is met.”*";
P_HTM[290]="***Sudassana heard him and said: “Well, let us show our powers for five thousand pieces,” and so undismayed he went up into the royal palace and, going up to the king his father-in-law, he said this verse:*";
P_HTM[291]="***93. “O noble monarch, hear my words, ne’er may good luck your steps forsake;*";
P_HTM[292]="***Will you be surety in my name? Five thousand pieces is the stake.”*";
P_HTM[293]="***The king thought to himself, “This ascetic asks for a very large sum, what can it mean?” So he replied:*";
P_HTM[294]="***94. “Is it some debt your father left or is it all your own,*";
P_HTM[295]="***That you should come and ask from me such an unheard-of loan?”*";
P_HTM[296]="***Sudassana repeated two verses:*";
P_HTM[297]="***95. “Ālambāna would beat me with his snake;*";
P_HTM[298]="***I with my frog his brahmin pride will break.*";
P_HTM[299]="***96. Come forth, O king, with all your train appear,*";
P_HTM[300]="***And see the beating which awaits him here.”*";
P_HTM[301]="***The king consented and went out with the ascetic. When Ālambāna saw him, he thought: “This ascetic has gone and got the king on his side, he must be some friend of the royal family,” so he grew frightened and began to follow him, saying:*";
P_HTM[302]="***97. “I do not want to humble you, I will not boast at all;*";
P_HTM[303]="***But you despise this snake too much, your pride may have a fall.”*";
P_HTM[304]="***Sudassana uttered two verses:*";
P_HTM[305]="***98. “I do not seek to humble you, a brahmin, or despise your skill;*";
P_HTM[306]="***But wherefore thus cajole the crowd with harmless snakes that cannot kill?*";
P_HTM[307]="***99. If people knew your real worth as well as I can see it plain,*";
P_HTM[308]="***Why talk of gold? A little meal would be the limit of your gain.”*";
P_HTM[309]="***Ālambāna grew angry and said:*";
P_HTM[310]="***100. “You mendicant in ass’s skin, uncombed and squalid to the sight,*";
P_HTM[311]="***You dare to scorn this snake of mine, and say forsooth it cannot bite;*";
P_HTM[312]="***101. Come near and try what it can do, learn by experience if you must;*";
P_HTM[313]="***I warrant you its harmless bite will make of you a heap of dust.”*";
P_HTM[314]="***Then Sudassana uttered a verse, mocking him:*";
P_HTM[315]="***102. “A rat or water-snake perchance may bite*";
P_HTM[316]="***And leave its poison if you anger it;*";
P_HTM[317]="***But your red-headed snake is harmless quite,*";
P_HTM[318]="***It will not bite, however much it spit.”*";
P_HTM[319]="***Ālambāna replied in two verses:*";
P_HTM[320]="***103. “I have been told by holy saints who practised penance ceaselessly,*";
P_HTM[321]="***Those who in this life give their alms will go to heaven when they die;*";
P_HTM[322]="***104. I counsel you to give at once if you have anything to give,*";
P_HTM[323]="***This snake will turn you into dust, you have but little time to live.”*";
P_HTM[324]="***Sudassana said:*";
P_HTM[325]="***105. “I too have heard from holy saints, those who give alms will go to heaven;*";
P_HTM[326]="***Give you your alms while yet you may, if you have anything that can be given.*";
P_HTM[327]="***106-107. This is no common snake of mine, she’ll make you lower your boastful tone;*";
P_HTM[328]="***A daughter of the Nāga king, and a half-sister of my own,*";
P_HTM[329]="***Accimukhī, her mouth shoots flames; her poison’s of the deadliest known.”*";
P_HTM[330]="***Then he called to her in the middle of the crowd, “O Accimukhī, come out of my matted locks and stand on my hand,” and he put out his hand; and when she heard his voice she uttered a cry like a frog three times, while she was lying in his hair, and then came out and sat on his shoulder, and springing up dropped three drops of poison on the palm of his hand and then entered again into his matted locks. Sudassana stood holding the poison and exclaimed three times, “This country will be destroyed, this country will be wholly destroyed,” the sound filled all Benares with its extent of twelve leagues. The king asked what should destroy it. “O king, I see no place where I can drop this poison.” “This earth is big enough, drop it there.” “That is not possible,” he answered, and he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[331]="***108. “If I should drop it on the ground, listen, O king, to me,*";
P_HTM[332]="***The grass and creeping plants and herbs would parched and blasted be.”*";
P_HTM[333]="***“Well then, throw it into the sky.” “That also is not possible,” he said, and he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[334]="***109. “If I should do your hest, O king, and throw it in the sky,*";
P_HTM[335]="***No rain nor snow will fall from heaven till seven long years roll by.”*";
P_HTM[336]="***“Then throw it into the water.” “That is not possible,” he said, and he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[337]="***110. “If in the water it were dropped, listen, O king, to me,*";
P_HTM[338]="***Fishes and turtles would die and all that lives in sea.”*";
P_HTM[339]="***Then the king exclaimed, “I am utterly at a loss, do you tell us some way to prevent the land being destroyed.” “O king, cause three holes to be dug here in succession.” The king did so. Sudassana filled the middle hole with drugs, the second with cowdung, the third with heavenly medicines; then he let fall the drops of poison into the middle hole. A flame, which filled the hole with smoke, burst out; this spread and caught the hole with the cowdung, and then bursting out again it caught the hole filled with the heavenly plants and consumed them all, and then itself became extinguished. Ālambāyana was standing near that hole, and the heat of the poison smote him, the colour of his skin at once vanished and he became a white leper. Filled with terror, he exclaimed three times, “I will set the snake king free.”*";
P_HTM[340]="***On hearing him the Bodhisatta came out of the jewelled basket, and assuming a form radiant with all kinds of ornaments, he stood with all the glory of Sakka. Sudassana also and Accimukhī stood by. Then Sudassana said to the king, “Do you not know whose children these are?” “I know not.” “You do not know us, but you knowest that the king of Kāsi gave his daughter Samuddajā to Dhataraṭṭha.” “I know it well, for she was my youngest sister.” “We are her sons, and you are our uncle.” Then the king embraced them and kissed their heads and wept, and brought them up into the palace, and paid them great honour.*";
P_HTM[341]="***While he was showing all kindness to Bhūridatta he asked him how Ālambāna had caught him, when he possessed such a terrible poison. Sudassana related the whole story and then said: “O great monarch, a king ought to rule his kingdom in this way,” and he taught his uncle the Dhamma. Then he said: “O uncle, our mother is pining for want of seeing Bhūridatta, we cannot stay longer away from her.” “It is right, you shall go; but I too want to see my sister; how can I see her?” “O uncle, where is our grandfather, the king of Kāsi?” “He could not bear to live without my sister, so he left his kingdom and became an ascetic, and is now dwelling in such and such a forest.” “Uncle, my mother is longing to see you and my grandfather; we will take her and go to our grandfather’s hermitage, and then you too will see him.” So they fixed a day and departed from the palace; and the king, after parting with his sister’s sons, returned weeping; and they sank into the earth and went to the Nāga world.*";
P_HTM[342]="***The Search for the Great Being*";
P_HTM[343]="***When the Great Being thus came among them, the city became filled with one universal lamentation. He himself was tired out with his month’s residence in the basket and took to a sick-bed; and there was no limit to the number of Nāgas who came to visit him, and he tired himself out, talking to them. In the meantime Kāṇāriṭṭha, who had gone to the world of the gods and did not find the Great Being there, was the first to come back; so they made him the doorkeeper of the Great Being’s sick residence, for they said that he was passionate and could keep away the crowd of Nāgas. Subhaga also, after searching all the Himālayas and after that the great ocean and the other rivers, came in the course of his wanderings to search the Yamunā. But when the outcaste brahmin saw that Ālambāna had become a leper, he thought to himself, “He has become a leper because he worried Bhūridatta; now I too, through lust of the jewel, betrayed him, although he had been my benefactor, to Ālambāna, and this crime will come upon me. Before it comes, I will go to the Yamunā and will wash away the guilt in the sacred bathing-place.” So he went down into the water, saying that he would wash away the wrong of his treachery. At that moment Subhaga came to the spot, and, hearing his words, said to himself, “This evil wretch for the sake of a gem-charm betrayed my brother, who had given him such a means of enriching himself, to Ālambāna; I will not spare his life.” So, twisting his tail round his feet and dragging him into the water, he held him down; then when he was breathless he let him remain quiet a while, and when the other lifted his head up he dragged him in again and held him down; this he repeated several times, until at last the outcaste brahmin lifted his head and said:*";
P_HTM[344]="***111. “I’m bathing at this sacred spot here in Payāga’s holy flood;*";
P_HTM[345]="***My limbs are wet with sacred drops, what cruel Yakkha seeks my blood?”*";
P_HTM[346]="***Subhaga answered him in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[347]="***112. “He who, men say, in ancient days to this proud Kāsi wrathful came,*";
P_HTM[348]="***And wrapped it round with his strong coils, that Nāga king of glorious fame,*";
P_HTM[349]="***His son am I, who hold you now: Subhaga, brahmin, is my name.”*";
P_HTM[350]="***The brahmin thought: “Bhūridatta’s brother will not spare my life, but what if I were to move him to tender-heartedness by reciting the praises of his father and mother, and then beg my life?” So he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[351]="***113. “Scion of Kāsi’s royal race divine,*";
P_HTM[352]="***Your mother born from that illustrious line,*";
P_HTM[353]="***You would not leave the meanest brahmin’s slave*";
P_HTM[354]="***To perish drowned beneath the ruthless wave.”*";
P_HTM[355]="***Subhaga thought: “This wicked brahmin thinks to deceive me and persuade me to let him go, but I will not give him his life,” so he answered, reminding him of his old deeds:*";
P_HTM[356]="***114. “A thirsty deer approached to drink – from your tree-porch your shaft flew down:*";
P_HTM[357]="***In fear and pain your victim fled, spurred by an impulse not its own;*";
P_HTM[358]="***115. Deep in the wood you saw it fall and bore it on your carrying-pole*";
P_HTM[359]="***To where a banyan’s shoots grew thick, clustering around the parent bole;*";
P_HTM[360]="***116. The parrots sported in the boughs, the kokil’s song melodious rose,*";
P_HTM[361]="***Green spread the grassy sward below, evening invited to repose;*";
P_HTM[362]="***117. But there your cruel eye perceived my brother, who the boughs among*";
P_HTM[363]="***In summer pomp of colour dressed sported with his attendant throng.*";
P_HTM[364]="***118-119. He in his joyance harmed you not, but you in malice did him slay,*";
P_HTM[365]="***An innocent victim, lo that crime comes back on your own head today,*";
P_HTM[366]="***I will not spare your life an hour, my utmost vengeance you shall pay.”*";
P_HTM[367]="***Then the brahmin thought: “He will not give me my life, but I must try my best to escape,” so he uttered the following verse:*";
P_HTM[368]="***120. “Study, the offering of prayers, libations in the sacred fire,*";
P_HTM[369]="***These three things make a brahmin’s life inviolate to mortal’s ire.”*";
P_HTM[370]="***Subhaga, when he heard this, began to hesitate and he thought to himself, “I will carry him to the Nāga world and ask my brothers about this,” so he repeated two verses:*";
P_HTM[371]="***121. “Beneath the Yamunā’s sacred stream, stretching to far Himālaya’s feet,*";
P_HTM[372]="***Lies deep the Nāga capital where Dhataraṭṭha holds his seat;*";
P_HTM[373]="***122. There all my hero brothers dwell, to them will I refer your plea,*";
P_HTM[374]="***And as their judgment shall decide, so shall your final sentence be.”*";
P_HTM[375]="***He then seized him by the neck, and, shaking him with loud abuse and revilings, carried him to the gate of the Great Being’s palace.*";
P_HTM[376]="***Wrong Speech*";
P_HTM[377]="***Kāṇāriṭṭha who had become the doorkeeper was sitting there, and when he saw that the other was being dragged along so roughly he went to meet them, and said: “Subhaga, do not hurt him; all brahmins are the sons of the Mahābrahmā; if he learned that we were hurting his son he would be angry and would destroy our Nāga world. In the world brahmins rank as the highest and possess great dignity; you do not know what their dignity is, but I do.” For they say that Kāṇāriṭṭha in the birth immediately preceding this had been born as a sacrificing brahmin, and therefore he spoke so positively. Moreover being skilled in sacrificial lore from his former experiences, he said to Subhaga and the Nāga assembly, “Come, I will describe to you the character of sacrificial brahmins,” and he went on as follows:*";
P_HTM[378]="***123. “The Veda and the sacrifice, things of high worth and dignity,*";
P_HTM[379]="***Belong to brahmins as their right, however worthless they may be;*";
P_HTM[380]="***Great honour is their privilege and he who flouts them in his scorn,*";
P_HTM[381]="***Loses his wealth, breaks the Dhamma, and lives guilt-burdened and forlorn.”*";
P_HTM[382]="***Then Kāṇāriṭṭha asked Subhaga if he knew who had made the world; and when he confessed his ignorance, he told this verse to show that it was created by Brahmā the grandfather of the brahmins:*";
P_HTM[383]="***124. “Brahmins he made for study; for command*";
P_HTM[384]="***He made the Khattiyas; Vessas plough the land;*";
P_HTM[385]="***Suddas he servants made to obey the rest;*";
P_HTM[386]="***Thus from the first went forth the Lord’s behest.”*";
P_HTM[387]="***Then he said: “These brahmins have great powers, and he who conciliates them and gives them gifts is not fated to enter any new birth, but goes at once to the world of the gods,” and he repeated these verses:*";
P_HTM[388]="***125. “Kuvera, Soma, Varuṇa, of old,*";
P_HTM[389]="***Dhātā, Vidhātā, and the Sun and Moon,*";
P_HTM[390]="***Offered their sacrifices manifold,*";
P_HTM[391]="***And to their brahmin priests gave every boon.*";
P_HTM[392]="***126. The giant Ajjuna who wrought such woe,*";
P_HTM[393]="***Round whose huge bulk a thousand arms once grew,*";
P_HTM[394]="***Each several pair with its own threatening bow,*";
P_HTM[395]="***Heaped on the sacred flame the offerings due.”*";
P_HTM[396]="***Then he went on describing the glory of the brahmins and how the best gifts are to be given to them.*";
P_HTM[397]="***127. “That ancient king who feasted them so well*";
P_HTM[398]="***Became at last a god, old stories tell.*";
P_HTM[399]="***128. King Mujalinda long the fire adored,*";
P_HTM[400]="***Glutting its thirst with all the ghee he poured;*";
P_HTM[401]="***And at the last the earned reward it brought,*";
P_HTM[402]="***He found the pathway to the heaven he sought.”*";
P_HTM[403]="***He also repeated these verses to illustrate this lesson:*";
P_HTM[404]="***129. Dujīpa lived a thousand years in all,*";
P_HTM[405]="***Chariots and hosts unnumbered at his call;*";
P_HTM[406]="***But an ascetic’s life was his at last,*";
P_HTM[407]="***And from his hermitage to heaven he past.*";
P_HTM[408]="***130. Sāgara all the earth in triumph crossed,*";
P_HTM[409]="***And raised a golden sacrificial post;*";
P_HTM[410]="***None worshipped fire more zealously than he,*";
P_HTM[411]="***And he too rose to be a deity.*";
P_HTM[412]="***131. The milk and curds which Aṅga, Kāsi’s lord,*";
P_HTM[413]="***In his long offerings so profusely poured,*";
P_HTM[414]="***Swelled Gaṅgā to an ocean by their flood,*";
P_HTM[415]="***Until at last in Sakka’s courts he stood.*";
P_HTM[416]="***132. Great Sakka’s general on the heavenly plain,*";
P_HTM[417]="***By soma-offerings did the honour gain;*";
P_HTM[418]="***He who now marshals the immortal powers*";
P_HTM[419]="***Rose from a mortal sin-stained lot like ours.*";
P_HTM[420]="***133-134. Brahmā the great creator, he who made*";
P_HTM[421]="***The mountains landmarks in his altar yard,*";
P_HTM[422]="***Whose hest the Ganges in its path obeyed,*";
P_HTM[423]="***By sacrifice attained his great reward.*";
P_HTM[424]="***Then he said to him, “Brother, know you how this sea became salt and undrinkable?” “I know not, Ariṭṭha.” “You only know how to injure brahmins, listen to me.” Then he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[425]="***135. “A ascetic student, versed in prayer and spell,*";
P_HTM[426]="***Once stood upon the shore, as I’ve heard tell;*";
P_HTM[427]="***He touched the sea, it forthwith swallowed him,*";
P_HTM[428]="***And since that day has been undrinkable.”*";
P_HTM[429]="***“These brahmins are all like this,” and he uttered another verse:*";

Now the Bodhisatta heard it all as he lay in his bed, and the Nāgas told him about it; then the Bodhisatta reflected: “Ariṭṭha is telling a false legend, I will interrupt his discourse, and put true views into the assembly.” So he rose and bathed, and put on all his ornaments, and sat down in the pulpit and gathered all the Nāga multitude together. Then he sent for Ariṭṭha and said to him, “Ariṭṭha, you have spoken falsely when you describe the brahmins and the Vedas, for the sacrifice of victims by all these ceremonies of the Vedas is not held to be desirable and it does not lead to heaven, see what falsity there is in your words,” so he repeated these verses describing the various kinds of sacrifice:*";

P_HTM[625]="***“There was a king of the Videhas.”This story was told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Laṭṭhivana pleasure garden, in relation to the conversion of Uruvelā Kassapa. Now the Teacher by whom the glorious reign of Dhamma was begun, after converting the ascetics Uruvelā Kassapa and the rest, came to the pleasure garden of Laṭṭhivana, surrounded by the thousand bhikkhus who had before been ascetics, in order to persuade the king of Magadha to keep his promise; and at that time, when the Magadha king, who had come with an attending company of twelve myriads, had seated himself, after saluting the One with Ten Powers, a dispute arose among the brahmins and householders of his train, “Has Uruvelā Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual guidance of the great ascetic, or has the great ascetic placed himself under the spiritual guidance of Uruvelā Kassapa?” Then the Fortunate One thought to himself, “I will show them that Kassapa has placed himself under my spiritual guidance,” and he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[626]="***“What was it that you saw, O inhabitant of Uruvelā,*";
P_HTM[627]="***that you, renowned for your asceticism, abandoned your sacred fire?*";
P_HTM[628]="***I ask you, Kassapa, this question,*";
P_HTM[629]="***how is it that your fire sacrifice has been deserted?”*";
P_HTM[630]="***Then the elder, who understood the Buddha’s purport, replied in this verse:*";
P_HTM[631]="***“The sacrifices only speak of forms and sounds and tastes,*";
P_HTM[632]="***and sensual pleasures and women; and knowing that all these things,*";
P_HTM[633]="***being found in the elements of material existence, are filth,*";
P_HTM[634]="***I took no more delight in sacrifices or offerings.”*";
P_HTM[635]="***And in order to show that he was a disciple, he laid his head upon the Tathāgata’s feet and said: “The Fortunate One is my teacher, and I am his disciple.” So saying he rose into the air seven times, to the height of a palm tree, two palm trees, and so on to seven palm trees, and then having come down and saluted the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.*";
P_HTM[636]="***The great multitude when they saw that miracle uttered the glories of the Teacher, saying: “O great is the power of Tathāgata; though filled with such a firm conviction of his own, and though he believed himself to be a saint, Uruvelā Kassapa burst the bonds of error and was converted by the Tathāgata.” The Teacher said: “It is not wonderful that I who have now attained omniscience should have converted him; in olden time when I was the Brahmā named Nārada and still subject to passion, I burst this man’s bonds of error and made him humble,” and so saying he told the following, at the request of the audience.*";
P_HTM[637]="***In the olden time at Mithilā in the kingdom of Videha there ruled a just king of righteousness named Aṅgati. Now in the womb of his chief queen there was conceived a fair and gracious daughter, named Rujā, possessing great merit, and one who had offered prayer for a hundred thousand ages. All his other sixteen thousand wives were barren. This daughter became very dear and engaging to him. Every day he used to send her five and twenty baskets full of various flowers and delicate raiment, bidding her adorn herself with them; and he used to send her a thousand pieces, bidding her give away alms every fortnight as there was abundance of food and drink. Now he had three ministers, Vijaya, Sunāma and Alāta; and one day when the feast came round on the full moon of the fourth month, and the city and the palace were adorned like the city of the gods, having properly bathed and anointed himself and put on all sorts of ornaments, as he stood with his ministers on a terrace at an open window and saw the round moon mounting up into the clear sky, he asked his ministers, “Pleasant indeed is this clear night, with what amusement shall we divert ourselves?”*";
P_HTM[638]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[639]="***1. “There was a Khattiya king of the Videhas named Aṅgati, possessing many carriages, wealthy and with an innumerable army.*";
P_HTM[640]="***2-3. One day on the fifteenth night of the fortnight, ere the first watch was over, on the full moon of the fourth month of the rains, he gathered his ministers together, Vijaya, and Sunāma, and the general Alātaka, all wise, fathers of sons, wearing a smile, and full of experience.*";
P_HTM[641]="***4. The Videha king questioned them, “Let each of you utter his wish, this is the full moon of the fourth month, it is moonlight without any darkness; with what diversion tonight shall we pass the time away?”*";
P_HTM[642]="***Thus asked by the king, each spoke in accordance with the desire of his heart.*";
P_HTM[643]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[644]="***5-6. “Then the general Alāta thus spoke to the king, “Let us gather a gallant army together; let us go forth to battle, with a countless host of men; let us bring under your power those who have kept themselves independent; this is my opinion, let us conquer what is still unconquered.”*";
P_HTM[645]="***7-8. Hearing the words of Alāta, Sunāma spoke thus, “All your enemies, O king, are met together here, they have laid aside their strength and behave themselves with submission; today is the chief festival; war pleases me not.*";
P_HTM[646]="***9. Let them forthwith bring to us meat and drink and all kinds of food: O king, enjoy your pleasure in dance and song and music.”*";
P_HTM[647]="***10-11. Hearing the words of Sunāma, Vijaya spoke thus, “All pleasures, O great king, are always ready at your side; these are not hard to find, so as to rejoice in all your desires: but even if they are always attained, this resolution is not approved by me.*";
P_HTM[648]="***12. Let us wait on some ascetic or brahmin learned in sacred lore, one who versed in the text and its meaning may remove our doubt today as to the object of our desire.”*";
P_HTM[649]="***13. Having heard the words of Vijaya, the king Aṅgati said: “This saying of Vijaya is what pleases me also.*";
P_HTM[650]="***14. Let us wait on some ascetic or brahmin learned in sacred lore, one who versed in the sacred text and its meaning may remove our doubt today as to the object of our desire.*";
P_HTM[651]="***15. Do you all carry out this resolution; on what teacher shall we wait? Who, today, versed in the sacred text and its meaning, will remove our doubt as to the object of our desire?”*";
P_HTM[652]="***16-17. Having heard the words of Videha, Alāta replied, “There is yonder a naked ascetic in the deer-park, approved by all as wise, Guṇa, of the Kassapa family, famous, a man of varied discourse, and with a large following of disciples; wait on him, O king, he will remove our doubt.”*";
P_HTM[653]="***18. Having heard the words of Alāta, the king commanded his charioteer, “We will go to the deer-park, bring here the chariot yoked.”*";
P_HTM[654]="***19. Then they yoked his chariot made of ivory and with silver decorations, having its equipage all bright and clean, white and spotless like a clear night in its appearance.*";
P_HTM[655]="***20. Four Sindh horses were yoked therein, white as lilies, swift as the wind, well-trained, wearing golden wreaths, white the umbrella, white the car, white the horses and white the fan.*";
P_HTM[656]="***21-22. The Videha king as he set out with his counsellors shone like the moon. Many wise and strong men armed with spears and swords, mounted on horses, followed the king of heroes.*";
P_HTM[657]="***23-24. Having traversed the distance, as it were, in a moment, and alighted from the chariot, the Videha king with his ministers approached Guṇa on foot; and even the brahmins and wealthy men who were already gathered at the place the king did not order to be removed, though they left him no room.”*";
P_HTM[658]="***Surrounded by that mixed assembly the king sat on one side and made his greeting.*";
P_HTM[659]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[660]="***25. “Then the king sat down on one side on a soft mattress, covered with soft variegated squirrel-skins and with a soft cushion put over them.*";
P_HTM[661]="***26. The king, being seated, addressed him with the compliments of friendship and civility, “Are your bodily needs provided for? Are your vital airs not wasted?*";
P_HTM[662]="***27. Is your mode of life comfortable? Do you get your due supply of alms? Are your movements unimpeded? Is your sight unimpaired?”*";
P_HTM[663]="***28. Guṇa courteously answered the Videha king who was so attentive to his duties, “All my wants are provided for, and those two last-mentioned points are as I would wish them.*";
P_HTM[664]="***29. You too, are your neighbours not too strong for you? Have you such good health as you need? Does your chariot carry you well? Have you none of the sicknesses which afflict the body?”*";
P_HTM[665]="***30. The king, seeking to know the Dhamma, having received this kindly greeting, next proceeded to ask him concerning the meaning and text of the Dhamma and the rules of right conduct.*";
P_HTM[666]="***31. “How, O Kassapa, should a mortal fulfil the Dhamma towards his parents, how towards his teacher, and how towards his wife and children?*";
P_HTM[667]="***32. How should he behave towards the aged, how towards ascetics and brahmins, how should he deal with his army, how with the people in the country?*";
P_HTM[668]="***33. How should he practise the Dhamma and so eventually attain to heaven? And how do some on account of unrighteousness fall down into hell?”*";
P_HTM[669]="***Through the lack of someone who was preeminent among omniscient Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, buddhist disciples, or sages, the king asked his successive royal questions well deserving to be asked, of a poor naked mendicant who knew nothing and was as blind as a child; and he, being thus asked, giving no proper answer to the question but seizing the opportunity with a “Hear, O king,” declared his own false Dhamma, like one who strikes an ox when it is going along or throws refuse into another’s food-vessel.*";
P_HTM[670]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[671]="***34. “Having heard the Videha king’s words, Kassapa thus replied, “Hear, O king, a true unerring utterance.*";
P_HTM[672]="***35. There is no fruit, good or evil, in following the Dhamma; there is no other world, O king, who has ever come back hither from thence?*";
P_HTM[673]="***36. There are no ancestors, how can there be father or mother? There is no teacher, who will tame what cannot be tamed?*";
P_HTM[674]="***37. All beings are equal and alike, there are none who should receive or pay honour; there is no such thing as strength or courage, how can there be vigour or heroism?All beings are predestined, just as the stern-rope must follow the ship.*";
P_HTM[675]="***38-39. Every mortal gets what he is to get, what then is the use of giving? There is no use, O king, in giving, the giver is helpless and weak; gifts are enjoined by fools and accepted by the wise; weak fools who think themselves wise give to the prudent.”*";
P_HTM[676]="***Having thus described the uselessness of giving, he went on to describe the powerlessness of wrong to produce consequences hereafter:*";
P_HTM[677]="***40-41. “There are seven aggregates indestructible and uninjuring, fire, earth, water, air, pleasure, and pain, and the soul; of these seven there is none that can destroy or divide, nor are they ever to be destroyed; weapons pass harmless amongst these aggregates.*";
P_HTM[678]="***42. He who carries off another’s head with a sharp sword does not divide these aggregates: how then should there be any consequence from evil doing?*";
P_HTM[679]="***43. All beings become pure by passing through eighty-four great aeons; till that period arrives not even the self-restrained becomes pure.*";
P_HTM[680]="***44. Till that period arrives, however much they have followed virtue, they do not become pure, and even if they commit many defilements they do not go beyond that limit.*";
P_HTM[681]="***45. One by one we are purified through the eighty-four great aeons: we cannot go beyond our destiny any more than the sea beyond its shore.’ ”*";
P_HTM[682]="***Thus did the advocate of annihilation enforce his own Dhamma by his vehemence without appealing to any precedent:*";
P_HTM[683]="***46. “Having heard Kassapa’s words, Alāta thus replied, “What you say approves itself also to me. I too remember having gone through a former birth.*";
P_HTM[684]="***47-48. I was a cow-killing huntsman named Piṅgala in a city. Many a wrong did I commit in wealthy Benares, many living creatures I slew, buffaloes, hogs, and goats.*";
P_HTM[685]="***49. Passing from that birth, I was then born in the prosperous family of a general; verily there are no evil consequences for wrongdoing, I did not have to go to hell.”*";
P_HTM[686]="***50-51. Now there happened to be a slave clothed in rags, named Bījaka, who was keeping the fast, and who had come to listen to Guṇa; when he heard Kassapa’s words and Alāta’s reply, he drew many a hot sigh and burst into tears.*";
P_HTM[687]="***52. The Videha king asked him, “Why do you weep? What have you seen or heard? Why do you show me your pain?”*";
P_HTM[688]="***53-55. Bījaka replied, “I have no pain to vex me: listen to me, O king. I too remember my former birth, a happy one; I was one Bhavaseṭṭhi in the city of Sāketa, devoted to virtue, pure, given to alms, and esteemed by brahmins and rich men; and I remember no single evil deed that I committed.*";
P_HTM[689]="***56-58. But when I passed from that life I was conceived in the womb of a poor prostitute, and was born to a miserable life. But miserable as I am I keep my tranquil mind, and I give half of my food to whosoever desires it. I fast every fourteenth and fifteenth day, and I never hurt living creatures, and I abstain from theft.*";
P_HTM[690]="***59-61. But all the good deeds which I do produce no fruit; as Alāta says, I think that virtue is useless. I lose my game in life as an unskilful dice-player; Alāta wins as he has done, just like a skilled player; I see no door by which I may go to heaven; it is for this that I weep when I heard what Kassapa said.”*";
P_HTM[691]="***62-63. Having heard Bījaka’s words, king Aṅgati said: “There is no door to heaven: only wait on destiny. Whether your lot be happiness or misery, it is only gained through destiny: all will at last reach deliverance from transmigration; be not eager for the future.*";
P_HTM[692]="***64. I too have been fortunate in former births and devoted to brahmins and rich men, but while I was busy administering the laws I myself had meanwhile no enjoyment.”*";
P_HTM[693]="***Thus having spoken he took his leave, “O venerable Kassapa, all this long time I have been heedless, but now at last I have found a teacher, and from henceforth, following your teaching, I will take my delight only in pleasure, and not even hearing discourses on virtue shall hinder me. Stay where you are, I will now depart.*";
P_HTM[694]="***65. We may yet see one another again and meet hereafter.”*";
P_HTM[695]="***So saying the king of Videha went to his home.*";
P_HTM[696]="***When the king first visited Guṇa he saluted him respectfully and then asked his question; but when he went away, he went without any salutation: because Guṇa was untrue to his name, through his own unworthiness, he received no salutation, still less did he get alms. So after the night was passed and the next day had come, the king gathered his ministers together and said to them, “Prepare all the elements of enjoyment, henceforth I will only follow the pursuit of pleasure, no other business is to be mentioned before me, let such and such a one carry on the administration of justice,” and he gave himself up accordingly to enjoyment.*";
P_HTM[697]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[698]="***66. When the night turned to day Aṅgati summoned his ministers into his presence and thus addressed them:*";
P_HTM[699]="***67. “In the Candaka palace let them always provide pleasures ready for me, let no one come with messages concerning public or secret matters.*";
P_HTM[700]="***68. Let Vijaya, Sunāma, and the general Alātaka, all three well-skilled in law, sit in judgment on these matters.”*";
P_HTM[701]="***69. So the king, having said this, thought only of pleasure and busied himself no more in the company of brahmins and wealthy men.*";
P_HTM[702]="***70. Then on the fourteenth night the dear daughter of the king, named Rujā, said to her nurse-mother:*";
P_HTM[703]="***71. “Adorn me quickly with my jewels, let my female companions wait on me; tomorrow is the sacred fifteenth day, I will go into the royal presence.”*";
P_HTM[704]="***72-73. They brought her a garland and precious sandalwood, gems, shells, pearls, and precious things and garments of various dyes; and her many attendants, surrounding her as she sat on a golden chair, adorned her, shining in her beauty.*";
P_HTM[705]="***74. Then in the midst of her train, blazing with all kinds of ornaments, Rujā entered the palace Candaka as lightning enters a cloud.*";
P_HTM[706]="***75. Having drawn near the king and saluted him, with all due respect, she sat down on one side on a chair inlaid with gold.*";
P_HTM[707]="***76. The king, when he beheld her surrounded by her train as if a company of Accharā had visited him, thus addressed her:*";
P_HTM[708]="***77. “Do you enjoy yourself in the tank within the precincts of the palace? Do they always bring you all sorts of delicate food?*";
P_HTM[709]="***78. Do you and your maidens gather all kinds of garlands and build bowers for yourselves continually, intent upon sport? Is anything wanting to you?*";
P_HTM[710]="***79. Let them bring it forthwith, ask what you will, impetuous one, even though it be as hard to get as the moon.”*";
P_HTM[711]="***80. Hearing his words Rujā answered her father, “O king, in my lord’s presence every desire of mine is gained.*";
P_HTM[712]="***81. Tomorrow is the sacred fifteenth day, let them bring me a thousand pieces, that I may give it all as a gift to the mendicants.”*";
P_HTM[713]="***82. Hearing Rujā’s words king Aṅgati replied, “Much wealth has been wasted by you idly and without fruit.*";
P_HTM[714]="***83. You keep the Uposathas and neither eat nor drink; this idea of the duty of fasting comes from destiny, there is no merit because you abstain. 84-85. While you live with us, Rujā, put not food away; there is no other world than this, why vex thyself for nought?”*";
P_HTM[715]="***86. Then Rujā bright in her beauty, when she heard his words, thus answered him, knowing as she did the past and the future law:*";
P_HTM[716]="***87. “I have heard in time past and I have seen it with mine own eyes, he who follows children becomes himself a child.*";
P_HTM[717]="***88. The fool who associates with fools plunges deep into folly. It is fitting for Alāta and Bījaka to be deceived.*";
P_HTM[718]="***89. But you are a king full of learning, wise and skilled in the conduct of affairs; how have you fallen into such a low theory, worthy of children?*";
P_HTM[719]="***90. If a man is purified by the mere course of existence, then Guṇa’s own asceticism is useless; like a moth flying into the lighted candle, the idiot has adopted a naked mendicant’s life.*";
P_HTM[720]="***91. Having accepted the idea that all will at last be purified through transmigration, in their great ignorance many corrupt their actions; and being fast caught in the effects of former defilements they find it hard to escape, as the fish from the hook.*";
P_HTM[721]="***92. I will tell you a parable, O king, for your case; the wise sometimes learn the truth by a parable.*";
P_HTM[722]="***93-94. As the ship of the merchants, heavy through taking in too large a cargo, sinks overladen into the sea, so a man, accumulating wrong little by little, sinks overladen into hell.*";
P_HTM[723]="***95-96. Alāta’s present cargo, O king, is not what he is collecting now; for that which he is now taking on board he will hereafter sink to hell. Formerly Alāta’s deeds were righteous, and it is as their result that he enjoys this prosperity.*";
P_HTM[724]="***97. That merit of his is being spent, for he is all intent upon vice; having forsaken the straight road, he is running headlong in a crooked path.*";
P_HTM[725]="***98-99. As the balance properly hung in the weighing-house causes the end to swing up when the weight is put in, so does a man cause his fate at last to rise if he gathers together every piece of merit little by little, like that slave Bījaka intent on merit and thinking too much of heaven.*";
P_HTM[726]="***100-101. In the sorrow which the slave Bījaka now suffers he receives the fruit of defilements which he formerly committed. That wrong is melting away since he is devoted to moral virtue, but let him not enter into Kassapa’s devious paths.”*";
P_HTM[727]="***Then she proceeded to show the evil of practising wrongdoing and the good results of following worthy friends:*";
P_HTM[728]="***102. “Whatever friend a king honours, whether he be good or evil, devoted to vice or to virtue, the king falls into his power.*";
P_HTM[729]="***103. As is the friend whom he chooses for himself and follows, such he himself becomes, such is the power of intimacy.*";
P_HTM[730]="***104. One in constant intercourse affects his fellow, a close comrade his associate, just as a poisoned arrow defiles a pure quiver. Let not the wise become the friend of the wicked for fear of contamination.*";
P_HTM[731]="***105-106. If a man ties up stinking fish with a band of kusa grass, the grass will acquire a putrid smell, so is intimacy with a fool; but if a man binds up myrrh in a common leaf, it will acquire a pleasant odour, so is intimacy with the wise.*";
P_HTM[732]="***107. Therefore, knowing the maturity of his own actions like the ripeness of a basket of fruit, let not the wise man follow the wicked but follow the good, for the wicked lead to hell, while the good bring us to heaven.”*";
P_HTM[733]="***The princess, having discoursed on righteousness in these six verses, declared the sorrows which she had undergone in her past births:*";
P_HTM[734]="***108-109. “I too remember seven births which I have experienced, and when I go from my present life I shall yet pass through seven future ones. My seventh former birth, O king, was as the son of a smith in the city Rājagaha in Magadha.*";
P_HTM[735]="***110. I had an evil companion and I committed much evil; we went about corrupting other men’s wives as if we had been immortal.*";
P_HTM[736]="***111-112. Those actions remained laid up like fire covered with ashes. By the effect of other actions I was born in the land of Vaṁsa in a merchant’s family in Kosambī, great and prosperous and wealthy: I was an only son, continually fostered and honoured.*";
P_HTM[737]="***113. There I followed a friend who was devoted to good works, wise and full of sacred learning, and he grounded me in what was good.*";
P_HTM[738]="***114. I fasted through many a fourteenth and fifteenth night; and that action remained laid up like a treasure in water.*";
P_HTM[739]="***115. But the fruit of the evil deeds which I had done in Magadha came round to me at last like a noxious poison.*";
P_HTM[740]="***116. I passed from thence for a long time, O king, into the Roruva hell, I endured the effects of my own works; when I remember it grieves me still.*";
P_HTM[741]="***117. After spending there a wretched time through a long series of years, I became a castrated goat in Bheṇṇākaṭa.*";
P_HTM[742]="***118. I carried the sons of the wealthy on my back and in a carriage; it was the fated consequence of my going after other men’s wives.*";
P_HTM[743]="***After that I was born in the womb of a monkey in a forest; and on the day of my birth they showed me to the leader of the herd, who exclaimed, ‘Bring my son to me,’ and violently seized my testicles with his teeth and bit them off in spite of my cries.” She explained this in verse.*";
P_HTM[744]="***119. “Passing from this birth, O king, I was born as a monkey in a great forest; I was mutilated by the fierce leader of the herd: this was the fated consequence of my going after other men’s wives.”*";
P_HTM[745]="***Then she went on to describe the other births:*";
P_HTM[746]="***120. “I was next born, O king, as an ox among the Dasaṇṇas, castrated but swift and fair to look at, and I long drew a carriage: this was the fatal consequence of my going after other men’s wives.*";
P_HTM[747]="***121. When I passed from that birth I was born in a family among the Vajjī people but I was neither man nor woman, for it is a very hard thing to attain the being born as a man; this was the fatal consequence of my going after other men’s wives.*";
P_HTM[748]="***122-123. Next, O king, I was born in the Nandana wood, an Accharā of a lovely complexion in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, dressed in garments and ornaments of various hues and wearing jewelled earrings, skilled in dance and song, an attendant in Sakka’s court.*";
P_HTM[749]="***124. While I stayed there I remembered all these births and also the seven future births which I shall experience when I go from hence.*";
P_HTM[750]="***125. The good which I did in Kosambī has come round in its turn, and when I pass from this birth I shall be born only among gods or men.*";
P_HTM[751]="***126. For seven births, O king, I shall be honoured and worshipped, but till the sixth is past I shall not be free from my female sex.*";
P_HTM[752]="***127. But there is my seventh birth, O king, a prosperous Devaputta, I shall be born at last as a male deity in a divine body.*";
P_HTM[753]="***128. Even today they are gathering garlands from the heavenly tree in Nandana, and there is a Devaputta, named Java, who is seeking a garland for me.*";
P_HTM[754]="***129. These sixteen years of my present life are only as one moment in heaven – a hundred mortal autumns are only as one heavenly day and night.*";
P_HTM[755]="***130. Thus do our actions follow us even through countless births, bringing good or evil, no action is ever lost.”*";
P_HTM[756]="***Then she declared the supreme Dhamma:*";
P_HTM[757]="***131. “He who desires to rise continually from birth to birth, let him avoid another’s wife as a man with washed feet the mire.*";
P_HTM[758]="***132. He who desires to rise continually from birth to birth, let him worship the Lord as his attendants worship Sakka.*";
P_HTM[759]="***133. He who wishes for heavenly enjoyments, a heavenly life, glory, and happiness, let him avoid defilements and follow the threefold law.*";
P_HTM[760]="***134. Watchful and wise in body, word and thought, he follows his own highest good, be he born as a woman or a man.*";
P_HTM[761]="***135. Whosoever are born glorious in the world and nursed in all pleasures, without doubt in former time they had lived a virtuous life; all beings separately abide by their own deserts.*";
P_HTM[762]="***136. Do you thyself think, O king, what caused you to own these wives of thine like Accharā, beautifully adorned and dressed with golden nets?”*";
P_HTM[763]="***Thus she counselled her father.*";
P_HTM[764]="***The Teacher thus explained the matter:*";
P_HTM[765]="***137. “Thus did the maiden Rujā please her father, she taught the bewildered one the true road, and devoutly declared to him the Dhamma.”*";
P_HTM[766]="***Having proclaimed the Dhamma to her father all night from early morning, she said to him, “O king, listen not to the words of a naked heretic, but receive the words of some good friend like me, who tells you that there is this world and there is another world, and that there are fated consequences to every good or evil action, rush not on by a wrong road.” Still she was not able to deliver her father from his false Dhamma: he was only pleased when he heard her sweet words, for all parents naturally love their dear children’s speech, but they do not give up their old opinions.*";
P_HTM[767]="***So too there arose a stir in the city, “The king’s daughter Rujā is trying to drive away heretical views by teaching the Dhamma,” and the multitude were well-pleased, “The wise princess will set him free from false teaching today and will inaugurate prosperity for the citizens.” But though she could not make her father understand she did not lose heart, but resolving that by some means or other she would bring her father true happiness, she placed her joined hands on her head and after having made her obeisance in the ten directions, she offered worship, saying: “In this world there are righteous ascetics and brahmins who support the world, there are the presiding deities, there are the great Brahmā deities, let them come and cause my father to give up his heresy; and if they have no power in themselves, then let them come by my power and virtue and drive away this heresy and bring about the welfare of the whole world.”*";
P_HTM[768]="***Now the Mahābrahmā of that time was a Bodhisatta named Nārada; and the Bodhisattas in their mercy, compassion, and sovereignty, cast their eyes over the world from time to time to behold the righteous and the wicked beings. As he was that day looking over the world he saw the princess worshipping the presiding deities in her desire to deliver her father from heresy, and he thought to himself: “Except me, none other can drive away false teaching, I must come today and show kindness to the princess and bring happiness to the king and his people. In what garb shall I go? Ascetics are dear and venerable to men and their words are counted worthy to be received; I will go in the garb of an ascetic.”*";
P_HTM[769]="***So he assumed a pleasing human form, having a complexion like gold, with his hair matted and a golden needle thrust into the tangle; and having put on a tattered dress red outside and within, and having hung over one shoulder a black antelope’s hide made of silver and decorated with golden stars, and having taken a golden begging bowl hung with a string of pearls, and having laid on his shoulders a golden carrying pole curved in three places, and taken up a coral waterpot by a string of pearls, he went with this garb through the heavens shining like the moon in the firmament, and having entered the terrace of the Canda palace he stood in the sky in front of the king.*";
P_HTM[770]="***The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[771]="***138. “Then Nārada came down to men from the Brahmā Realm, and surveying Jambudīpa he beheld king Aṅgati.*";
P_HTM[772]="***139. Then he stood on the palace before the king, and Rujā, having beheld him, saluted the divine sage who had come.”*";
P_HTM[773]="***Then the king, being rebuked by the Brahmā’s glory, could not remain on his throne, but came down and stood on the ground and asked him the cause of his coming and his name and family.*";
P_HTM[774]="***The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[775]="***140. Then the king, alarmed in his mind, having come down from his seat spoke thus to Nārada, making his inquiries:*";
P_HTM[776]="***141. “Whence come you, of heavenly aspect, like the moon illumining the night; tell me in answer your name and family, how do they call you in the world of men?”*";
P_HTM[777]="***Then he thought to himself, “This king does not believe in another world, I will tell him about another world,” so he uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[778]="***142. “I come now from the gods like the moon illumining the night, I tell you my name and family as you ask: they know me as Nārada and Kassapa.”*";
P_HTM[779]="***Then the king thought to himself, “By and by I will ask him about another world; I will now ask him as to the purpose of these Supernormal Powers.”*";
P_HTM[780]="***143. “In that you go and stand in this marvellous fashion, I ask you, O Nārada, what does it mean; for what reason is this miracle wrought?”*";
P_HTM[781]="***Nārada replied:*";
P_HTM[782]="***144. “Truth, righteousness, self-command, and liberality, these were in old days my notorious virtues; by these same virtues diligently followed I go swift as thought wherever I desire.”*";
P_HTM[783]="***Even while he was thus speaking the king, unable to believe in another world from the perverseness of his evil doctrines, exclaimed, “Is there such a thing as recompense for good actions?” and repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[784]="***145. “You utter a marvel when you talk of the might brought by good actions; if these things are as you say, Nārada, this question, being asked, do you answer me truly.”*";
P_HTM[785]="***Nārada replied:*";
P_HTM[786]="***146. “Ask me, O king; this is your business; this doubt of thine which you feel, I will assuredly solve it for you by reasoning, by logic, and by proofs.”*";
P_HTM[787]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[788]="***147. “I ask you this matter, O Nārada; give me not a false answer to my question; are there really Devas or Petas, is there another world as people say?”*";
P_HTM[789]="***Nārada answered:*";
P_HTM[790]="***148. “There are indeed Devas and Petas, there is another world as people say; but men being greedy and infatuated with pleasure know not of another world in their delusion.”*";
P_HTM[791]="***When the king heard this he laughed and uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[792]="***149. “If you believe, Nārada, that there is in another world a dwelling-place for the dead, then give me here five hundred pieces, and I will give you a thousand in the next world.”*";
P_HTM[793]="***Then the Great Being replied, reproving him in the midst of the assembly:*";
P_HTM[794]="***150. “I would give you the five hundred if I knew that you were virtuous and generous; but who would press you for the thousand in the next world, if you, the merciless one, were dwelling in hell?*";
P_HTM[795]="***151. Here when a man is averse to virtue, a lover of wrong, idle, and cruel, wise men do not entrust a loan to him: there is no return from such a debtor.*";
P_HTM[796]="***152. When men know that another is skilful, active, virtuous and generous, they invite him to borrow by the advantages they hold out; when he has done his business, he will bring back what he has borrowed.”*";
P_HTM[797]="***The king, thus rebuked, was not ready with an answer.*";
P_HTM[798]="***The multitude, being delighted, shouted, “O princess, you are a being of miraculous power, you will deliver the king this day from his false doctrines,” and the whole city was filled with excitement. Then by the power of the Great Being there was not a person within the range of the seven leagues over which Mithilā extends who did not hear his teaching of the Dhamma. Then the Great Being reflected: “This king has grasped his false doctrines very firmly; I will frighten him with the fear of hell and make him give them up, and then I will comfort him with some heaven of the gods,” so he said to him, “O king, if you do not give up these doctrines, you will go to hell with its endless torments,” and he began to give an account of the different hells:*";
P_HTM[799]="***153. “When you go hence you will see yourself dragged by flocks of ravens and devoured by them as you live in hell, and by crows, vultures, and hawks, with your body torn and dripping blood: who would press you for a thousand pieces in the next world?”*";
P_HTM[800]="***Having described the raven hell, he said: “If you do not dwell there, you will dwell in a hell in the space between three spheres,” and he uttered a verse to describe it:*";
P_HTM[801]="***154. “Blind darkness is there, and no moon or sun, a hell evermore tumultuous and dreadful; it is not known as either night or day: who would wander seeking money in such a place?”*";
P_HTM[802]="***Then having described that intermediate hell at full length, he said: “O king, if you abandon not your false doctrines, you will suffer not only this but other torments as well,” and he uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[803]="***155. “Two dogs Sabala and Sāma of giant size, mighty and strong, devour with their iron teeth him who is driven hence and goes to another world.”*";
P_HTM[804]="***A similar rule applies to the subsequent hells; therefore all these worlds, together with their guardians, are to be described in a pregnant prose version of the various verses as in the preceding narrative.*";
P_HTM[805]="***156. “As he lives in hell thus devoured by cruel beasts of torture, with his body torn and dripping blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[806]="***157. With arrows and well-sharpened spears the Kāḷūpakāḷas as enemies smite and wound him in hell who before committed evil.*";
P_HTM[807]="***158. As he wanders in hell thus smitten in belly and side, and with his entrails mangled, his body torn and dripping blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[808]="***159. Heaven rains down these spears, arrows, javelins and spikes and various weapons, flames fall like burning coals, it rains missiles of rock on the cruel man.*";
P_HTM[809]="***160. An intolerable hot wind blows in hell, not even a transient pleasure is felt there; rushing about, sick, with no refuge, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[810]="***161. Hurrying along yoked in chariots, treading along the fiery ground, urged on with goads and sticks, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[811]="***162. As he climbs a fearful blazing mountain studded with razors, his body gashed and dripping with blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[812]="***163. As he climbs a dreadful blazing heap of burning coals like a mountain, with his body all burned, and miserable, and weeping, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[813]="***164-165. There are lofty thickets like heaps of clouds, full of thorns, with sharp iron spikes which drink the blood of men, women and men who go after other people’s wives have to climb it, driven on by the servants of Yama bearing spears in their hands.*";
P_HTM[814]="***166-167. As he climbs the infernal silk-cotton tree all covered with blood, his body gashed and flayed, sick and racked with pain, panting with deep hot sighs and thus expiating his former crimes, who would ask him for his old debt?*";
P_HTM[815]="***168-169. There are lofty forests like heaps of clouds, covered with swords for leaves, armed with iron knives which drink the blood of men; as he climbs the tree with iron leaves, cut with sharp swords, his body gashed and dripping blood, who would press him for the thousand pieces in the next world?*";
P_HTM[816]="***170. When he escapes from that hell of iron leaves and falls into the river Vetaraṇī, who would ask him for his old debt?*";
P_HTM[817]="***171-172. On flows the river Vetaranī, cruel with boiling water and covered with iron lotuses and sharp leaves; as he is hurried along covered with blood and with his limbs all cut, in the stream of Vetaranī where there is nothing to rest upon, who would ask him for his debt?”*";
P_HTM[818]="***When the king heard this description of hell from the Great Being, bewildered in heart and seeking a refuge, he thus addressed him:*";
P_HTM[819]="***173. “I tremble like a tree which is being cut down; confused in mind, I know not which way to turn; I am tormented with terror, great is my fear, when I hear these verses uttered by you.*";
P_HTM[820]="***174. As when a thing burning is plunged in the water, or like an island in a stormy ocean, or like a lamp in the darkness, you are my refuge, O sage.*";
P_HTM[821]="***175. Teach me, O seer, the sacred text and its meaning; verily the past has been a wrong course; teach me, Nārada, the path of purity, so that I may not fall into hell.”*";
P_HTM[822]="***Then the Great Being to teach him the path of purity told him by way of example of various former kings who had followed righteousness:*";
P_HTM[823]="***176-177. “Dhataraṭṭha, Vessāmitta and Aṭṭhaka, Yāmataggi and Usinnara and king Sivi, these and other kings, waiting diligently on brahmins and ascetics, all went to Sakka’s heaven; do you, O king, avoid unrighteousness and follow righteousness.*";
P_HTM[824]="***178. Let them proclaim in your palace, bearing food in their hands, ‘Who is hungry or thirsty? Who wants a garland or ointment? What naked man would put on garments decked with various jewels?*";
P_HTM[825]="***179. Who would take an umbrella for his journey, and soft delicate shoes?’ Thus let them proclaim aloud in your city evening and morning.*";
P_HTM[826]="***180. Put not to labour the aged man nor the aged ox and horse: give to each the due honour still; when he was strong he fulfilled his position of trust.”*";
P_HTM[827]="***Thus the Great Being, having discoursed to him concerning liberality and good conduct, seeing that the king would be pleased at being compared to a chariot, proceeded to instruct him in the Dhamma under the figure of a chariot which brings every desire:*";
P_HTM[828]="***181-182. “Your body is called a chariot, swift and provided with the mind as a charioteer: having the abstinence from all injury as its axle, liberality as its covering, a careful walk with the feet as the circumference of the wheel, a careful handling with the hands as the side of the carriage; watchfulness over the belly is the name of the wheel, watchfulness over the tongue is the prevention of the wheel’s rattling.*";
P_HTM[829]="***183. Its parts are all complete through truthful speech, it is well fastened together by the absence of slander, its frame is all smooth with friendly words and joined well with well-measured speech.*";
P_HTM[830]="***184. Well-constructed with faith and the absence of covetousness, with the respectful salutation of humility as the carriage-pole, with the shaft of gentleness and meekness, with the rope of self-restraint, according to the Five Precepts.*";
P_HTM[831]="***185-186. Steady in the absence of anger, and the white umbrella of righteousness, driven with a thorough knowledge of the proper seasons, having the three sticks prepared in his assured confidence, having humble speech as the thong, and with the absence of vain-glory as the yoke, with the cushion of unattached thoughts.*";
P_HTM[832]="***187. Following wisdom and free from dust, let memory be your goad, and the ready application of firmness your reins.*";
P_HTM[833]="***188. Mind pursues the path of self-control with its steeds all equally trained, desire and lust are an evil path, but self-control is the straight road.*";
P_HTM[834]="***189. As the steed rushes along after forms and sounds and smells, intellect uses the scourge and the self is the charioteer.*";
P_HTM[835]="***190. If one goes with his chariot, if this calmness and firmness be steadfast, he will attain all desires, O king, he will never go to hell.”*";
P_HTM[836]="***“Thus, O king, I have described to you in various ways that path to happiness which I begged Nārada to tell me so that I might not fall into hell.”Having thus instructed him in the Dhamma and taken away his false doctrines, and established him in the moral precepts, he commanded him henceforth to eschew evil friends and to follow virtuous friends and to take heed how he walked; then he praised the virtues of the princess and exhorted the royal court and the royal wives, and then passed in their sight to the Brahmā Realm with great majesty.*";
P_HTM[837]="***The Teacher, having ended his lesson, exclaimed, “Not only now, but formerly also, monks, I converted Uruvelā Kassapa and cut the net of heresy which bound him,” so saying, he identified the Jātaka, and uttered these verses at the end,*";
P_HTM[838]="***191. “Devadatta was Alāta, Bhaddaji was Sunāma,*";
P_HTM[839]="***Sāriputta was Vijaya, Mogallāna was Bījaka,*";
P_HTM[840]="***192. The Licchavi prince Sunakkhatta was the naked ascetic Guṇa;*";
P_HTM[841]="***Ānanda was Rujā who converted the king,*";
P_HTM[842]="***193. And Uruvelā Kassapa the king who held false doctrines,*";
P_HTM[843]="***and the Bodhisatta was the great Brahmā; thus you have the story of the birth.”*";
P_HTM[844]="* 8. Mahānāradakassapajātakavaṇṇanā** The Story about (the Wise) Vidhura (Mahānipāta)*";
P_HTM[845]="***“You are pale and thin and weak.” The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Wisdom.*";
P_HTM[846]="***One day the monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: “Venerable sirs, the Teacher has great and wide wisdom, he is ready and quick-witted, he is sharp and keen-witted and able to crush the arguments of his opponents, by the power of his wisdom he overthrows the subtle questions propounded by noble sages and reduces them to silence, and having established them in the three refuges and the moral precepts, causes them to enter on the path which leads to immortality.”*";
P_HTM[847]="***The Teacher came and asked what was the topic which the monks were debating as they sat together; and on hearing what it was he said: “It is not wonderful, monks, that the Tathāgata, having attained the Perfection of Wisdom, should overthrow the arguments of his opponents and convert nobles and others. For in the earlier ages, when he was still seeking for supreme knowledge, he was wise and able to crush the arguments of his opponents. Yea verily in the time of Vidhurakumāra, on the summit of the Black Mountain which is sixty leagues in height, by the force of my wisdom I converted the Yakkha general, Puṇṇaka, and reduced him to silence and made him give his own life as a gift,” and so saying he told a story of the past.*";
P_HTM[848]="***The Section about the Fourfold Fast*";
P_HTM[849]="***In the past in the Kuru kingdom in the city of Indapatta a king ruled named Dhanañjayakoravya. He had a minister named the wise Vidhura who gave his instructions concerning temporal and spiritual matters; and having a sweet tongue and great eloquence in discoursing on the Dhamma, he bewitched all the kings of Jambudīpa by his sweet discourses concerning the Dhamma as elephants are fascinated by a favourite lute. Nor did he suffer them to depart to their own kingdoms, but dwelt in that city in great glory, teaching the Dhamma to the people with all the power of a Buddha.*";
P_HTM[850]="***Now there were four rich brahmin householders in Benares, friends, who, having seen the misery of desires, went into the Himālayas and embraced the ascetic life, and having entered upon the Super Knowledges and Attainments, continued to dwell a long time there, feeding on the forest roots and fruits, and then, as they went their rounds to procure salt and sour condiments, came to beg in the city Kālacampā in the kingdom of Aṅga.*";
P_HTM[851]="***There four householders who were friends, being pleased with their behaviour, having paid them respect and taken their begging vessels, waited upon then with choice food, each in his own house, and taking their promise arranged a home for them in their garden. So the four ascetics having taken their food in the houses of the four householders, went away to pass the day, one going to the heaven of the Thirty-Three, another to the world of the Nāgas, another to the world of the Supaṇṇas, and the fourth to the park Migācira belonging to the Koravya king.*";
P_HTM[852]="***Now he who spent his day in the world of the gods, after beholding Sakka’s glory, described it in full to his attendant, and so too did he who spent his day in the Nāga and Supaṇṇa world, and so too he who spent his day in the park of the Koravya king Dhanañjaya; each described in full the glory of that respective king.*";
P_HTM[853]="***So these four attendants desired these heavenly abodes, and having performed gifts and other works of merit, at the end of their lives, one was born as Sakka, another was born with a wife and child in the Nāga world, another was born as the Supaṇṇa king in the palace of the Simbali lake, and the fourth was conceived by the chief queen of king Dhanañjaya; while the four ascetics were reborn in the Brahmā Realm.*";
P_HTM[854]="***The Koravya prince grew up, and on his father’s death assumed his kingdom and ruled in righteousness, but he was famed for his skill in dice. He listened to the instruction of the wise Vidhura and gave alms and kept the moral law and observed the fast. One day when he had undertaken the fast, he went into the garden, determining to practise pious meditation, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, he performed the duties of an ascetic. Sakka also, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the world of the gods, so he went into that very garden in the world of men, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, performed the duties of an ascetic. Varuṇa also, the Nāga king, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the Nāga world, so he went into that same garden, and, having seated himself in a pleasant place, performed the duties of an ascetic. The Supaṇṇa king also, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the Supaṇṇa world, so he went into that same garden, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, performed the duties of an ascetic.*";
P_HTM[855]="***Then these four, having risen from their places at evening time, as they stood on the bank of the royal lake, came together and looked at one another, and, being filled with their old kindly affection, they awakened their former friendship and sat down with a pleasant greeting. Sakka sat down on a royal seat, and the others seated themselves as befitted the dignity of each.*";
P_HTM[856]="***Then Sakka said to them, “We are all four kings, now what is the preeminent virtue of each?” Then Varuṇa the Nāga king replied, “My virtue is superior to that of you three,” and when they inquired why, he said: “This Supaṇṇa king is our enemy, whether before or after we are born, yet even when I see him, such a destructive enemy of our race, I never feel any anger; therefore my virtue is superior,” and he then uttered the first verse of the Catuposathajātaka [Ja 441]:*";
P_HTM[857]="***1. “The good man who feels no anger towards one who merits anger and who never lets anger arise within him, he who even when angered does not allow it to be seen, him they indeed call an ascetic.*";
P_HTM[858]="***These are my qualities; therefore my virtue is superior.”*";
P_HTM[859]="***The Supaṇṇa king, hearing this, said: “This Nāga is my chief food; but since, even though I see such food at hand, I endure my hunger and do not commit evil for the sake of food, my virtue is superior,” and he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[860]="***2. “He who bears hunger with a pinched belly, a self-restrained ascetic who eats and drinks by rule, and commits no evil for the sake of food, him they indeed call an ascetic.”*";
P_HTM[861]="***Then Sakka the King of the Devas said: “I left behind various kinds of heavenly glory, all immediate sources of happiness, and came to the world of mankind in order to maintain my virtue, therefore my virtue is superior,” and he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[862]="***3. “Having abandoned all sport and pleasure, he utters no false word in the world, he is averse to all outward pomp and carnal desire, such a man they indeed call an ascetic.”*";
P_HTM[863]="***Thus did Sakka describe his own virtue.*";
P_HTM[864]="***Then king Dhanañjaya said: “I today have abandoned my court and my harem with sixteen thousand dancing girls, and I practise an ascetic’s duties in a garden; therefore my virtue is superior,” and he added this verse:*";
P_HTM[865]="***4. “Those who with full knowledge abandon all that they call their own and all the workings of lust, he who is self-restrained, resolute, unselfish, and free from desire, him they indeed call an ascetic.” Thus they each declared their own virtue as superior, and then they asked Dhanañjaya, “O king, is there any wise man in your court who could solve this doubt?” “Yes, O kings, I have the wise Vidhura, who fills a post of unequalled responsibility and declares civil and ecclesiastical law, he will solve our doubt, we will go to him.” They at once consented. So they all went out of the garden and proceeded to the hall for monastic assemblies, and, having ordered it to be adorned, they seated the Bodhisatta on a high seat, and, having offered him a friendly greeting, sat down on one side and said: “O wise sir! A doubt has risen in our minds, do you solve it for us:*";
P_HTM[866]="***5. We ask you the minister of lofty wisdom: a dispute has arisen in our utterances, do you consider and solve our perplexities today, let us through you today escape from our doubt.”*";
P_HTM[867]="***The wise man, having heard their words, replied, “O kings, how shall I know what you said well or ill concerning your virtue, as you uttered the verses in your dispute?” and he added this verse:*";
P_HTM[868]="***6. “Those wise men who know the real state of things and who speak wisely at the proper time, how shall they, however wise, draw out the meaning of verses which have not been uttered to them?*";
P_HTM[869]="***7. How does the Nāga king speak, how Garuḷa, the son of Vinatā? Or what says the king of the Gandhabbas? Or how speaks the most noble king of the Kurus?”*";
P_HTM[870]="***Then they uttered this verse to him:*";
P_HTM[871]="***8. “The Nāga king preaches forbearance, Garuḷa the son of Vinatā gentleness, the king of the Gandhabbas abstinence from carnal lust, and the most noble king of the Kurus freedom from all hindrances.”*";
P_HTM[872]="***Then the Great Being, having heard their words, uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[873]="***9. “All these sayings are well spoken, there is nothing here uttered amiss; and he in whom these are properly fitted like the spokes in the nave of a wheel, he, who is endowed with these four virtues, is called an ascetic indeed.”*";
P_HTM[874]="***Thus the Great Being declared the virtue of each of them to be one and the same. Then the four, when they heard him, were well pleased, and uttered this verse in his praise:*";
P_HTM[875]="***10. “You are the best, you are incomparable, you are wise, a guardian and knower of the Dhamma: having grasped the problem by your wisdom, you cut the doubts in your skill as the ivory-workman the ivory with his saw.”*";
P_HTM[876]="***Thus all the four were pleased with his explanation of their question. Then Sakka rewarded him with a robe of heavenly silk, Garuḷa with a golden garland, Varuṇa the Nāga king with a jewel, and king Dhanañjaya with a thousand cows, etc.; then Dhanañjaya addressed him in this verse:*";
P_HTM[877]="***11. “I give you a thousand cows and a bull and an elephant, and these ten chariots drawn with thoroughbred horses, and sixteen excellent villages, being well pleased with your solution of the question.” Then Sakka and the rest, having paid all honour to the Great Being, departed to their own abodes.*";
P_HTM[878]="***The Longing during Pregnancy*";
P_HTM[879]="***Now the queen of the Nāga king was the lady Vimalā; and when she saw that no jewelled ornament was on his neck, she asked him where it was. He replied, “I was pleased at hearing the moral discourse of the wise Vidhura the son of the brahmin Canda, and I presented the jewel to him, and not only I, but Sakka honoured him with a robe of heavenly silk, the Supaṇṇa king gave him a golden garland, and king Dhanañjaya a thousand oxen and many other things besides.” “He is, I suppose, eloquent in the Dhamma.” “Lady, what are you talking about? It is as if a Buddha had appeared in Jambudīpa! A hundred kings in all Jambudīpa, being caught in his sweet words, do not return to their own kingdoms, but remain like wild elephants fascinated by the sound of their favourite lute, this is the character of his eloquence!” When she heard the account of his preeminence she longed to hear him discourse on the Dhamma, and she thought in herself, “If I tell the king that I long to hear him discourse on the Dhamma, and ask him to bring him here, he will not bring him to me; what if I were to pretend to be ill and complained of a sick woman’s longing?” So she gave a sign to her attendants and took to her bed. When the king did not see her when he paid his visit to her, he asked the attendants where Vimalā was. They replied that she was sick, and when he went to see her he sat on the side of her bed and rubbed her body as he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[880]="***12. “Pale and thin and weak, your colour and form was not like this before, O Vimalā, answer my question, what is this pain of the body which has come upon you?”*";
P_HTM[881]="***She told him in the following:*";
P_HTM[882]="***13. “There is an affection in women, it is called a longing, O king; O monarch of the Nāgas, I desire Vidhura’s heart brought here without guile.”*";
P_HTM[883]="***He replied to her:*";
P_HTM[884]="***14. “You long for the moon or the sun or the wind; the very sight of Vidhura is hard to get: who will be able to bring him here?”*";
P_HTM[885]="***When she heard his words, she exclaimed, “I shall die if I do not obtain it,” so she turned round in her bed and showed her back and covered her face with the end of her robe. The Nāga king went to his own chamber and sat on his bed and pondered how bent Vimalā was on obtaining Vidhura’s heart, “She will die if she does not obtain the flesh of his heart; how can I get it for her?”*";
P_HTM[886]="***Now his daughter Irandatī, a Nāga princess, came in all her beauty and ornaments to pay her respects to her father, and, having saluted him, she stood on one side. She saw that his countenance was troubled, and she said to him, “You are greatly distressed, what is the reason?”*";
P_HTM[887]="***15. “O father, why are you full of care, why is your face like a lotus plucked by the hand? Why are you woe-begone, O king? Do not grieve, O conqueror of enemies.”*";
P_HTM[888]="***Hearing his daughter’s words, the Nāga king answered:*";
P_HTM[889]="***16. “Your mother, O Irandatī, desires Vidhura’s heart, the very sight of Vidhura is hard to get, who will be able to bring him here?”*";
P_HTM[890]="***Then he said to her:*";
P_HTM[891]="***17. “Daughter, there is no one in my court who can bring Vidhura here; do you give life to your mother, and seek out some husband who can bring Vidhura.”*";
P_HTM[892]="***So he dismissed her with a half-verse, suggesting improper thoughts to his daughter:*";
P_HTM[893]="***18. “Seek you for a husband, who shall bring Vidhura here.” And when she heard her father’s words, she went forth in the night and gave free course to her passionate desire.*";
P_HTM[894]="***As she went she gathered all the flowers in the Himālayas which had colour, scent, or taste, and, having adorned the entire mountain like a precious jewel, she spread a couch of flowers upon it, and, having executed a pleasant dance, she sang a sweet song:*";
P_HTM[895]="***19. “What Gandhabba or Rakkhasa, what Nāga, Kimpurisa or man, or what sage, able to grant all desires, will be my husband the livelong night?”*";
P_HTM[896]="***Now at that time the nephew of the great king Vessavaṇa, named Puṇṇaka, the Yakkha general, as he was riding on a magic Sindh horse, three leagues in length, and hastening over the red arsenic surface of the Black Mountain to a gathering of the Yakkhas, heard that song of hers, and the voice of the woman which he had heard in his last previous life pierced his skin and nerves and penetrated to his very bones; and, being fascinated by it, he turned back, seated as he was on his Sindh horse, and thus addressed her, comforting her, “O lady, I can bring you Vidhura’s heart by my knowledge, holiness, and calmness, do not be anxious about it,” and he added this verse:*";
P_HTM[897]="***20. “Be comforted, I will be your husband, I will be your husband, O you of faultless eyes: verily my knowledge is such, be comforted, you shall be my wife.”*";
P_HTM[898]="***21. Then Irandatī answered, with her thoughts following the old experience of a wooing in a former birth, “Come, let us go to my father, he will explain this matter to you.”*";
P_HTM[899]="***22. Adorned, clad in bright raiment, wearing garlands, and anointed with sandal, she seized the Yakkha by the hand and went into her father’s presence.*";
P_HTM[900]="***And Puṇṇaka, having taken her back, went to her father the Nāga king and asked for her as his wife:*";
P_HTM[901]="***23. “O Nāga chief, hear my words, receive a fitting present for your daughter; I ask for Irandatī: give her to me as my possession.*";
P_HTM[902]="***24. A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, a hundred mules and chariots, a hundred complete wagons filled with all sorts of gems, take you all these, O Nāga king, and give me your daughter Irandatī.”*";
P_HTM[903]="***Then the Nāga king replied:*";
P_HTM[904]="***25. “Wait while I consult my kinsmen, my friends, and acquaintances; a business done without consultation leads afterwards to regret.”*";
P_HTM[905]="***26. Then the Nāga king, having entered his palace, spoke these words as he consulted his wife,*";
P_HTM[906]="***27. “This Puṇṇaka the Yakkha asks me for Irandatī; shall we give her to him in exchange for much wealth?”*";
P_HTM[907]="***Vimalā answered:*";
P_HTM[908]="***28. “Our Irandatī is not to be won by wealth or treasure; if he obtains by his own worth and brings here the sage’s heart, the princess shall be won by that wealth, we ask no further treasure.”*";
P_HTM[909]="***29. Then the Nāga Varuṇa went out from his palace, and, consulting with Puṇṇaka, thus addressed him:*";
P_HTM[910]="***30. “Our Irandatī is not to be won by wealth or treasure; if you obtained by your own worth and bring here the sage’s heart, the princess shall be won by that wealth, we ask no further treasure.”*";
P_HTM[911]="***Puṇṇaka replied:*";
P_HTM[912]="***31. “Him whom some people call a sage, others will call a fool; tell me, for they utter different opinions about the matter, who is he whom you callest a sage, O Nāga?”*";
P_HTM[913]="***The Nāga king answered:*";
P_HTM[914]="***32. “If you have heard of Vidhura the minister of the Koravya king Dhanañjaya, bring that sage here, and let Irandatī be your lawful wife.”*";
P_HTM[915]="***33. Hearing these words of Varuṇa, the Yakkha sprang up greatly pleased; just as he was, he said at once to his attendant, “Bring me here my thoroughbred ready harnessed.”*";
P_HTM[916]="***34. With ears of gold and hoofs of ruby, and mail-armour of molten gold.*";
P_HTM[917]="***The man brought the Sindh horse thus caparisoned; and Puṇṇaka, having mounted him, went through the sky to Vessavaṇa and told him of the adventure, thus describing the Nāga world; this is described as follows:*";
P_HTM[918]="***35. “Puṇṇaka, having mounted his horse, a charger fit for bearing the gods, himself richly adorned and with his beard and hair trimmed, went through the sky.*";
P_HTM[919]="***36. Puṇṇaka, greedy with the passion of desire, longing to win the Nāga maiden Irandatī, having gone to the glorious king, thus addressed Vessavaṇa Kuvera:*";
P_HTM[920]="***37. “There is the palace Bhogavatī called the Golden Home, the capital of the snake kingdom erected in its golden city.*";
P_HTM[921]="***38. Watch-towers which mimic lips and necks, with rubies and cat’s eye jewels, palaces built of marble and rich with gold, and covered with jewels inlaid with gold. 39. Mangoes, tilaka trees and Jambu plums, sattapaṇṇas, mucalindas and ketakas, piyakas, uddālakas and sahas, and sinduvāritas with their wealth of blossom above,*";
P_HTM[922]="***40. Champacs, Nāgamālikās, bhaginīmālās, and jujube trees, all these different trees bending with their boughs, lend their beauty to the Nāga palace.*";
P_HTM[923]="***41. There is a huge date palm made of precious stones with golden blossoms that fade not, and there dwells the Nāga king Varuṇa, endowed with magical powers and born of supernatural birth.*";
P_HTM[924]="***42. There dwells his queen Vimalā with a body like a golden creeper, tall like a young kālā plant, fair to see with her breasts like nimba fruits.*";
P_HTM[925]="***43. Fair-skinned and painted with lac dye, like a kaṇikāra tree blossoming in a sheltered spot, like an Accharā dwelling in the Deva world, like lightning flashing from a thick cloud.*";
P_HTM[926]="***44. Bewildered and full of a strange longing, she desires Vidhura’s heart. I will give it to them, O king, and they will give me Irandatī.”*";
P_HTM[927]="***As he dared not go without Vessavaṇa’s permission, he repeated these verses to inform him about it. But Vessavaṇa did not listen to him, as he was busy settling some dispute about a palace between two Devaputtas. Puṇṇaka, knowing that his words were not listened to, remained near that one of the two disputants who proved victorious in the contest. Vessavaṇa, having decided the dispute, took no thought of the defeated candidate, but said to the other, “Go you and dwell in your palace.” Directly the words were said “go you,” Puṇṇaka called some Devaputtas as witnesses, saying: “You see that I am sent by my uncle,” and at once ordered his steed to be brought and mounted it and set out.*";
P_HTM[928]="***The Teacher thus described what took place:*";
P_HTM[929]="***45. “Puṇṇaka, having bidden farewell to Vessavaṇa the glorious lord of beings, thus gave his command to his servant standing there, ‘Bring hither my thoroughbred harnessed.’*";
P_HTM[930]="***46. With ears of gold, hoofs of ruby, and mail-armour of molten gold.*";
P_HTM[931]="***47. Puṇṇaka, having mounted the god-bearing steed, well-adorned and with his beard and hair well-trimmed, went through space in the sky.”*";
P_HTM[932]="***As he went through the air he pondered, “The wise Vidhura has a great retinue and he cannot be taken by force, but Dhanañjaya Koravya is renowned for his skill in gambling. I will conquer him in play and so seize the wise Vidhura. Now there are many jewels in his house: he will not play for any poor sum; I shall have to bring a jewel of great value, the king will not accept a common jewel. Now there is a precious jewel of price belonging to the Universal Monarch, in the Vepulla Mountain near the city Rājagaha; I will take that and entice the king to play and so conquer him.” He did so.*";
P_HTM[933]="***The Teacher declared the whole story:*";
P_HTM[934]="***48. “He went to pleasant Rājagaha, the far-off city of Aṅga, rich in provisions and abounding with food and drink. Like Masakkasāra, Sakka’s capital.*";
P_HTM[935]="***49. Filled with the notes of peacocks and herons, resonant, full of beautiful courts, and with every kind of bird like the mountain Himavat covered with flowers.*";
P_HTM[936]="***50. So Puṇṇaka climbed Mount Vepulla, with its heaps of rocks inhabited by Kimpurisas, seeking for the glorious jewel, and at last he saw it in the middle of the mountain.*";
P_HTM[937]="***51-52. When he saw the glorious precious gem thus flashing light, gleaming so splendidly with its beauty, shining like lightning in the sky, he at once seized the precious lapis lazuli, the jewel of priceless value, and mounted on his peerless steed, himself of noble beauty, he rushed through space in the sky.*";
P_HTM[938]="***53. He went to the city Indapatta, and he alighted in the court of the Kurus; the fearless Yakkha summoned the hundred warriors who were gathered there.*";
P_HTM[939]="***54. ‘Who wishes to conquer from us the prize of kings? Or whom shall we conquer in the contest of worth? What peerless jewel shall we win? Or who shall win our best of treasures?’ ”*";
P_HTM[940]="***Thus in four lines he praised Koravya. Then the king thought to himself, “I have never before seen a hero like this who uttered such words; who can it be?” and he asked him in this verse:*";
P_HTM[941]="***55. “In what kingdom is your birthplace? These are not the words of a Koravya: you surpass us all in your form and appearance; tell me your name and kindred.”*";
P_HTM[942]="***The other reflected: “This king asks my name: now it is the servant Puṇṇaka; but if I tell him that I am Puṇṇaka, he will say, ‘He is a servant, why does he speak to me so audaciously?’ and he will despise me; I will tell him my name in my last past birth.” So he uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[943]="***56. “I am a youth named Kaccāyana, O king; they call me one of no mean name; my kindred and friends are in Aṅga; I have come here for the sake of play.”*";
P_HTM[944]="***Then the king asked him, “What will you give if you are conquered in play? what have you got?” and he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[945]="***57. “What jewels has the youth, which the gamester who conquers him may win? A king has many jewels, how can you, a poor man, challenge them?”*";
P_HTM[946]="***Then Puṇṇaka answered:*";
P_HTM[947]="***58. “This is a fascinating jewel of mine, it is a glorious jewel which brings wealth; and the gamester who conquers me shall win this peerless steed which plagues all enemies.”*";
P_HTM[948]="***When the king heard him, he replied*";
P_HTM[949]="***59. “What will one jewel do, O youth? And what will one thoroughbred avail? Many precious jewels belong to a king, and many peerless steeds swift like the wind.*";
P_HTM[950]="***The Jewel*";
P_HTM[951]="***When he heard the king’s speech, he said: “O king, why do you say this? There is one horse, and there are also a thousand and a hundred thousand horses; there is one jewel, and there are also a thousand jewels; but all the horses put together are not equal to this one, see what its swiftness is.” So saying, he mounted the horse and galloped it along the top of a wall, and the city wall seven leagues in length was as it were surrounded by horses striking neck against neck, and then in course of time neither horse nor Yakkha could be distinguished, and a single strip of red cloth tied on his belly seemed to be spread out all round the wall. Then he alighted from the horse, and, telling him that he had now seen the steed’s swiftness, he bade him next mark something new: and, lo, he made the horse gallop within the city garden on the surface of the water, and he leapt without wetting his hoofs; then he made him walk on the leaves of the lotus beds, and when he clapped his hand and stretched out his arm the horse came and stood upon the palm of his hand. Then he said: “This is indeed a jewel of a horse, O king.” “It is indeed, O youth.” “Well, let the jewel of a horse be put on one side for a while, see now the power of the precious jewel.”*";
P_HTM[952]="***60-61. “O greatest of men, behold this peerless jewel of mine; in it are the bodies of women and the bodies of men; the bodies of beasts are in it and the bodies of birds, the Nāga kings and Supaṇṇas, all are created in this jewel.*";
P_HTM[953]="***62-63. An elephant host, a chariot host, horses, foot-soldiers, and banners, behold this complete army created in the jewel; elephant-riders, the king’s body-guard, warriors fighting from chariots, warriors fighting on foot, and troops in battle array, behold all created in this jewel.*";
P_HTM[954]="***64. Behold created in this jewel a city furnished with solid foundations and with many gateways and walls, and with many pleasant spots where four roads meet.*";
P_HTM[955]="***65. Pillars and trenches, bars and bolts, watch-towers and gates, behold all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[956]="***66-67. See various troops of birds in the roads under the gateways, geese, herons, peacocks, ruddy geese and ospreys; cuckoos, spotted birds, peacocks, jīvajīvakas, birds of every sort behold gathered together and created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[957]="***68-69. See a marvellous city with grand walls, making the hair stand erect with wonder, pleasant with banners upraised, and with its sands all of gold, see the hermitages divided regularly in blocks, and the different houses and their yards, with streets and blind lanes between.*";
P_HTM[958]="***70. Behold the drinking shops and taverns, the slaughter-houses and cooks’ shops, and the harlots and wantons, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[959]="***71. The garland-weavers, the washermen, the astrologers, the cloth merchants, the gold workers, the jewellers – behold created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[960]="***73. See drums and tabours, conchs, tambours and tambourines and all kinds of cymbals, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[961]="***74. Cymbals, and lutes, dance and song well executed, musical instruments and gongs, behold created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[962]="***75. Jumpers and wrestlers too are here, and a sight of jugglers, and royal bards and barbers, behold created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[963]="***76. Crowds are gathered here of men and women, see the seats tiers beyond tiers created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[964]="***77. See the wrestlers in the crowd striking their doubled arms, see the strikers and the stricken, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[965]="***78-80. See on the slopes of the mountains troops of various deer, lions, tigers, boars, bears, wolves, and hyenas; rhinoceroses, gayals, buffaloes, red deer, rurus, antelopes, wild boars, niṅkas and hogs, spotted kadalī-deer, cats, rabbits, all kinds of hosts of beasts, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[966]="***81-82. Rivers well-situated, paved with golden sand, clear with flowing waters and filled with quantities of fishes; crocodiles, sea-monsters are here and porpoises and turtles, pāṭhīnas, pāvusas, vālajas, and muñjarohitas.*";
P_HTM[967]="***83. Behold created in the jewel all kinds of trees, filled with various birds, and a forest with its branches made of lapis lazuli.*";
P_HTM[968]="***84. See too lakes well-distributed in the four quarters, filled with quantities of birds and abounding with fish with broad scales.*";
P_HTM[969]="***85. See the earth surrounded by the sea, abounding with water everywhere, and diversified with trees, all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[970]="***86. See the Videhas in front, the Goyāniyas behind, the Kurus and Jambudīpa all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[971]="***87. See the sun and the moon, shining on the four sides, as they go round Mount Sineru, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[972]="***88. See Sineru and Himavat and the miraculous sea and the four guardians of the world, created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[973]="***89. See parks and forests, crags and mountains, pleasant to look at and full of Kimpurisas, all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[974]="***90. Sakka’s gardens Phārusaka, Cittalatā, Missaka, and Nandana, and his palace Vejayanta, behold all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[975]="***91. Sakka’s palace Sudhamma, the heaven of the Thirty-Three, the heavenly tree Pāricchatta in full flower, and Sakka’s elephant Erāvaṇa, behold created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[976]="***92. See here the Devakaññās risen like lightning in the air, wandering about in the Nandana, all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[977]="***93. See the Devakaññās bewitching the Devaputtas, and the Devaputtas wandering about, all created in the jewel,*";
P_HTM[978]="***94. Behold more than a thousand palaces covered with lapis lazuli, all created with brilliant colours in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[979]="***95. And the beings of the Tāvatiṁsa heaven and the Yāma heaven and the Tusita heaven, and those of the Paranimmita heaven all created in the jewel.*";
P_HTM[980]="***96. See here pure lakes with transparent water covered with heavenly coral trees and lotuses and water-lilies.*";
P_HTM[981]="***97. In this jewel are ten white lines and ten beautiful lines dark blue; twenty-one brown, and fourteen yellow.*";
P_HTM[982]="***98. Twenty golden lines, twenty silver, and thirty appear of a red colour.*";
P_HTM[983]="***99. Sixteen are black, twenty-five are of the colour of madder, these are mixed with bandhuka flowers and variegated with blue lotuses.*";
P_HTM[984]="***100. O king, best of men, look at this bright flame-like jewel, perfect in all its parts, this is the destined prize for him who wins.”*";
P_HTM[985]="***Questions about the Household Life*";
P_HTM[986]="***Puṇṇaka, having thus spoken, went on to say, “O great king, if I am overcome by you in play I will give you this precious jewel, but what will you give me?” “Except my body and white umbrella let all that I have be the prize.” “Then my lord, do not delay – I have come from a far distance – let the gaming room be got ready.” So the king gave orders to his ministers and they quickly got the hall ready and prepared a carpet of the finest fibre-cloth for the king and seats for the other kings, and having appointed a suitable seat for Puṇṇaka, they told the king that the time was come. Then Puṇṇaka addressed the king in a verse:*";
P_HTM[987]="***101. “O king, proceed to the appointed goal, you have not such a jewel: let us conquer by fair dealing, and by the absence of violence, and when you are conquered pay down your stake.”*";
P_HTM[988]="***Then the king replied, “O youth, do not be afraid of me as the king, our several victory or defeat shall be by fair dealing and by the absence of violence.” Then Puṇṇaka uttered a verse as calling the other kings to witness that the victory was to be gained by fair dealing only:*";
P_HTM[989]="***102. “O lofty Pañcāla and Surasena, O Macchas, and Maddas, with the Kekakas, let them all see that the contest is without treachery, no one is to interfere in our assembly.”*";
P_HTM[990]="***Then the king attended by a hundred kings took Puṇṇaka and went into the gaming hall, and they all sat down on suitable seats, and placed the golden dice on the silver board. Then Puṇṇaka said quickly, “O king, there are twenty-four throws in playing with dice, they are called mālika, sāvaṭa, bahula, santi, bhadra, and so on; choose you whichever pleases you.” The king assented and chose the bahula, Puṇṇaka chose that called sāvaṭa. Then the king said: “O youth, do you play the dice first.” “O king, the first throw does not fall to me, do you play.” The king consented.*";
P_HTM[991]="***Now his mother in his last existence but one before this was his guardian deity and by her power the king wins in play. She was standing close by, and the king remembering the goddess sang the song of play and turned the dice in his hand and threw them up into the air. By Puṇṇaka’s power the dice fell so as to conquer the king. The king by his skill in play recognised that the dice were falling against him and seizing them and mixing them together in the air he threw them again in the air, but he detected that they were again falling against him and seized them as they were.*";
P_HTM[992]="***Then Puṇṇaka thought to himself, “This king, though he is playing with a Yakkha like me, mixes the dice as they fall and so takes them up, what can be the reason of this?” Then, having recognised the power of the guardian Devatā, he opened his eyes wide as if he were angry and looked at her and she being frightened fled and took refuge trembling in the top of the Cakkavāla mountain. The king, when he threw the dice a third time, although he knew that they would fall against him could not put out his hand and seize them in consequence of Puṇṇaka’s power and they fell against the king. Then Puṇṇaka threw the dice and they fell favourable to him. Then knowing that he had won he clapped his hands with a loud noise, saying three times, “I have won, I have won,” and that sound thrilled through all Jambudīpa.*";
P_HTM[993]="***The Teacher described the event as follows:*";
P_HTM[994]="***103. “The king of the Kurus and the Yakkha Puṇṇaka entered wild with the intoxication of play; the king played the losing throw and the Yakkha Puṇṇaka the winning throw.*";
P_HTM[995]="***104. They two met there in contest in the presence of the kings and amidst the witnesses, the Yakkha conquered the mightiest of men and loud was the tumult which arose there.”*";
P_HTM[996]="***The king was displeased at being conquered, and Puṇṇaka repeated a verse to comfort him:*";
P_HTM[997]="***105. “Victory and defeat belong to one or another of the contending parties, O king; O king, you have lost the great prize; being worsted, pay down the price forthwith.”*";
P_HTM[998]="***Then he bade him take it in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[999]="***106. “Elephants, oxen, horses, jewels and earrings, whatever gems I have in the earth, take the best of wealth, O Kaccāna, take it and go where you wish.”*";
P_HTM[1000]="***Puṇṇaka answered:*";
P_HTM[1001]="***107. “Elephants, oxen, horses, jewels and earrings, whatever gems you have in the earth, Vidhura the minister is the best of them all, he has been won by me, pay him down to me.”*";
P_HTM[1002]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[1003]="***108. “He is my minister, my refuge and help, my shelter, my fortress and my defence, that minister of mine is not to be weighed against wealth, that minister of mine is like my life.”*";
P_HTM[1004]="***Puṇṇaka answered:*";
P_HTM[1005]="***109. “There would be a long contest between you and me, let us go to him and ask him what he wishes, let him decide this matter between us, let then what he determines be the judgment of us both.”*";
P_HTM[1006]="***The king replied:*";
P_HTM[1007]="***110. “Verily you speak truth, O youth, you utter no injustice, let us go at once and ask him: in this way we shall both be satisfied.”*";
P_HTM[1008]="***So saying the king took the hundred kings and Puṇṇaka went gladly in haste to the court of justice; and the sage rose from his seat and saluted the king and sat on one side. Then Puṇṇaka addressed the Great Being and said: “O wise man, you are firm in justice, you will not utter a falsehood, even for the sake of life; such is the echo of your fame which has spread through the whole world. I shall know today whether you are really firm in justice,” and so saying he uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[1009]="***111. “Have the gods truly set you among the Kurus as the councillor Vidhura firm in justice? Are you the slave or the kinsman of the king? What is your value in the world, Vidhura?”*";
P_HTM[1010]="***Then the Great Being thought to himself, “This man asks this question of me; but I cannot tell him whether I am a kinsman of the king or whether I am superior to the king or whether I am nothing to the king.In this world there is no protection like the truth; one must speak the truth.” So he uttered two verses to show that he was no kinsman to the king nor his superior, but only one of his four slaves:*";
P_HTM[1011]="***112. “Some are slaves from their mothers, others are slaves bought for money, some come of their own will as slaves, others are slaves driven by fear. These are the four sorts of slaves among men.*";
P_HTM[1012]="***113. I verily am a slave from my birth: my weal and my woe come from the king, I am the king’s slave even if I go to another, he may give me by right to you, O young man.”*";
P_HTM[1013]="***Puṇṇaka, on hearing this, being excessively pleased, clapped his hands and said:*";
P_HTM[1014]="***114. “This is my second victory today, your minister when asked has answered your question; verily the best of kings is unjust; it has been well decided, but you do not give it to me.”*";
P_HTM[1015]="***Hearing this the king was angry with the Great Being and said: “Not regarding one who can confer honour like me you regard this young man who catches your eye,” then turning to Puṇṇaka, and saying: “If he is a slave take him and go,” he uttered the following verse:*";
P_HTM[1016]="***115. “If he has thus answered our question, saying, ‘I am a slave and not a kinsman,’ then take, O Kaccāna, this best of treasures, take it and go whither you will.”*";
P_HTM[1017]="***But when the king had thus spoken, he reflected: “The young man will take the sage and go where he pleases, and after he is once gone I shall find it hard to get any sweet converse about holy things; what if I were to set him in his proper place and ask him some question in reference to a householder’s life?” So he said to him, “O sage, after you are gone I shall find it hard to get any sweet converse about holy things; will you sit down in a well-decorated Dhamma seat and taking your proper position expound to me a question relating to the householder’s life?” He assented, and having sat down in a well-decorated pulpit he expounded the question which the king asked; and this was the question:*";
P_HTM[1018]="***116. “O Vidhura, how shall there be a prosperous life to him who lives as a householder in his own house? How shall there be for him kind favour among his own people?*";
P_HTM[1019]="***117. How shall he be free from suffering? And how shall the young man who speaks truth escape all sorrow when he reaches the next world?”*";
P_HTM[1020]="***118. Then Vidhura, full of wisdom and insight, he who sees the real aim and presses steadily onward, he who knows all doctrines, uttered these words:*";
P_HTM[1021]="***119. “Let him not have a wife in common with another; let him not eat a dainty meal alone; let him not deal in vain conversation, for this increases not wisdom.*";
P_HTM[1022]="***120. Virtuous, faithful to his duties, not careless, quick to discern, humble-minded, not hard-hearted, compassionate, affectionate, gentle.*";
P_HTM[1023]="***121. Skilled in winning friends, ready to distribute, prudent in arranging in accordance with the season, let him continually satisfy the monks and brahmins with food and drink.*";
P_HTM[1024]="***122. Let him long for righteousness and be a pillar of the sacred text, ever ready to ask questions and let him reverentially attend to the virtuous and learned.*";
P_HTM[1025]="***123. Thus shall there be a prosperous life for one who lives as a householder in his own house, thus shall there be for him kind favour among his own people.*";
P_HTM[1026]="***124. Thus shall he be free from suffering; and thus the youth who speaks truth shall escape all sorrow when he reaches the next world.”*";
P_HTM[1027]="***The Great Being, having thus expounded the question relating to the householder’s life, came down from his seat and made his salutation to the king. The king also, having paid him great respect, went away to his own abode, surrounded by the hundred kings.*";
P_HTM[1028]="***The Signs*";
P_HTM[1029]="***When the Great Being returned, Puṇṇaka said to him:*";
P_HTM[1030]="***125. “Come, I will now depart, you were given to me by the king; attend only to this duty – this is the ancient law.”*";
P_HTM[1031]="***The sage Vidhura replied:*";
P_HTM[1032]="***126. “I know it, O youth; I was won by you; I was given by the king to you; let me lodge you for three days in my home while I exhort my sons.”*";
P_HTM[1033]="***When Puṇṇaka heard this, he thought within himself, “The sage has spoken the truth; this will be a great benefit to me; if he had asked leave to lodge me there for seven days or even for a fortnight, I ought at once to have assented,” so he answered:*";
P_HTM[1034]="***127. “Let that advantage be for me too, let us dwell there three days; do, sir, whatever needs to be done in your home; instruct today your sons and your wife, that they may be happy after you are gone.”*";
P_HTM[1035]="***So saying, Puṇṇaka went with the Great Being to his home.*";
P_HTM[1036]="***The Teacher thus described the incident:*";
P_HTM[1037]="***128. “Gladly assenting and eagerly longing, the Yakkha went with Vidhura; and the best of the holy ones introduced him into his home, attended by elephants and thoroughbred steeds.”*";
P_HTM[1038]="***Now the Great Being had three palaces for the three seasons, one of them was called Koñca [Heron], another Mayūra [Peacock], and the third Piyaketa; this verse was uttered about them:*";
P_HTM[1039]="***129. “He went there to Koñca, Mayūra, and Piyaketa, each of most pleasant aspect, furnished with abundance of food and plenty to eat and to drink, like Sakka’s own palace Masakkasāra.”*";
P_HTM[1040]="***After his arrival, he had a sleeping-chamber, and a raised platform in the seventh story of the decorated palace, and having had a royal couch spread and every kind of dainty to eat and drink set out, he presented to him five hundred women like Devakaññās, saying: “Let these be your attendants, stay here without a care,” and then went to his own abode. When he was gone, these women took their different musical instruments end performed all kinds of dances as they attended on Puṇṇaka.*";
P_HTM[1041]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1042]="***130. “These women adorned like Accharā among the Devas dance and sing and address him, each better in her turn.*";
P_HTM[1043]="***131. The guardian of the Dhamma, having given him food and drink and fair women, next, thinking only of his highest good, brought him into the presence of his wife.”*";
P_HTM[1044]="***132. Then he said to his wife, who was adorned with sandal and liquid perfumes and stood like an ornament of purest gold, ‘Come, listen, lady; call your sons here, O fair one with eyes of the hue of copper.’*";
P_HTM[1045]="***133. Anujjā, hearing her husband’s words, spoke to her daughter-in-law, fair-eyed and with nails like copper, ‘O Cetā, who wearest your bracelets as an armour, and are like a blue water-lily, go, call my sons hither.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1046]="***Having uttered her assent and traversed the whole length of the palace she assembled all the friends as well as the sons and daughters, saying: “Your father wishes to give you an exhortation, this will be your last sight of him.” When the young prince Dhammapāla heard this he began to weep, and went before his father surrounded by his younger brothers. When the father saw them, unable to maintain his tranquillity, he embraced them with eyes full of tears, and kissed their heads and pressed his eldest son for a moment to his heart. Then, raising him up from his bosom and going out of the royal chamber, he sat down in the middle of the couch on the raised platform and delivered his address to his thousand sons.*";
P_HTM[1047]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1048]="***134. “The guardian of the Dhamma, without trembling, kissed his sons on their foreheads when they drew near, and having addressed them uttered these words, ‘I have been given by the king to this young man.*";
P_HTM[1049]="***135. I am subject to him, but today I was free to seek my own pleasure, he will now take me and go whither he will, and I am come to admonish you, for how could I go if I had not given you safe haven?*";
P_HTM[1050]="***136. If Janasandha, the king who dwells in Kurukhetta, should very earnestly ask you, “What do you reckon as having been ancient even in ancient time? What, did your father teach first and foremost?” and if he were then to say,*";
P_HTM[1051]="***137. “You are all of an equal position with me, which of you here is not more than a king?” Do you make a respectful salutation and reply to him, “Say not so, O monarch, this is not the Dhamma; how shall the baseborn jackal be of equal position with the royal tiger?” ’ ”*";
P_HTM[1052]="***Having heard this discourse of his the sons and daughters and all the kinsmen, friends, servants, and common folk were unable to maintain their tranquillity and uttered a loud cry; and the Great Being consoled them.*";
P_HTM[1053]="***The King’s Court*";
P_HTM[1054]="***Then having come to all those kinsmen and seeing that they were silent, he said: “Children, do not grieve, all material things are impermanent, honour ends in misfortune; nevertheless I will tell you of a means of obtaining honour, namely, a king’s court; listen to it with your minds earnestly intent.” Then through the Buddha’s magic power he made them enter into a royal court. The Teacher thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1055]="***138. “Then Vidhura thus addressed his friends and his enemies, his kindred, and his intimates, with his mind and will detached from all things,*";
P_HTM[1056]="***139. ‘Come, dear ones, sit down and listen to me as I tell of a royal dwelling, how a man who enters a king’s court may attain to honour.*";
P_HTM[1057]="***140. When he enters a king’s court he does not win honour while he is unknown, nor does one ever win it who is a coward, nor the foolish man, nor the thoughtless.*";
P_HTM[1058]="***141. When the king finds out his moral qualities, his wisdom and his purity of heart, then he learns to trust him and hides not his secrets from him.*";
P_HTM[1059]="***142-143. When he is asked to carry out some business, like a well-fixed balance, with a level beam, and evenly poised, he must not hesitate; if like the balance, he is ready to undertake every burden, he may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1060]="***144. Whether by day or by night, the wiser man should not hesitate when set upon the king’s business; such a one may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1061]="***145. The wise man who, when set upon the king’s business, whether by day or by night, undertakes every commission, he is the one who may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1062]="***146. He who sees a path made for the king and carefully put in order for him, and refrains from entering himself therein, though advised to do so, he is the one who may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1063]="***147. Let him on no account ever enjoy the same pleasures as the king, let him follow behind in everything, such a one may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1064]="***148. Let him not put on a garment like the king’s nor garlands nor ointment like his; let him not wear similar ornaments or practise a tone of voice like his; let him always wear a different attire, such a one may dwell in a king’s court.*";
P_HTM[1065]="***149. If the king sports with his ministers or surrounded by his wives, let not the minister make any allusion to the royal ladies.*";

P_HTM[1098]="***Three days went by as he thus discoursed to his sons, wives, friends and others. Then, knowing that the time was accomplished, early in the morning, after having eaten his meal of various dainties, he said: “I will take my leave of the king and depart with the young man,” so he went to the king’s palace surrounded by a company of kinsmen and saluted the king and stood on one side, and uttered his words of wise practical counsel.*";
P_HTM[1099]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1100]="***184. “Having thus counselled the company of his kindred, the wise one, surrounded by his friends, went up to the king.*";
P_HTM[1101]="***185. Having saluted his feet with his head and made a reverential homage, Vidhura with his hands clasped thus addressed the king,*";
P_HTM[1102]="***186. ‘This youth, wishing to employ me according to his will, is leading me away; I will speak for the sake of my kindred, hear what I say, O enemy-conqueror.*";
P_HTM[1103]="***187. Will you be pleased to look to my sons and whatever property I may have besides in my house, so that when I am gone my company of kinsmen may not hereafter perish?*";
P_HTM[1104]="***188. As when the earth trembles that which is upon it likewise trembles, and as when the earth is firm it all remains firm, so I see that my kindred fall in my fall; this I perceive was my error.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1105]="***When the king heard this, he said: “O sage, your going pleases me not; do not go; I will send for the young man on some pretext, then we will kill him and hush it up,” and in illustration of this he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[1106]="***189. “You can not go, this is my resolve; having smitten and slain this Kātiya fellow, do you dwell here, this is what seems best to me; do not go hence, O you possessed of such vast wisdom.”*";
P_HTM[1107]="***When the Great Being heard this he exclaimed, “Such an intention is not worthy of you,” and then he added,*";
P_HTM[1108]="***190. “Do not set your mind on unrighteousness, be you devoted to temporal and spiritual good; shame on an action which is ignoble and sinful, which when a man has done, he goes afterwards to hell.*";
P_HTM[1109]="***191. This is not righteousness, this is not what ought to be done; a king, O lord of men, is the supreme authority of a poor slave, which sets him to kill or to burn or kills by its own act; I have no wrath against him and I depart.”*";
P_HTM[1110]="***So saying the Great Being respectfully saluted the king and exhorted the king’s wives and his officers; and then went out from the palace while they, unable to retain their fortitude, burst out into a bitter cry; and all the inhabitants of the city exclaimed, “The sage is going with the young man, come, we will see him as he goes,” and they gazed upon him in the king’s court. Then they too said to one another, “Sorrow not for it, all material things are transitory, be zealous in generosity and other good works,” and then they returned and went each to his own house. The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1111]="***192. “Having embraced his eldest son and controlled the anguish in his heart, with eyes filled with tears he entered the palace.”*";
P_HTM[1112]="***Now in the palace there were a thousand sons, a thousand daughters, a thousand wives, and seven hundred courtesans, and with these and the other servants and attendants and relations and friends lying prostrate everywhere the palace appeared like a Sāl grove with its trees strewed about by the fury of the great wind which heralds the end of the world.*";
P_HTM[1113]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1114]="***193. “The sons and wives of Vidhura lie prostrate in the palace like Sāl trees shaken and shattered by the wind.*";
P_HTM[1115]="***194. A thousand wives, and seven hundred female slaves wailed stretching out their arms, in the palace of Vidhura.*";
P_HTM[1116]="***195. The ladies of the harem and the princes, the Vesiyas and brahmins wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.*";
P_HTM[1117]="***196. Elephant-drivers, the soldiers of the body-guard, charioteers and foot-soldiers wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.*";
P_HTM[1118]="***197. The people of the country and the towns collected together wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.”*";
P_HTM[1119]="***The Great Being, having comforted the vast assembly and performed all that remained to be done and exhorted the ladies of the harem and pointed out all that needed to be told, went to Puṇṇaka and announced to him that he had done everything that was to be done.*";
P_HTM[1120]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1121]="***202. “Having done all that was to be done within the house and having instructed all the people, his friends and counsellors and companions, his wives, sons and relations.*";
P_HTM[1122]="***203. Having arranged the outside work which demanded attention and informed them of the stores in the house, the treasure and the debts that were to be paid, he thus spoke to Puṇṇaka:*";
P_HTM[1123]="***204. ‘You have dwelt three days in my house, I have done all that needed to be done in my home, I have instructed my sons and my wives, let us now act according to your will, O Kaccāna.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1124]="***Puṇṇaka replied:*";
P_HTM[1125]="***205. “If, O you who attest of your own will, you have instructed your sons, your wives, and your dependents, then, alas, you stand here as one about to cross: this is a long journey before you.*";
P_HTM[1126]="***206. Take hold, without fear, of the tail of your noble steed, this is your last sight of the world of the living.”*";
P_HTM[1127]="***Then the Great Being said to him:*";
P_HTM[1128]="***207. “Of whom shall I be afraid, when I have done no evil to him by body, speech or thought, whereby I could come to misfortune?”*";
P_HTM[1129]="***So the Great Being, uttering a loud shout, fearless like an undismayed lion, said: “This is my robe – put it not off without my permission,” and then, guided by his own perfect resolution, and having girt his robes tightly, he disentangled the horse’s tail and seizing it firmly with both hands, he pressed the horse’s thighs with his two feet and said to him,“I have seized the tail, proceed, O youth, as you will.” At that moment Puṇṇaka gave a signal to the horse who was endowed with reason, and he forthwith bounded into the sky, carrying the seer.*";
P_HTM[1130]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1131]="***208. “The prince of horses bearing Vidhura went up into the sky and soon reached the Black Mountain without coming into contact with the boughs of trees or the rocks.”*";
P_HTM[1132]="***While Puṇṇaka thus went off carrying the Great Being with him, the seer’s sons and the other spectators went to Puṇṇaka’s dwelling; but when they found not the Great Being, they lamented with loud and repeated cries, falling down as if their feet had been cut off.*";
P_HTM[1133]="***When they thus had seen and heard the Great Being, as he went up without any cause into the sky, and had thus uttered their lamentations, they all went wailing to the king’s gate, accompanied by all the citizens. The king, hearing the loud sound of lamentation, opened his window and asked why they lamented. They replied, “O sire, that was no brahmin youth, but a Yakkha who has come in the guise of a brahmin and carried off the seer; without him there is no life for us; if he does not return on the seventh day from this, we will collect timber in hundreds, yes, thousands of carts and will all enter the fire.”*";
P_HTM[1134]="***When the king heard their words, he replied, “The sage with his honied speech will soon beguile the youth by his Dhamma discourse and will make him fall down at his feet, and will before long come back and bring smiles to your tearful faces, sorrow not,” and he repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[1135]="***218. “The seer is wise, and learned, and skilful; he will soon set himself free; fear not, he will come back.”*";
P_HTM[1136]="***The Duties of a Good Man*";
P_HTM[1137]="***Meantime Puṇṇaka, after he had set the Great Being on the top of the Black Mountain, thought to himself, “As long as this man lives there is no chance of prosperity for me; I will kill him, and take his heart’s flesh and I will then go to the Nāga world and give it to Varuṇa, and having thus obtained his daughter Irandatī I shall rise to the world of the gods.”*";
P_HTM[1138]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1139]="***219. “When he had gone there he thought to himself: ‘Rational beings exist in various gradations; I have no possible use for his life, I will kill him and take his heart.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1140]="***Then again he thought: “What if without killing him by my own hand I were to cause him to perish by showing him some frightful shape?” So having assumed the form of a frightful Yakkha, he went up to him and threw him down, and seizing him in his mouth made as if he were about to devour him; but not a hair of the Great Being stood on end.*";
P_HTM[1141]="***Then he came up in the shape of a lion and of a furious elephant, he threatened to attack him with teeth and tusks; and when the other still showed no fear, he assumed the appearance of a great serpent as big as a great trough-shaped canoe, and coming up to him hissing and coiling his body round him it covered his head with its hood, but the other showed no signs of alarm.*";
P_HTM[1142]="***Then he said: “As he stands on the top of a mountain and falls down, I will shatter him into fragments by the fall,” so he raised up a mighty wind; but it stirred not the end of one of his hairs. Then he set him on the top of a mountain and himself standing in the form of an elephant, he made it shake to and fro like a wild date palm tree, but even then he could not stir one hair of his head from its place.*";
P_HTM[1143]="***Then he said: “I will make his heart burst through terror at some frightful sound,” so he entered the inside of the mountain, and uttering a tremendous roar filled heaven and earth with one mighty sound; but still the Great Being showed no alarm; for he knew that he who had thus come in the form of a Yakkha and a lion and an elephant and a Nāga, and had shaken the mountain with the wind and rain, and had entered into the mountain and uttered the great roar, was still only a man and nothing else.*";
P_HTM[1144]="***Then the Yakkha thought to himself, “I shall not be able to kill him by external attacks, I shall only destroy him by my own hand.” So he set the Great Being on the top of a mountain and himself going to the mountain’s foot rose up from the centre of the mountain as though he were inserting a white thread into a perforated gem, and with a roar he seized the Great Being violently and whirled him round, and flung him head downwards into the sky where there was nothing that he could lay hold of. It has thus been described:*";
P_HTM[1145]="***220. “Having gone there and entered within the mountain Kātiyāna of evil mind held him with his head downwards in the open expanse of the world.*";
P_HTM[1146]="***221. While he hung there as on the precipice of hell frightful to see and most difficult to traverse, he, the best of all the Kurus in action, thus addressed Puṇṇaka undismayed:*";
P_HTM[1147]="***222. ‘You are base in your nature, though you assume for a time a noble form, utterly licentious though wearing the guise of one restrained, you are doing a cruel and monstrous deed, there is nothing good in your nature.*";
P_HTM[1148]="***223. What is your reason for killing me, when you wish to see me thrown down this precipice? Your appearance bespeaks you as something superhuman, tell me what kind of a god you are.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1149]="***Puṇṇaka answered:*";
P_HTM[1150]="***224. “You have heard perchance of the Yakkha Puṇṇaka, he is the minister of king Kuvera. There is an earth-ruling Nāga called Varuṇa, mighty, pure, and endowed with beauty and strength.*";
P_HTM[1151]="***225. I desire his younger sister, the Nāga maiden named Irandatī; for the love of that fair damsel I have set my mind on killing you, O sage.”*";
P_HTM[1152]="***The Great Being reflected: “This world is ruined by a thing being misunderstood, why should a wooer of a Nāga maiden want my death? I will learn the whole truth of the matter,” so he uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[1153]="***226. “Be not deceived, O Yakkha; many people are destroyed by a thing being misunderstood; what has your love for that fair maiden to do with my death? Come, let us hear the whole.”*";
P_HTM[1154]="***Then Puṇṇaka said to him,*";
P_HTM[1155]="***227. “In my love for the daughter of that mighty Nāga I consulted her kinsfolk, and when I sought her hand my father-in-law told me that they knew that I was moved by an honourable passion.*";
P_HTM[1156]="***228. ‘We will give you the damsel endowed with beautiful body and eyes, fair-smiling and with her limbs perfumed with sandalwood, if you bring to me the sage’s heart won in fair fight; the maiden is to be won by this prize, we ask no other gift besides.’*";
P_HTM[1157]="***229. Thus I am not deceived, listen, O you doer of right actions; there is nothing misunderstood by me; the Nāgas will give me the Nāga maiden Irandatī for your heart won in fair fight.*";
P_HTM[1158]="***230. It is for this that I am set on killing you, it is in this way that I have need of your death. If I threw you hence down into hell I would kill you and take your heart.”*";
P_HTM[1159]="***When the Great Being heard this he reflected: “Vimalā has no need of my heart. Varuṇa, after he had heard the discourse on the Dhamma and honoured me with his jewel must have gone home and described my power in discoursing concerning the Dhamma, and Vimalā must have felt a great longing to hear my words. Puṇṇaka must have been ordered by Varuṇa through a misconception, and he influenced by this his own misconception has brought about all this calamity. Now my character as a sage consists in my power to bring to light and to discover absolute truths. If Puṇṇaka kills me, what good will it do? Come, I will say to him, ‘Young man, I know the Dhamma as followed by good men; before I die, set me on the top of the mountain and hear the Dhamma of good men from me; and afterwards do what you will;’ and after having declared to him the Dhamma of good men I will let him take my life.” So he uttered this verse as he hung with his head downwards:*";
P_HTM[1160]="***231. “Hold me up forthwith, O Kātiyāna, if you needest my heart; I will declare to you this day the Dhamma of the good man.”*";
P_HTM[1161]="***Then Puṇṇaka reflected: “This law will never have been declared before to gods or men; I will forthwith hold him up and hear the Dhamma of good men,” so he lifted the Great Being up and set him on the summit of the mountain.*";
P_HTM[1162]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1163]="***232. “Puṇṇaka, having quickly placed the best of the performers of good actions among the Kurus upon the mountain’s summit, asked the Teacher of lofty wisdom, as he sat looking at a pipul tree:*";
P_HTM[1164]="***233. ‘I have brought you up from the precipice, I have need of your heart this day, tell me then today the Dhamma of the good man.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1165]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[1166]="***234. “I am saved by you from the precipice; if you need my heart, I will declare to you this day the Dhamma of the good man.” Then the Great Being said: “My body is dirty, I will bathe.” The Yakkha consented, so he brought some water, and when he was bathing, he gave the Great Being some heavenly cloth and perfumes, and so on, and after he was adorned and dressed he gave him some heavenly food. When he had eaten, the Great Being caused the top of the Black Mountain to be covered with adornment, and prepared a richly decorated seat, and being seated thereon uttered a verse, describing in it the duty of the good man with a Buddha’s triumphant mastery:*";
P_HTM[1167]="***235. “O youth, follow you the path already traversed; put away from you the soiled hand, be not ever treacherous to your friends, nor fall into the power of unchaste women.”*";
P_HTM[1168]="***The Yakkha, being unable to comprehend these four rules expressed so concisely, asked in detail:*";
P_HTM[1169]="***236. “How does one follow the path already traversed? How does one burn the wet hand? Who is the unchaste woman? Who is treacherous to his friend? Tell me the meaning at my request.”*";
P_HTM[1170]="***The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[1171]="***237. “Let a man follow his actions, who invites him even to a seat, when he comes as a stranger and never seen before; him the wise call one who follows in the path already traversed.*";
P_HTM[1172]="***238. In whosoever house a man dwells even for one night, and receives there food and drink, let him not conceive an evil thought against him in his mind; he who is treacherous to his friend burns the innocent hand.*";
P_HTM[1173]="***239. Let not a man break a bough of that tree under whose shadow he sits or lies, the wretch is treacherous to his friend.*";
P_HTM[1174]="***240. Let a man give this earth filled with riches to the woman whom he has chosen, yet she will despise him if she gets the opportunity; let him not fall into the power of unchaste women.*";
P_HTM[1175]="***241. Thus does a man follow the path already traversed; thus does he burn the wet hand; this is the unchaste woman; this is one that is treacherous to his friend; such a man is righteous, abandon you unrighteousness.”*";
P_HTM[1176]="***Thus did the Great Being declare to the Yakkha with a Buddha’s triumphant mastery the four duties of a good man.*";
P_HTM[1177]="***Black Rock*";
P_HTM[1178]="***When he heard them Puṇṇaka reflected: “In these four propositions the sage is only asking his own life; for he verily welcomed me though I was before unknown; I dwelt in his house three days, receiving great honour from him; I, doing him this wrong, do it for a woman’s sake; I am moreover in every way treacherous to my friends; if I shall do injury to the sage, I shall not follow the duty of a good man; what need have I of the Nāga maiden? I will carry him forthwith to Indapatta and gladden the weeping faces of its inhabitants and I will seat him in the convocation hall there.” Then he spoke aloud: 242. “I dwelt three days in your house, I was served with food and drink, you were my friend, I will let you go, O seer of excellent wisdom, you shall depart at your will to your own home.*";
P_HTM[1179]="***243. Yea, let all that concerns the Nāga race perish, I have had enough of the Nāga maiden; by your own well-spoken words you are set free, O seer, from my threatened blow today.”*";
P_HTM[1180]="***The Great Being replied, “O youth, send me not away to my own home but carry me to the Nāga dwelling,” and he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[1181]="***244. “Come, Yakkha, carry me to your father-in-law, and act as is best towards me; I will show to him a royal Nāga palace which he has never seen before.”*";
P_HTM[1182]="***Puṇṇaka said:*";
P_HTM[1183]="***245. “The wise man should not look on that which is not for a man’s well-being; why then, O seer of excellent wisdom, do you wish to go amongst your enemies?”*";
P_HTM[1184]="***The Great Being answered:*";
P_HTM[1185]="***246. “Verily I know it all; the wise man ought not to look upon it; but I have never at any time committed evil, and therefore I fear not the coming of death.*";
P_HTM[1186]="***Moreover by my discourse concerning the Dhamma such a cruel being as thyself was won over and softened, and now you say, ‘I have had enough of the Nāga maiden, go you to thine own home;’ it is now my task to soften the Nāga king, carry me there forthwith.” When he heard this, Puṇṇaka consented, saying:*";
P_HTM[1187]="***247. “Come, you shall see with me that world of unequalled glory where the Nāga king dwells amidst dance and song like king Vessavaṇa in Nalinī.*";
P_HTM[1188]="***248. Filled with troops of Nāga maidens, gladdened constantly with their sports day and night, abounding with garlands and covered with flowers, it shines like the lightning in the sky.*";
P_HTM[1189]="***249. Filled with food and with drink, with dance and song and instruments of music; filled with maidens richly attired, it shines with dresses and ornaments.”*";
P_HTM[1190]="***[The Teacher described it:]*";
P_HTM[1191]="***250. “Then Puṇṇaka placed him, the best doer of good actions among the Kurus, on a seat behind him and carried the illustrious sage to the palace of the Nāga king.*";
P_HTM[1192]="***251. When he reached that place of unrivalled glory, the sage stood behind Puṇṇaka; and the Nāga king, beholding the concord between them, thus addressed his son-in-law as he had done before.*";
P_HTM[1193]="***252. ‘You did go before to the world of men, seeking for the sage’s heart; have you returned here with success, bringing the sage of unequalled wisdom?’ ”*";
P_HTM[1194]="***Puṇṇaka replied:*";
P_HTM[1195]="***253. “He whom you desire is come, he is my guardian in duty, won by righteous means; behold him as he speaks before you, intercourse with the good brings happiness.”*";
P_HTM[1196]="***The Return*";
P_HTM[1197]="***The Nāga king uttered a verse as he saw the Great Being:*";
P_HTM[1198]="***254. “This mortal, beholding me whom he had never seen before and pierced with the fear of death, does not speak to me in his terror; this is not like a wise man.”*";
P_HTM[1199]="***The Great Being thus addressed the Nāga king while he conceived this idea, even though he had not directly said that he would not pay him respect, as the Great Being knew by his omniscience how best to deal with all creatures:*";
P_HTM[1200]="***255. “I am not terrified, O Nāga, nor am I pierced with the fear of death; the victim should not address his executioner, nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.”*";
P_HTM[1201]="***Then the Nāga king uttered a verse in the Great Being’s praise:*";
P_HTM[1202]="***257. “It is as you say, O sage, you speak the truth; the victim should not address his executioner nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.”*";
P_HTM[1203]="***Then the Great Being spoke kindly to the Nāga king:*";
P_HTM[1204]="***259. “This splendour and glory and this might and Nāga birth of thine, are subject to death and not immortal; I ask you this question, O Nāga king, how did you obtain this palace?*";
P_HTM[1205]="***260. Was it gained without a cause or as the development of a previous condition? was it made by yourself or given by the gods? Explain to me this matter, O Nāga king, how you did win this palace.”*";
P_HTM[1206]="***The Nāga king replied:*";
P_HTM[1207]="***261. “It was not gained without a cause, nor was it the development of a previous condition; it was not made by myself nor given by the gods; this palace of mine was gained by my own virtuous deeds.”*";
P_HTM[1208]="***The Great Being answered:*";
P_HTM[1209]="***262. “What holy vow was it, what practice of sanctity? Of what good action was this the fruit, this splendour and glory and might and Nāga birth of thine and this great palace, O Nāga?”*";
P_HTM[1210]="***The Nāga king replied:*";
P_HTM[1211]="***263. “I and my wife in the world of men were both full of faith and bountiful; my house was made into a drinking-hall, and ascetics and brahmins were cheered there.*";
P_HTM[1212]="***264. Garlands and perfumes and ointments, lamps and couches and resting-places, raiment and beds and food and drink, I virtuously gave away there as free gifts.*";
P_HTM[1213]="***265. That was my vow and practice of sanctity, this is the fruit of that good conduct, this splendour and glory and Nāga birth and this great palace, O seer.”*";
P_HTM[1214]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[1215]="***266. “If you have thus gained this palace, you know about the fruit of holy actions and rebirth; therefore practise virtue with all diligence that you may live again in a palace.”*";
P_HTM[1216]="***The Nāga king replied:*";
P_HTM[1217]="***267. “There are no ascetics or brahmins here to whom we may give food and drink, O holy one; tell me this thing I pray, how may I again live in a palace?”*";
P_HTM[1218]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[1219]="***268. “There are snakes who have been born here, sons and wives and dependents; commit no wrong towards them in word or deed at any time.*";
P_HTM[1220]="***269. Thus follow you, O Nāga, innocence in word and deed, so shall you dwell here all your life in a palace and then depart hence to the world of the gods.”*";
P_HTM[1221]="***The Nāga king, having heard the Dhamma discourse of the Great Being, thought to himself, “The sage cannot stay long away from his home; I will show him to Vimalā and let her hear his good words, and so calm her longing desire, and I will gratify king Dhanañjaya and then it will be right to send the sage home,” so he said:*";
P_HTM[1222]="***270. “Verily that best of kings is mourning in your absence, whose intimate minister you are; having once regained you, though now distressed and sick, a man will regain happiness.”*";
P_HTM[1223]="***The Great Being praised the Nāga:*";
P_HTM[1224]="***271. “You do indeed utter the holy words of the good, a peerless word of Dhamma; in such crises of life as these the character of men like me is made known.”*";
P_HTM[1225]="***Then the Nāga king still more delighted uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[1226]="***272. “Say, were you taken for nothing? Say, did he conquer you in the game? He says that he won you fairly – how did you come into his power?”*";
P_HTM[1227]="***The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[1228]="***273. “Puṇṇaka conquered in the game with dice him who was my lord and king; he being conquered gave me to the other; so I was won fairly and not by wrong.”*";
P_HTM[1229]="***274. The great Nāga, delighted and overjoyed, when he heard these noble words of the sage, seized the lord of lofty wisdom by the hand and thus went into the presence of his wife.*";
P_HTM[1230]="***275-276. “He for whom, O Vimalā, you grew pale and food lost its savour in your eyes, this sun, for the sake of whose heart this trouble came upon you, listen well to his words, you will never see him again.”*";
P_HTM[1231]="***277. Vimalā, when she saw the lord of great wisdom, folded the ten fingers of her hands in reverence, and thus addressed the best of the Kurus with her whole soul full of delight:*";
P_HTM[1232]="***278. “This mortal, beholding me whom he had never seen before and pierced with the fear of death, does not speak to me in his terror; this is not like a wise man.”*";
P_HTM[1233]="***279. “I am not terrified, O Nāgī, nor am I pierced with the fear of death; the victim should not address his executioner, nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.”*";
P_HTM[1234]="***298-299. Thus the Nāga maiden asked the sage the same question which the Nāga Varuṇa had asked him before; and the sage by his answer satisfied her as he had before satisfied Varuṇa.*";
P_HTM[1235]="***300. The sage, seeing that the Nāga king and the Nāga maiden were both pleased with his answers, undaunted in soul and with not one hair erect with fear, thus addressed Varuṇa:*";
P_HTM[1236]="***301. “Fear not, O Nāga, here I am; whatever use this body may be to you, whatever it can do by its heart and its flesh, I myself will carry out according to your will.”*";
P_HTM[1237]="***The Nāga king replied:*";
P_HTM[1238]="***302. “The heart of sages is their wisdom, we are delighted today with your wisdom; let him whose name implies perfection take his bride today and let him put you in possession today of the Kurus.” Having thus spoken, Varuṇa gave Irandatī to Puṇṇaka and he in his joy poured out his heart to the Great Being.*";
P_HTM[1239]="***The Great Being has thus described the matter:*";
P_HTM[1240]="***303. “Puṇṇaka, delighted and overjoyed, having won the Nāga maiden Irandatī, with his whole soul full of joy, thus addressed him who was the best of the Kurus in action:*";
P_HTM[1241]="***304. ‘You have made me possessed of a wife, I will do what is due to you, O Vidhura; I give this pearl of jewels and I will put you today in possession of the Kurus.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1242]="***Then the Great Being praised him in another verse:*";
P_HTM[1243]="***305. “May your friendship with your loved wife be indissoluble, and do you in your joy with a happy heart give me the jewel and carry me to Indapatta.”*";
P_HTM[1244]="***[The Teacher described it further:]*";
P_HTM[1245]="***306. “Then Puṇṇaka placed the best of the Kurus in action on a seat before him and carried him, the lord of supreme wisdom, to the city Indapatta.*";
P_HTM[1246]="***307. Swift as the mind of man may travel, his speed was even swifter still; and Puṇṇaka bore the best of the Kurus to the city Indapatta.”*";
P_HTM[1247]="***Then he said to him:*";
P_HTM[1248]="***308. “Behold before you the city Indapatta and its pleasant mango groves and districts; I am possessed of a wife, and you have obtained thine own home.”*";
P_HTM[1249]="***Now on that very day at morning-tide the king saw a dream, and this was what he saw. At the door of the king’s palace there stood a great tree whose trunk was wisdom, and whose branches and boughs were like the virtues, and its fruits the five sacred products of the cow, and it was covered with elephants and horses richly caparisoned; and a great multitude with folded hands were worshipping it with all reverence.*";
P_HTM[1250]="***Then a black man, clothed with red cloth, and wearing earrings of red flowers, and bearing weapons in his hand, came up and cut the tree down by the roots in spite of the expostulations of the multitude, and dragged it off and went away, and then came back and planted it again in its old place and departed.*";
P_HTM[1251]="***Then the king as he comprehended the dream said to himself, “The sage Vidhura and no one else is like the great tree; that youth and no other, who carried off the sage, is like the man who cut the tree down by the roots in spite of the expostulations of the multitude; and verily he will come back and set him at the door of the Dhamma Hall and depart. We shall behold the seer again today.”*";
P_HTM[1252]="***So he joyfully ordered the whole city to be decorated and the Dhamma Hall to be got ready and a pulpit in a pavilion adorned with jewels; and himself surrounded by a hundred kings, with their counsellors, and a multitude of citizens and country people, he consoled them all by saying: “Fear not, you will see the sage again today,” and he seated himself in the Dhamma Hall, looking for the sage’s return. Then Puṇṇaka brought the sage down and seated him in the middle of the assembly at the door of the Dhamma Hall, and then departed with Irandatī to his own celestial city.*";
P_HTM[1253]="***The Teacher has thus described it:*";
P_HTM[1254]="***309. “Puṇṇaka of noble race, having set him down, the best of the Kurus in action, in the middle of the Dhamma Hall, mounted his own noble steed and sped in the sky through the air.*";
P_HTM[1255]="***310. When the king beheld him, he, filled with delight, sprang up and embraced him with his arms, and without a moment’s fear seated him on a throne before him in the midst of the congregation.”*";
P_HTM[1256]="***Then after exchanging friendly greeting with him he welcomed him affectionately and uttered a verse:*";
P_HTM[1257]="***311. “You guide us like a ready-furnished chariot, the Kurus rejoice at seeing you; answer me and tell me this, how was it that that young man let you go?”*";
P_HTM[1258]="***The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[1259]="***312. “He whom you call a young man, O great king, is no common man, O best of heroes; if you have ever heard of the Yakkha Puṇṇaka, it was he, the minister of king Kuvera.*";
P_HTM[1260]="***313. There is a Nāga king named Varuṇa, mighty, endowed with strength and a noble presence, now Puṇṇaka loves his younger daughter, the Nāga maiden Irandatī.*";
P_HTM[1261]="***314. He laid his plan for my death for the sake of that fair maiden whom he loved, he thus obtained his wife, and I was allowed to depart and the jewel was won.”*";
P_HTM[1262]="***The Nāga king, being pleased with my solution of his question as to the four ends of men, paid me the honour of giving me a jewel; and when he returned to the Nāga world, his queen Vimalā asked him where the jewel was. He described my skill in discoursing concerning the Dhamma, and she, being desirous of hearing such a discourse, feigned a longing for my heart. The Nāga king, not understanding her real wish, said to his daughter Irandatī, “Your mother has a longing for Vidhura’s heart, find out a noble who is able to bring it for her.” As she was seeking one, she saw the Yakkha Puṇṇaka who was the son of Vessavaṇa’s sister, and, as she knew that he was in love with her, she sent him to her father, who said to him, “If you are able to bring me Vidhura’s heart you shall obtain her.”*";
P_HTM[1263]="***So he, having brought from the mountain Vepulla the gem which might well belong to a Universal Monarch, played dice with me and having won me by his play he remained three days in my house. Then he made me lay hold of his horse’s tail, and dashed me against the trees and mountains in the Himālayas, but he could not kill me. Then he rushed forward on a whirlwind in the seventh sphere of the winds and he set me on the top of the Black Mountain sixty leagues high; there he assailed me as a lion and in other shapes, but he could not kill me. Then at last at his request I told him how I could be killed.*";
P_HTM[1264]="***Then I proceeded to tell him the duties of the good man, and when he heard them he was highly pleased and wished to bring me here. Then I took him and went to the Nāga world and I told the Dhamma to the king and to Vimalā, and all the court was highly pleased; and after I had stayed there six days the king gave Irandatī to Puṇṇaka. He was delighted when he gained her, and honoured me with many jewels as his present.*";
P_HTM[1265]="***Then at the king’s command he mounted me on a magic horse created by his will, and seating himself in the middle seat and Irandatī behind, he brought me here and put me down in the middle of the court, and then went away with Irandatī to his own city.*";
P_HTM[1266]="***Thus, O king, for the sake of that fair maiden whom he loved he laid his plan for my death and thus through me he obtained his wife. When the king had heard my discourse on the Dhamma, he was pleased and let me depart and I received from Puṇṇaka this jewel which grants all desires and which is worthy of a universal emperor; accept it, O monarch,” and so saying he gave the jewel to the king. Then the king, in the morning, being desirous to tell the citizens the dream which he had seen, related to them the history as follows:*";
P_HTM[1267]="***315. “There grew a tree before my gates, its trunk was wisdom and its boughs the moral virtues; it ripened into all that was natural and developed, its fruits were the five products of the cow, and it was covered with elephants and cattle.*";
P_HTM[1268]="***316. But while it resounded with dance, song, and musical instruments a man came and cut it up from the roots and carried it away; it then came to this palace of ours, pay your homage to this tree.*";
P_HTM[1269]="***317. Let all who are joyful by my means show it today by their actions; bring your presents in abundance, and pay your homage to this tree.*";
P_HTM[1270]="***318. Whatever captives there may be in my realm, let them set them all loose from their captivity; as this tree has been delivered from its captivity, so let them release others from bondage.*";
P_HTM[1271]="***319. Let them spend this month on holiday, hanging up their ploughs; let them feast the brahmins with flesh and rice; let them drink in private, and still seem total abstainers, with their full cups flowing over.*";
P_HTM[1272]="***320. Let them invite their friends on the highway, and keep a strict watch in the kingdom so that none may injure his neighbour, pay your homage to this tree.”*";
P_HTM[1273]="***When he had thus spoken,*";
P_HTM[1274]="***321. “The queens, the princes, the vesiyas, and the brahmins brought to the sage much food and drink.*";
P_HTM[1275]="***322. Riders on elephants, body-guards, riders in chariots, foot-soldiers, brought to the sage much food and drink.*";
P_HTM[1276]="***323. The people of the country and the city gathered together in crowds brought to the sage much food and drink.*";
P_HTM[1277]="***324. The vast assembly were filled with joy, beholding the seer after he had come: when the sage had come a triumphant waving of cloths took place.”*";
P_HTM[1278]="***After a month the festival came to an end: the Great Being, as fulfilling a Buddha’s duties, taught the great assembly the Dhamma, counselled the king and so fulfilled his span of life and so became destined for heaven. Abiding in his teaching, and following their king all the inhabitants of the Kuru kingdom gave gifts and performed good works and at the end of their lives went to swell the hosts of heaven.*";
P_HTM[1279]="***The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, said: “Not only now but formerly also did the Tathāgata, having wisdom, show himself skilful in means.” Then he identified the Jātaka, “At that time the sage’s father and mother were the royal family, the eldest queen was Rāhula’s mother, the eldest son was Rāhula, Varuṇa the Nāga king was Sāriputta, the Garuḷa king was Moggallāna, Sakka was Anuruddha, the king Dhanañjaya was Ānanda, and the wise Vidhura was myself.”*";
P_HTM[1280]="* 9. Vidhurajātakavaṇṇanā** The Story about the Great Tunnel (Mahānipāta)*";
P_HTM[1281]="***“King Brahmadatta of Pañcāla.” The Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told this about the Perfection of Wisdom.*";
P_HTM[1282]="***One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata’s Perfection of Wisdom, “Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.” The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, “Not only now is the Tathāgata wise, in the past also, before his knowledge was fully mature, he was full of all wisdom, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,” and then he told a story of the past.*";
P_HTM[1283]="***Mahosadha’s Birth*";
P_HTM[1284]="***In the past a king named Vedeha ruled in Mithilā, and he had four sages who instructed him in the Dhamma, named Senaka, Pukkusa, Kāvinda, and Devinda. Now when the Bodhisatta was conceived in his mother’s womb the king saw at dawn the following dream: four columns of fire blazed up in the four corners of the royal court as high as the great wall, and in the midst of them rose a flame of the size of a fire-fly, and at that moment it suddenly exceeded the four columns of fire and rose up as high as the Brahmā Realm and illumined the whole world; even a grain of mustard-seed lying on the ground is distinctly seen. The world of men with the world of gods worshipped it with garlands and incense; a vast multitude passed through this flame but not even a hair of their skin was singed. The king when he saw this vision started up in terror and sat pondering what was going to happen, and waited for the dawn.*";
P_HTM[1285]="***The four wise men also when they came in the morning asked him whether he had slept well. “How could I sleep well,” he replied, “when I have seen such a dream.” Then the wise Senaka replied, “Fear not, O king, it is an auspicious dream, you will be prosperous,” and when he was asked to explain, he went on, “O king, a fifth sage will be born who will surpass us four; we four are like the four columns of fire, but in the midst of us there will arise as it were a fifth column of fire, one who is unparalleled and fills a post which is unequalled in the world of gods or of men.” “Where is he at this moment?” “O king, he will either assume a body or come out of his mother’s womb,” thus did he by his science speak about what he had seen by his divine eye and the king from that time forward remembered his words.*";
P_HTM[1286]="***Now at the four gates of Mithilā there were four market towns, called the east town, the south town, the west town, and the north town; and in the east town there dwelt a certain rich man named Sirivaḍḍhaka, and his wife was named Sumanādevī. Now on that day when the king saw the vision, the Great Being went from the heaven of the Thirty-Three and was conceived in her womb; and a thousand other Devaputtas went from that heaven and were conceived in the families of various wealthy merchants in that village, and at the end of the tenth month the lady Sumanā brought forth a child of the colour of gold.*";
P_HTM[1287]="***Now at that moment Sakka, as he looked over the world of mankind, beheld the Great Being’s birth; and saying to himself that he ought to make known in the world of gods and men that this Buddha-shoot had sprung into being, he came up in a visible form as the child was being born and placed a piece of a medicinal herb in its hand, and then returned to his own dwelling. The Great Being seized it firmly in his closed hand; and as he came from his mother’s womb she did not feel the slightest pain, but he passed out as easily as water from a sacred waterpot. When his mother saw the piece of the medicinal herb in his hand, she said to him, “My child, what is this which you have got?” He replied, “It is a medicinal plant, mother,” and he placed it in her hand and told her to take it and give it to all who are afflicted with any sickness.*";
P_HTM[1288]="***Full of joy she told it to the merchant Sirivaḍḍhaka, who had suffered for seven years from a pain in his head. Full of joy he said to himself, “This child came out of his mother’s womb holding a medicinal plant and as soon as he was born he talked with his mother; a medicine given by a being of such surpassing merit must possess great efficacy,” so he rubbed it on a grindstone and smeared a little of it on his forehead, and the pain in his head which had lasted seven years passed away at once like water from a lotus leaf. Transported with joy he exclaimed, “This is a medicine of marvellous efficacy,” the news spread on every side that the Great Being had been born with a medicine in his hand, and all who were sick crowded to the merchant’s house and begged for the medicine. They gave a little to all who came, having rubbed some of it on a grindstone and mixed it with water, and as soon as the affected body was touched with the divine medicine all diseases were cured, and the delighted patients went away proclaiming the marvellous virtues of the medicine in the house of the merchant Sirivaḍḍhaka.*";
P_HTM[1289]="***On the day of naming the child the merchant thought to himself, “My child need not be called after one of his ancestors; let him bear the name of the medicine,” so he gave him the name Osadhakumāra. Then he thought again, “My son possesses great merit, he will not be born alone, many other children will be born at the same time,” so hearing from his inquiries that thousands of other boys were born with him, he sent them all nurses and gave them clothes, and resolving that they should be his son’s attendants he celebrated a festival for them with the Great Being and adorned the boys and brought them every day to wait upon him. The Great Being grew up playing with them, and when he was seven years old he was as beautiful as a golden statue.*";
P_HTM[1290]="***As he was playing with them in the village some elephants and other animals passed by and disturbed their games, and sometimes the children were distressed by the rain and the heat.*";
P_HTM[1291]="***Now one day as they played, an unseasonable rainstorm came on, and when the Great Being who was as strong as an elephant saw it, he ran into a house, and as the other children ran after him they fell over one another’s feet and bruised their knees and other limbs. Then he thought to himself, “A hall for play ought to be built here, we will not play in this way,” and he said to the boys: “Let us build a hall here where we can stand, sit, or lie in time of wind, hot sunshine, or rain, let each one of you bring his piece of money.” The thousand boys all did so and the Great Being sent for a master-carpenter and gave him the money, telling him to build a hall in that place. He took the money, and levelled the ground and cut posts and spread out the measuring line, but he did not grasp the Great Being’s idea; so he told the carpenter how he was to stretch out his line so as to do it properly. He replied, “I have stretched it out according to my practical experience, I cannot do it in any other way.” “If you do not know even so much as this how can you take our money and build a hall? Take the line, I will measure and show you,” so he made him take the line and himself drew out the plan, and it was done as if the Devaputta Vissakamma had done it. Then he said to the carpenter, “Will you be able to draw out the plan in this way?” “I shall not be able, sir.” “Will you be able to do it by my instructions?” “I shall be able, sir.”*";
P_HTM[1292]="***Then the Great Being so arranged the hall that there was in one part a place for ordinary strangers, in another a lodging for the destitute, in another a place for the lying-in of destitute women, in another a lodging for stranger ascetics and brahmins, in another a lodging for other sorts of men, in another a place where foreign merchants should stow their goods, and all these apartments had doors opening outside.*";
P_HTM[1293]="***There also he had a public place erected for sports, and a court of justice, and a hall for monastic assemblies. When the work was completed he summoned painters, and having himself examined them set them to work at painting beautiful pictures, so that the hall became like Sakka’s heavenly palace Sudhammā. Still he thought that the palace was not yet complete, “I must have a tank constructed as well,” so he ordered the ground to be dug for an architect and having discussed it with him and given him money he made him construct a tank with a thousand bends in the bank and a hundred bathing places. The water was covered with the five kinds of lotuses and was as beautiful as the lake in the heavenly garden Nandana. On its bank he planted various trees and had a park made like Nandana. And near this hall he established a public distribution of alms to holy men whether ascetics or brahmins, and for strangers and for people from the neighbouring villages.*";
P_HTM[1294]="***These actions of his were blazed abroad everywhere and crowds gathered to the place, and the Great Being used to sit in the hall and discuss the right and the wrong of the good or evil circumstances of all the petitioners who resorted there and gave his judgment on each, and it became like the happy time when a Buddha makes his appearance in the world.*";
P_HTM[1295]="***Now at that time, when seven years had expired, king Vedeha remembered how the four sages had said that a fifth sage should be born who would surpass them in wisdom, and he said to himself, “Where is he now?” and he sent out his four councillors by the four gates of the city, bidding them to find out where he was. When they went out by the other three gates they saw no sign of the Great Being, but when they went out by the eastern gate they saw the hall and its various buildings and they felt sure at once that only a wise man could have built this palace or caused it to be built, and they asked the people, “What architect built this hall?” They replied, “This palace was not built by any architect by his own power, but by the direction of the wise Mahosadha, the son of the merchant Sirivaḍḍha.” “How old is he?” “He has just completed his seventh year.” The councillor reckoned up all the events from the day on which the king saw the dream and he said to himself, “This being fulfils the king’s dream,” and he sent a messenger with this message to the king, “Mahosadha, the son of the merchant Sirivaḍḍha in the east market town, who is now seven years old, has caused such a hall and tank and park to be made, shall I bring him into your presence or not?”*";
P_HTM[1296]="***The Nineteen Problems*";
P_HTM[1297]="***When the king heard this he was highly delighted and sent for Senaka, and after relating the account he asked him whether he should send for this sage. But he, being envious of the title, replied, “O king, a man is not to be called a sage merely because he has caused halls and such things to be made; anyone can cause these things to be made, this is but a little matter.” When the king heard his words he said to himself, “There must be some secret reason for all this,” and was silent. Then he sent back the messenger with a command that the councillor should remain for a time in the place and carefully examine the sage. The councillor remained there and carefully investigated the sage’s actions, and this is the series of the tests or cases of examination:*";
P_HTM[1298]="***1. “Meat, cattle, necklace, thread, son, ball and a chariot,*";
P_HTM[1299]="***Pole, head and also the snake, chicken, gem, the calving,*";
P_HTM[1300]="***Rice and also sand, the tank, the park, the ass, the jewel.”*";
P_HTM[1301]="***1. “The piece of meat.” One day when the Great Being was going to the play-hall, a hawk carried off a piece of flesh from the slab of a slaughterhouse and flew up into the air; some lads, seeing it, determined to make him drop it and pursued him. The hawk flew in different directions, and they, looking up, followed behind and wearied themselves, flinging stones and other missiles and stumbling over one another. Then the sage said to them, “I will make him drop it,” and they begged him to do so. He told them to look; and then himself with looking up he ran with the swiftness of the wind and trod upon the hawk’s shadow and then clapping his hands uttered a loud shout. By his energy that shout seemed to pierce the bird’s belly through and through and in its terror he dropped the flesh; and the Great Being, knowing by watching the shadow that it was dropped, caught it in the air before it reached the ground. The people seeing the marvel, made a great noise, shouting and clapping their hands.*";
P_HTM[1302]="***The minister, hearing of it, sent an account to the king telling him how the sage had by this means made the bird drop the flesh. The king, when he heard of it, asked Senaka whether he should summon him to the court. Senaka reflected: “From the time of his coming I shall lose all my glory and the king will forget my existence, I must not let him bring him here,” so in envy he said: “He is not a sage for such an action as this, this is only a small matter,” and the king being impartial, sent word that the minister should test him further where he was.*";
P_HTM[1303]="***2. “The cattle.” A certain man who dwelt in the village of Yavamajjhaka bought some cattle from another village and brought them home. The next day he took them to a field of grass to graze and rode on the back of one of the cattle. Being tired he got down and sat on the ground and fell asleep, and meanwhile a thief came and carried off the cattle. When he woke he saw not his cattle, but as he gazed on every side he beheld the thief running away. Jumping up he shouted, “Where are you taking my cattle?” “They are my cattle, and I am carrying them to the place which I wish.” A great crowd collected as they heard the dispute.*";
P_HTM[1304]="***When the sage heard the noise as they passed by the door of the hall, he sent for them both. When he saw their behaviour he at once knew which was the thief and which the real owner. But though he felt sure, he asked them what they were quarrelling about. The owner said: “I bought these cattle from a certain person in such a village, and I brought them home and put them in a field of grass. This thief saw that I was not watching and came and carried them off. Looking in all directions I caught sight of him and pursued and caught him. The people of such a village know that I bought the cattle and took them.” The thief replied, “This man speaks falsely, they were born in my house.” The sage said: “I will decide your case fairly; will you abide by my decision?” and they promised so to abide. Then thinking to himself that he must win the hearts of the people he first asked the thief, “What have you fed these cattle with, and what have you given them to drink?” “They have drunk rice gruel and have been fed on sesame flour and kidney beans.” Then he asked the real owner, who said: “My lord, how could a poor man like me get rice gruel and the rest? I fed them on grass.”*";
P_HTM[1305]="***The wise man caused an assembly to be brought together and ordered panic seeds to be brought and ground in a mortar and moistened with water and given to the cattle, and they forthwith vomited only grass. He showed this to the assembly, and then asked the thief, “Are you the thief or not?” He confessed that he was the thief. He said to him, “Then do not wrong henceforth.” But the Bodhisatta’s attendants carried the man away and cut off his hands and feet and made him helpless. Then the sage addressed him with words of good counsel: “This suffering has come upon you only in this present life, but in the future life you will suffer great torment in the different hells, therefore henceforth abandon such practices,” he taught him the Five Precepts.*";
P_HTM[1306]="***The minister sent an account of the incident to the king, who asked Senaka, but he advised him to wait, “It is only an affair about cattle and anybody could decide it.” The king, being impartial, sent the same command. (This is to be understood in all the subsequent cases, we shall give each in order according to the list.)*";
P_HTM[1307]="***3. “The necklace of thread.” A certain poor woman had tied together several threads of different colours and made them into a necklace, which she took off from her neck and placed on her clothes as she went down to bathe in a tank which the wise man had caused to be made. A young woman who saw this conceived a longing for it, took it up and said to her, “Mother, this is a very beautiful necklace, how much did it cost to make? I will make such a one for myself. May I put it on my own neck and ascertain its size?” The other gave her leave, and she put it on her neck and ran off. The elder woman seeing it came quickly out of the water, and putting on her clothes ran after her and seized hold of her dress, crying, “You are running away with a necklace which I made.” The other replied, “I am not taking anything of yours, it is the necklace which I wear on my neck,” and a great crowd collected as they heard this.*";
P_HTM[1308]="***The sage, while he played with the boys, heard them quarrelling as they passed by the door of the hall and asked what the noise was about. When he heard the cause of the quarrel he sent for them both, and having known at once by her countenance which was the thief, he asked them whether they would abide by his decision. On their both agreeing to do so, he asked the thief, “What scent do you use for this necklace?” She replied, “I always use sabbasaṁhāraka to scent it with.” Then he asked the other, who replied, “How shall a poor woman like me get sabbasaṁhāraka? I always scent it with perfume made of piyaṅgu flowers.” Then the sage had a vessel of water brought and put the necklace in it. Then he sent for a perfume-seller and told him to smell the vessel and find out what it smelt of. He directly recognised the smell of the piyaṅgu flower, and quoted the verse which has already been given in the first book:*";
P_HTM[1309]="***2. “No perfume collection it is; only the poor piyaṅgu smells;*";
P_HTM[1310]="***That wicked woman told a lie; the truth the village woman tells.”*";
P_HTM[1311]="***The Great Being told the bystanders all the circumstances and asked each of them respectively, “Are you the thief? Are you not the thief?” and made the guilty one confess, and from that time his wisdom became known to the people.*";
P_HTM[1312]="***4. “The cotton thread.” A certain woman who used to watch cotton fields was watching one day and she took some clean cotton and spun some fine thread and made it into a ball and placed it in her lap. As she went home she thought to herself, “I will bathe in the great sage’s tank,” so she placed the ball on her dress and went down into the tank to bathe. Another woman saw it, and conceiving a longing for it took it up, saying: “This is a beautiful ball of thread; pray did you make it yourself?” So she lightly snapped her fingers and put it in her lap as if to examine it more closely, and walked off with it. (This is to be told at full as before.) The sage asked the thief, “When you made the ball what did you put inside?” She replied, “A cotton seed.” Then he asked the other, and she replied, “A timbaru seed.” When the crowd had heard what each said, he untwisted the ball of cotton and found a timbaru seed inside and forced the thief to confess her guilt. The great multitude were highly pleased and shouted their applause at the way in which the case had been decided.*";
P_HTM[1313]="***5. “The son.” A certain woman took her son and went down to the sage’s tank to wash her face. After she had bathed her son she laid him in her dress and having washed her own face went to bathe. At that moment a Yakkhini saw the child and wished to eat it, so she took hold of the dress and said: “My friend, this is a fine child, is he your son?” Then she asked if she might give him suck, and on obtaining the mother’s consent, she took him and played with him for a while and then tried to run off with him. The other ran after her and seized hold of her, shouting, “Whither are you carrying my child?” The Yakkhini replied, “Why do you touch the child? He is mine.”*";
P_HTM[1314]="***As they wrangled they passed by the door of the hall, and the sage, hearing the noise, sent for them and asked what was the matter. When he heard the story, although he knew at once by her red unwinking eyes that one of them was a Yakkhini, he asked them whether they would abide by his decision. On their promising to do so, he drew a line and laid the child in the middle of the line and bade the Yakkhini seize the child by the hands and the mother by the feet. Then he said to them, “Lay hold of it and pull; the child is hers who can pull it over.” They both pulled, and the child, being pained while it was pulled, uttered a loud cry. Then the mother, with a heart which seemed ready to burst, let the child go and stood weeping.*";
P_HTM[1315]="***The sage asked the multitude, “Is it the heart of the mother which is tender towards the child or the heart of her who is not the mother?” They answered, “The mother’s heart.” “Is she the mother who kept hold of the child or she who let it go?” They replied, “She who let it go.” “Do you know who she is who stole the child?” “We do not know, O sage.” “She is a Yakkhini, she seized it in order to eat it.” When they asked how he knew that he replied, “I knew her by her unwinking red eyes and by her casting no shadow and by her fearlessness and want of mercy.” Then he asked her what she was, and she confessed that she was a Yakkhini. “Why did you seize the child?” “To eat it.” “You blind fool,” he said, “you did wrong in old time and so were born as a Yakkhini; and now you still go on doing wrong, blind fool that you are.” Then he exhorted her and established her in the five precepts and sent her away; and the mother blessed him, and saying: “May you live long, my lord,” took her son and went her way.*";
P_HTM[1316]="***6. “The black ball.” There was a certain man who was called Goḷakāḷa, now he got the name goḷa “ball” from his dwarfish size, and kāḷa from his black colour. He worked in a certain house for seven years and obtained a wife, and she was named Dīghatālā [Long Hand]. One day he said to her, “Wife, cook some sweetmeats and food, we will pay a visit to your parents.” At first she opposed the plan, saying: “What have I to do with parents now?” But after the third time of asking he induced her to cook some cakes, and having taken some provisions and a present he set out on the journey with her. In the course of the journey he came to a stream which was not really deep, but they, being both afraid of water, dared not cross it and stood on the bank.*";
P_HTM[1317]="***Now a poor man named Dīghapiṭṭhi [Long Back] came to that place as he walked along the bank, and when they saw him they asked him whether the river was deep or shallow. Seeing that they were afraid of the water he told them that it was very deep and full of voracious fish. “How then will you go across it?” “I have struck up a friendship with the crocodiles and monsters that live here, and therefore they do not hurt me.” “Do take us with you,” they said. When he consented they gave him some meat and drink; and when he finished his meal he asked them which he should carry over first. “Take your sister first and then take me,” said Goḷakāḷa. Then the man placed her on his shoulders and took the provisions and the present and went down into the stream. When he had gone a little way, he crouched down and walked along in a bent posture. Goḷakāḷa, as he stood on the bank, thought to himself, “This stream must indeed be very deep; if it is so difficult for even such a man as Dīghapiṭṭhi, it must be impassable for me.”*";
P_HTM[1318]="***When the other had carried the woman to the middle of the stream, he said to her, “Lady, I will cherish you, and you shall live bravely arrayed with fine dresses and ornaments and men-servants and maidservants; what will this poor dwarf do for you? Listen to what I tell you.” She listened to his words and ceased to love her husband, and being at once infatuated with the stranger, she consented, saying: “If you will not abandon me, I will do as you say.” So when they reached the opposite bank, they amused themselves and left Goḷakāḷa, bidding him stay where he was. While he stood there looking on, they ate up the meat and drink and departed. When he saw it, he exclaimed, “They have struck up a friendship and are running away, leaving me here.” As he ran backwards and forwards he went a little way into the water and then drew back again in fear, and then in his anger at their conduct, he made a desperate leap, saying: “Let me live or die,” and when once fairly in, he discovered how shallow the water was.*";
P_HTM[1319]="***So he crossed it and pursued him and shouted, “You wicked thief, whither are you carrying my wife?” The other replied, “How is she your wife? She is mine,” and he seized him by the neck and whirled him round and threw him off. The other laid hold of Dīghatālā’s hand and shouted, “Stop, where are you going? You are my wife whom I got after working for seven years in a house,” and as he thus disputed he came near the hall.*";
P_HTM[1320]="***A great crowd collected. The Great Being asked what the noise was about, and having sent for them and heard what each said he asked whether they would abide by his decision. On their both agreeing to do so, he sent for Dīghapiṭṭhi and asked him his name. Then he asked his wife’s name, but he, not knowing what it was, mentioned some other name. Then he asked him the names of his parents and he told them, but when he asked him the names of his wife’s parents he, not knowing, mentioned some other names. The Great Being put his story together and had him removed.*";
P_HTM[1321]="***Then he sent for the other and asked him the names of all in the same way. He, knowing the truth, gave them correctly. Then he had him removed and sent for Dīghatālā and asked her what her name was and she gave it. Then he asked her her husband’s name and she, not knowing, gave a wrong name. Then he asked her her parents’ names and she gave them correctly, but when he asked her the names of her husband’s parents’ names, she talked at random and gave wrong names. Then the sage sent for the other two and asked the multitude, “Does the woman’s story agree with Dīghapiṭṭhi or Goḷakāḷa.” They replied, “With Goḷakāḷa.” Then he pronounced his sentence, “This man is her husband, the other is a thief,” and when he asked him he made him confess that he had acted as the thief.*";
P_HTM[1322]="***7. “The chariot.” A certain man, who was sitting in a chariot, alighted from it to wash his face. At that moment Sakka was considering and as he beheld the sage he resolved that he would make known the power and wisdom of Mahosadha, the embryo Buddha. So he came down in the form of a man, and followed the chariot holding on behind. The man who sat in the chariot asked, “Why have you come?” He replied, “To serve you.” The man agreed, and dismounting from the chariot went aside for a call of nature. Immediately Sakka mounted in the chariot and went off at speed. The owner of the chariot, his business done, returned; and when he saw Sakka hurrying away with the chariot, he ran quickly behind, crying, “Stop, stop, where are you taking my chariot?” Sakka replied, “Your chariot must be another, this is mine.” Thus wrangling they came to the gate of the hall.*";
P_HTM[1323]="***The sage asked, “What is this?” and sent for him: as he came, by his fearlessness and his eyes which winked not, the sage knew that this was Sakka and the other was the owner. Nevertheless he enquired the cause of the quarrel, and asked them, “Will you abide by my decision?” They said: “Yes.” He went on, “I will cause the chariot to be driven, and you must both hold on behind: the owner will not let go, the other will.” Then he told a man to drive the chariot, and he did so, the others holding on behind. The owner went a little way, then being unable to run further he let go, but Sakka went on running with the chariot.*";
P_HTM[1324]="***When he had recalled the chariot, the sage said to the people, “This man ran a little way and let go; the other ran out with the chariot and came back with it, yet there is not a drop of sweat on his body, no panting, he is fearless, his eyes wink not – this is Sakka, King of the Devas.” Then he asked, “Are you King of the Devas?” “Yes.” “Why did you come here?” “To spread the fame of your wisdom, O sage!” “Then,” said he, “don’t do that kind of thing again.” Now Sakka revealed his power by standing poised in the air, and praised the sage, saying: “A wise judgment is this!” So he went to his own place. Then the minister though unsummoned went to the king, and said: “O great king, thus was the Chariot Question resolved: and even Sakka was subdued by him; why do you not recognise superiority in men?”*";
P_HTM[1325]="***The king asked Senaka, “What say you, Senaka, shall we bring the sage here?” Senaka replied, “That is not all that makes a sage. Wait awhile: I will test him and find out.”*";
P_HTM[1326]="***8. “The pole.” So one day, with a view of testing the sage, they fetched an acacia pole, and cutting off about a span, they had it nicely smoothed by a turner, and sent it to the east market town, with this message, “The people of the market town have a name for wisdom. Let them find out then which end is the top and which the root of this stick. If they cannot, there is a fine of a thousand pieces.” The people gathered together but could not find it out, and they said to their foreman, “Perhaps Mahosadha the sage would know; send and ask him.” The foreman sent for the sage from his playground, and told him the matter, how they could not find it out, but perhaps he could.*";
P_HTM[1327]="***The sage thought in himself, “The king can gain nothing from knowing which is the top and which is the root; no doubt it is sent to test me.” He said: “Bring it here, my friends, I will find out.” Holding it in his hand, he knew which was the top and which the root; yet to please the heart of the people, he sent for a pot of water, and tied a string round the middle of the stick, and holding it by the end of the string he let it down to the surface of the water. The root being heavier sank first. Then he asked the people, “Is the root of a tree heavier, or the top?” “The root, wise sir!” “See then, this part sinks first, and this is therefore the root.” By this mark he distinguished the root from the top.*";
P_HTM[1328]="***The people sent it back to the king, distinguishing which was the root and which was the top. The king was pleased, and asked, who had found it out? They said: “The sage Mahosadha, son of foreman Sirivaḍḍha.” “Senaka, shall we send for him?” he asked. “Wait, my lord,” he replied, “let us try him in another way.”*";
P_HTM[1329]="***9. “The head.” One day, two heads were brought, one a woman’s and one a man’s; these were sent to be distinguished, with a fine of a thousand pieces in case of failure. The villagers could not decide and asked the Great Being. He recognised them at sight, because, they say, the sutures in a man’s head are straight, and in a woman’s head are crooked. By this mark he told which was which; and they sent back to the king. The rest is as before.*";
P_HTM[1330]="***10. “The snake.” One day a male and a female snake were brought, and sent for the villagers to decide which was which. They asked the sage, and he knew at once when he saw them; for the tail of the male snake is thick, that of the female is thin; the male snake’s head is thick, the female’s is long; the eyes of the male are big, of the female small, the head of the male is rounded, that of the female cut short. By these signs he distinguished male from female. The rest is as before.*";
P_HTM[1331]="***11. “The chicken.” One day a message was sent to the people of the east market town to this effect, “Send us a bull white all over, with horns on his legs, and a hump on the head, which utters his voice at three times unfailingly; otherwise there is a fine of a thousand pieces.” Not knowing one, they asked the sage. He said: “The king means you to send him a chicken. This creature has horns on his feet, the spurs; a hump on his head, the crest; and crowing thrice utters his voice at three times unfailingly. Then send him a chicken such as he describes.” They sent one.*";
P_HTM[1332]="***12. “The gem.” The gem which Sakka gave to king Kusa was octagonal. Its thread was broken, and no one could remove the old thread and put in a new. One day they sent this gem, with directions to take out the old thread and to put in a new; the villagers could do neither the one nor the other, and in their difficulty they told the sage. He bade them fear nothing, and asked for a lump of honey. With this he smeared the two holes in the gem, and twisting a thread of wool, he smeared the end of this also with honey, he pushed it a little way into the hole, and put it in a place where ants were passing. The ants smelling the honey came out of their hole, and eating away the old thread bit hold of the end of the woollen thread and pulled it out at the other end. When he saw that it had passed through, he bade them present it to the king, who was pleased when he heard how the thread had been put in.*";
P_HTM[1333]="***13. “The calving.” The royal bull was fed well for some months, so that his belly swelled out, his horns were washed, he was anointed with oil, and bathed with turmeric, and then they sent him to the east market town, with this message, “You have a name for wisdom. Here is the king’s royal bull, in calf; deliver him and send him back with the calf, or else there is a fine of a thousand pieces.” The villagers, perplexed what to do, applied to the sage; who thought fit to meet one question with another, and asked, “Can you find a bold man able to speak to the king?” “That is no hard matter,” they replied. So they summoned him, and the Great Being said: “Go, my good man, let your hair down loose over your shoulders, and go to the palace gate weeping and lamenting sore. Answer none but the king, only lament; and if the king sends for you to ask why you lament, say, ‘These seven days my son is in labour and cannot bring forth; O help me! Tell me how I may deliver him!’ Then the king will say, ‘What madness! This is impossible; men do not bear children.’ Then you must say, ‘If that be true, how can the people of the east market town deliver your royal bull of a calf?’ ” As he was bidden, so he did. The king asked who thought of that counter to his demand; and on hearing that it was the sage Mahosadha he was pleased.*";
P_HTM[1334]="***14. “The boiled rice.” Another day, to test the sage, this message was sent, “The people of the east market town must send us some boiled rice cooked under eight conditions, and these are: without rice, without water, without a pot, without an oven, without fire, without firewood, without being sent along a road either by woman or man. If they cannot do it, there is a fine of a thousand pieces.” The people were perplexed and applied to the sage; who said: “Be not troubled, take some broken rice, for that is not rice; snow, for that is not water; an earthen bowl, which is no pot; chop up some wood-blocks, which are no oven; kindle fire by rubbing, instead of a proper fire; take leaves instead of firewood; cook your sour rice, put it in a new vessel, press it well down, put it on the head of a eunuch, who is neither man nor woman, leave the main road and go along a footpath, and take it to the king.” They did so; and the king was pleased when he heard by whom the question had been solved.*";
P_HTM[1335]="***15. “The sand.” Another day, to test the sage, they sent this message to the villagers, “The king wishes to amuse himself in a swing, and the old rope is broken; you are to make a rope of sand, or else pay a fine of a thousand pieces.” They knew not what to do, and appealed to the sage, who saw that this was the place for a counter-question. He reassured the people; and sending for two or three clever speakers, he bade them go tell the king, “My lord, the villagers do not know whether the sand-rope is to be thick or thin; send them a bit of the old rope, a span long or four fingers; this they will look at and twist a rope of the same size.” If the king replied, “There never was sand-rope in my house,” they were to reply, “If your majesty cannot make a sand-rope, how can the villagers do so?” They did so; and the king was pleased on hearing that the sage had thought of this counter to his demand.*";
P_HTM[1336]="***16. “The tank.” Another day, the message was, “The king desires to disport himself in the water; you must send me a new tank covered with water lilies of all five kinds, otherwise there is a fine of a thousand pieces.” They told the sage, who saw that a counter to his demand was wanted. He sent for several men clever at speaking, and said to them, “Go and play in the water till your eyes are red, go to the palace door with wet hair and wet garments and your bodies all over mud, holding in your hands ropes, staves, and clods; send word to the king of your coming, and when you are admitted say to him, ‘Sire, inasmuch as your majesty has ordered the people of the east market town to send you a tank, we brought a great tank to suit your taste; but she being used to a life in the forest, no sooner saw the town with its walls, moats, and watch-towers, than she took fright and broke the ropes and went off into the forest: we pelted her with clods and beat her with sticks but could not make her come back. Give us then the old tank which your majesty is said to have brought from the forest, and we will yoke them together and bring the other back.’ The king will say, ‘I never had a tank brought in from the forest, and will never send a tank there to be yoked and bring in another!’ Then you must say, ‘If that is so, how can the villagers send you a tank?’ ” They did so; and the king was pleased to hear that the sage had thought of this.*";
P_HTM[1337]="***17. “The park.” Again on a day the king sent a message, “I wish to disport me in the park, and my park is old. The people of the east market town must send me a new park, filled with trees and flowers.” The sage reassured them as before, and sent men to speak in the same manner as above.*";
P_HTM[1338]="***18. [“The Ass.”] Then the king was pleased, and said to Senaka, “Well, Senaka, shall we send for the sage?” But he, grudging the other’s prosperity, said: “That is not all that makes a sage; wait.” On hearing this the king thought: “The sage Mahosadha was wise even as a child, and took my fancy. In all these mysterious tests and counters to his demand he has given answers like a Buddha. Yet such a wise man as this Senaka will not let me summon him to my side. What care I for Senaka? I will bring the man here.” So with a great following he set out for the village, mounted upon his royal horse.*";
P_HTM[1339]="***But as he went the horse put his foot into a hole and broke his leg; so the king turned back from that place to the town. Then Senaka entered the presence and said: “Sire, did you go to the east market town to bring the sage back?” “Yes, sir,” said the king. “Sire,” said Senaka, “you make me as one of no account. I begged you to wait awhile; but off you went in a hurry, and at the outset your royal horse broke his leg.” The king had nothing to say to this.*";
P_HTM[1340]="***Again on a day he asked Senaka, “Shall we send for the sage, Senaka?” “If so, your majesty, don’t go yourself but send a messenger, saying, ‘O sage! As I was on my way to fetch you my horse broke his leg: send us a better horse and a more excellent one.’ If he takes the first alternative he will come himself, if the second he will send his father. Then will be a problem to test him.” The king sent a messenger with this message. The sage on hearing it recognised that the king wished to see himself and his father. So he went to his father, and greeting him said: “Father, the king wishes to see you and me. You go first with a thousand merchants in attendance; and when you go, go not empty-handed, but take a sandalwood casket filled with fresh ghee. The king will speak kindly to you, and offer you a householder’s seat; take it and sit down. When you are seated, I will come; the king will speak kindly to me and offer me such another seat. Then I will look at you; take the cue and say, rising from your seat, say: ‘Son Mahosadha the wise, take this seat.’ Then the question will be ripe for solution.” He did so.*";
P_HTM[1341]="***On arriving at the palace door he caused his arrival to be made known to the king, and on the king’s invitation, he entered, and greeted the king, and stood on one side. The king spoke to him kindly, and asked where was his son, the wise Mahosadha. “Coming after me, my lord.” The king was pleased to hear of his coming, and bade the father sit in a suitable place. He found a place and sat there. Meanwhile the Great Being dressed himself in all his splendour, and attended by the thousand youths he came seated in a magnificent chariot. As he entered the town he beheld an ass by the side of a ditch, and he directed some stout fellows to fasten up the mouth of the ass so that it should make no noise, to put him in a bag and carry him on their shoulders. They did so; the Bodhisatta entered the city with his great company. The people could not praise him enough. “This,” they cried, “is the wise Mahosadha, the merchant Sirivaḍḍhaka’s son; this they say is he, who was born holding a herb of virtue in his hand; he it is who knew the answers to so many problems set to test him.”*";
P_HTM[1342]="***On arriving before the palace he sent in word of his coming. The king was pleased to hear it and said: “Let my son the wise Mahosadha make haste to come in.” So with his attendants he entered the palace and saluted the king and stood on one side. The king was delighted to see him and spoke to him very sweetly, and bade him find a fit seat and sit down. He looked at his father, and his father at this cue rose up from his seat and invited him to sit there, which he did.*";
P_HTM[1343]="***Thereupon the foolish men who were there, Senaka, Pukkusa, Kāvinda, Devinda, and others, seeing him sit there, clapped their hands and laughed loudly and cried, “This is the blind fool they call wise! He has made his father rise from his seat, and sits there himself! Wise he should not be called surely.” The king also was crestfallen. Then the Great Being said: “Why, my lord! Are you sad?” “Yes, wise sir, I am sad. I was glad to hear of you, but to see you I am not glad.” “Why so?” “Because you have made your father rise from his seat, and sit there yourself.” “What, my lord! Do you think that in all cases the sire is better than the son?” “Yes, sir.” “Did you not send word to me to bring you the better horse or the more excellent horse?” So saying he rose up and looking towards the young fellows, said: “Bring in the ass you have brought.” Placing this ass before the king he went on, “Sire, what is the price of this ass?” The king said: “If it be serviceable, it is worth eight rupees.” “But if he get a mule colt out of a thoroughbred Sindh mare, what will the price of it be?” “It will be priceless.” “Why do you say that, my lord? Have you not just said that in all cases the sire is better than the sons? By your own saying the ass is worth more than the mule colt. Now have not your wise men clapped their hands and laughed at me because they did not know that? What wisdom is this of your wise men! Where did you get them?” And in contempt for all four of them he addressed the king in this verse of the First Book:*";
P_HTM[1344]="***3. “Think you that the sire is always better than the son, O excellent king?*";
P_HTM[1345]="***Then is that creature better than the mule; the ass is the mule’s sire.”*";
P_HTM[1346]="***After this was said, he went on, “My lord, if the sire is better than the son, take my sire into your service; if the son is better than the sire, take me.” The king was delighted; and all the company cried out applauding and praising a thousand times, “Well indeed has the wise man solved the question.” There was a snapping of fingers and waving of a thousand scarves: the four were crestfallen.*";
P_HTM[1347]="***(Now no one knows better than the Bodhisatta the value of parents. If one ask then, why he did so: it was not to throw contempt on his father, but when the king sent the message, “Send the better horse or the more excellent horse,” he did thus in order to solve that problem, and to make his wisdom to be recognised, and to take the shine out of the four sages.)*";
P_HTM[1348]="***The king was pleased; and taking the golden vase filled with scented water, poured the water upon the merchant’s hand, saying: “Enjoy the east market town as a gift from the king. Let the other merchants,” he went on, “be subordinate to this.” This done he sent to the mother of the Bodhisatta all kinds of ornaments. Delighted as he was at the Bodhisatta’s solution of the Ass Question, he wished to make the Bodhisatta as his own son, and to the father said: “Good sir, give me the Great Being to be my son.” He replied, “Sire, very young is he still; even yet his mouth smells of milk: but when he is old, he shall be with you.” The king said however, “Good sir, henceforth you must give up your attachment to the boy; from this day he is my son. I can support my son, so go your ways.” Then he sent him away. He did obeisance to the king, and embraced his son, and throwing his arms about him kissed him upon the head, and gave him good counsel. The boy also bade his father farewell, and begged him not to be anxious, and sent him away.*";
P_HTM[1349]="***The king then asked the sage, whether he would take his meals inside the palace or without it. He thinking that with so large a retinue it were best to have his meals outside the palace, replied to that effect. Then the king gave him a suitable house, and providing for the maintenance of the thousand youths and all, gave him all that was needful. From that time the sage attended upon the king.*";
P_HTM[1350]="***[19. “The Jewel.”] Now the king desired to test the sage. At that time there was a precious jewel in a crow’s nest on a palm tree which stood on the bank of a lake near the southern gate, and the image of this jewel was to be seen reflected upon the lake. They told the king that there was a jewel in the lake. He sent for Senaka, saying: “They tell me there is a jewel in the lake; how are we to get it?” Senaka said: “The best way is to drain out the water.” The king instructed him to do so; and he collected a number of men, and got out the water and mud, and dug up the soil at the bottom – but no jewel could he find. But when the lake was again full, there was the reflection of the jewel to be seen once more. Again Senaka did the same thing, and found no jewel.*";
P_HTM[1351]="***Then the king sent for the sage, and said: “A jewel has been seen in the lake, and Senaka has taken out the water and mud and dug up the earth without finding it, but no sooner is the lake full than it appears again. Can you get hold of it?” He replied, “That is no hard task, sire, I will get it for you.” The king was pleased at this promise, and with a great following he went to the lake, ready to see the might of the sage’s knowledge. The Great Being stood on the bank, and looked. He perceived that the jewel was not in the lake, but must be in the tree, and he said aloud, “Sire, there is no jewel in the tank.” “What! Is it not visible in the water?” So he sent for a pail of water, and said: “Now my lord, see – is not this jewel visible both in the pail and the lake?” “Then where can the jewel be?” “Sire, it is the reflection which is visible both in the lake and in the pail, but the jewel is in a crow’s nest in this palm tree: send up a man and have it brought down.” The king did so: the man brought down the jewel, and the sage put it into the king’s hand. All the people applauded the sage and mocked at Senaka, “Here’s a precious jewel in a crow’s nest up a tree, and Senaka makes strong men dig out the lake! Surely a wise man should be like Mahosadha.” Thus they praised the Great Being; and the king being delighted with him, gave him a necklace of pearls from his own neck, and strings of pearls to the thousand boys, and to him and his retinue he granted the right to wait upon him without ceremony.*";
P_HTM[1352]="***The Chameleon Question*";
P_HTM[1353]="***Again, on a day the king went with the sage into the park; when a chameleon, which lived on the top of the arched gateway, saw the king approach and came down and lay flat upon the ground. The king seeing this asked, “What is he doing, wise sir?” “Paying respect to you, sire.” “If so, let not his service be without reward; give him a largess.” “Sire, a largess is of no use to him; all he wants is something to eat.” “And what does he eat?” “Meat, sire.” “How much ought he to have?” “A farthing’s worth, sire.” “A farthing’s worth is no gift from a king,” said the king, and he sent a man with orders to bring regularly and give to the chameleon a half-anna’s worth of meat. This was done thereafter. But on a fast day, when there is no killing, the man could find no meat; so he bored a hole through the half-anna piece, and strung it upon a thread, and tied it upon the chameleon’s neck. This made the creature proud. That day the king again went into the park; but the chameleon as he saw the king draw near, in pride of wealth made himself equal to the king, thinking within himself, “You may be very rich, Vedeha, but so am I.” So he did not come down, but lay still on the archway, stroking his head. The king seeing this said: “Wise sir, this creature does not come down today as usual; what is the reason?” And he recited the first verse:*";
P_HTM[1354]="***4. “That chameleon used not to climb upon the archway: explain, Mahosadha, why the chameleon has become stiff-necked.”*";
P_HTM[1355]="***The sage perceived that the man must have been unable to find meat on this fast day when there was no killing, and that the creature must have become proud because of the coin hung about his neck; so he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1356]="***5. “The chameleon has got what he never had before, a half-anna piece; hence he despises Vedeha lord of Mithilā.”*";
P_HTM[1357]="***The king sent for the man and questioned him, and he told him all about it truly. Then he was more than ever pleased with the sage, who (it seemed) knew the thoughts of the chameleon, without asking any questions, with a wisdom like the supreme wisdom of a Buddha; so he gave him the revenue taken at the four gates. Being angry with the chameleon, he thought of discontinuing the gift, but the sage told him that it was unfitting and dissuaded him.*";
P_HTM[1358]="***The Question of Good and Bad Luck*";
P_HTM[1359]="***Now a lad Piṅguttara living in Mithilā came to Taxila, and studied under a famous teacher, and soon completed his education; then after diligent study he proposed to take leave of his teacher and go. But in this teacher’s family there was a custom, that if there should be a daughter ripe for marriage she should be given to the eldest pupil. This teacher had a daughter beautiful as a Devaccharā, so he said: “My son, I will give you my daughter and you shall take her with you.” Now this lad was unfortunate and unlucky, but the girl was very lucky. When he saw her he did not care for her; but though he said so, he agreed, not wishing to disregard his master’s words, and the brahmin married the daughter to him. Night came, when he lay upon the prepared bed; no sooner had she got into the bed than up he got groaning and lay down upon the floor. She got out and lay beside him, then he got up and went to bed again; when she came into the bed again he got out – for ill luck cannot mate with good luck. So the girl stayed in bed and he stayed on the ground. Thus they spent seven days. Then he took leave of his teacher and departed taking her with him.*";
P_HTM[1360]="***On the road there was not so much as an exchange of talk between them. Both unhappy they came to Mithilā. Not far from the town, Piṅguttara saw a fig tree covered with fruit, and being hungry he climbed up and ate some of the figs. The girl also being hungry came to the foot of the tree and called out, “Throw down some fruit for me too.” “What!” says he, “have you no hands or feet? Climb up and get it yourself.” She climbed up also and ate. No sooner did he see that she had climbed than he came down quickly, and piled thorns around the tree, and made off saying to himself, “I have got rid of the miserable woman at last.” She could not get down, but remained sitting where she was.*";
P_HTM[1361]="***Now the king, who had been amusing himself in the forest, was coming back to town on his elephant in the evening time when he saw her, and fell in love; so he sent to ask had she a husband or no. She replied, “Yes, I have a husband to whom my family gave me; but he has gone away and left me here alone.” The courtier told this tale to the king, who said: “Treasure trove belongs to the crown.” She was brought down and placed on the elephant and conveyed to the palace, where she was sprinkled with the water of consecration as his queen consort. Dear and darling she was to him; and the name Udumbarā [Fig] was given to her because he first saw her upon a fig tree.*";
P_HTM[1362]="***One day after this, they who dwelt by the city gate had to clean the road for the king to go disporting into his park; and Piṅguttara, who had to earn his living, tucked up his clothes and set to work clearing the road with a hoe. Before the road was clean the king with queen Udumbarā came along in a chariot; and the queen seeing the wretch clearing the road could not restrain her triumph, but smiled to see the wretch there. The king was angry to see her smile, and asked why she did so. “My lord,” she said, “that road-cleaner fellow is my former husband, who made me climb up the fig tree and then piled thorns about it and left me; when I saw him I could not help feeling triumphant at my good fortune, and smiled to see the wretch there.” The king said: “You lie, you laughed at someone else, and I will kill you!” And he drew his sword. She was alarmed and said: “Sire, pray ask your wise men!” The king asked Senaka whether he believed her. “No, my lord, I do not,” said Senaka, “for who would leave such a woman if he once possessed her?” When she heard this she was more frightened than ever. But the king thought: “What does Senaka know about it? I will ask the sage,” and asked him reciting this verse:*";
P_HTM[1363]="***6. “Should a woman be virtuous and fair, and a man not desire her – do you believe it Mahosadha?”*";
P_HTM[1364]="***The sage replied:*";
P_HTM[1365]="***7. “O king, I do believe it: the man would be an unlucky wretch; good luck and ill luck never can mate together.”*";
P_HTM[1366]="***These words allayed the king’s anger, and his heart was calmed, and much pleased he said: “O wise man! If you had not been here, I should have trusted the words of that fool Senaka and lost this precious woman: you have saved me my queen.” He recompensed the sage with a thousand pieces of money. Then the queen said to the king respectfully, “Sire, it is all through this wise man that my life has been saved; grant me the boon, that I may treat him as my youngest brother.” “Yes, my queen, I consent, the boon is granted.” “Then, my lord, from this day I will eat no dainties without my brother, from this day in season and out of season my door shall be open to send him sweet food – this boon I crave.” “You may have this boon also, my lady,” said the king.*";
P_HTM[1367]="***The Question about the Goat*";
P_HTM[1368]="***Another day, the king after breakfast was walking up and down in the long walk when he saw through a doorway a goat and a dog making friends. Now this goat was in the habit of eating the grass thrown to the elephants beside their stable before they touched it; the elephant-keepers beat it and drove it away; and as it ran away bleating, one man ran quickly after and struck it on the back with a stick. The goat with its back humped in pain went and lay down by the great wall of the palace, on a bench.*";
P_HTM[1369]="***Now there was a dog which had fed all its days upon the bones, skin, and refuse of the royal kitchen. That same day the cook had finished preparing the food, and had dished it up, and while he was wiping the sweat off his body the dog could no longer bear the smell of the meat and fish, and entered the kitchen, pushed off the cover and began eating the meat. But the cook hearing the noise of the dishes ran in and saw the dog: he clapped the door to and beat the dog with sticks and stones. The dog dropped the meat from his mouth and ran off yelping; and the cook seeing him run, ran after and struck him full on the back with a stick. The dog humping his back and holding up one leg came to the place where the goat was lying.*";
P_HTM[1370]="***Then the goat said: “Friend, why do you hump your back? Are you suffering from colic?” The dog replied, “You are humping your back too, have you an attack of colic?” He told his tale. Then the goat added, “Well, can you ever go to the kitchen again?” “No, it is as much as my life’s worth. Can you go to the stable again?” “No more than you, ’tis as much as my life’s worth.” Well, they began to wonder, how they could live?*";
P_HTM[1371]="***Then the goat said: “If we could manage to live together I have an idea.” “Pray tell it.” “Well, sir, you must go to the stable; the elephant-keepers will take no notice of you, for (think they) he eats no grass; and you must bring me my grass. I will go to the kitchen, and the cook will take no notice of me, thinking that I eat no meat, so I will bring you your meat.” “That’s a good plan,” said the other, and they made a bargain of it: the dog went to the stable and brought a bundle of grass in his teeth and laid it beside the great wall; the other went to the kitchen and brought away a great lump of meat in his mouth to the same place. The dog ate the meat and the goat ate the grass; and so by this device they lived together in harmony by the great wall.*";
P_HTM[1372]="***When the king saw their friendship he thought: “Never have I seen such a thing before. Here are two natural enemies living in friendship together. I will put this in the form of a question to my wise men; those who cannot understand it I will banish from the realm, and if anyone guesses it I will declare him the sage incomparable and show him all honour. There is no time today; but tomorrow when they come to wait upon me I will ask them the question.*";
P_HTM[1373]="***So next day when the wise men had come to wait upon him, he put his question in these words:*";
P_HTM[1374]="***8. “Two natural enemies, who never before in the world could come within seven paces of each other, have become friends and go around inseparable. What is the reason?”*";
P_HTM[1375]="***After this he added another verse:*";
P_HTM[1376]="***9. “If this day before noon you cannot solve me this question, I will banish you all. I have no need of ignorant men.”*";
P_HTM[1377]="***Now Senaka was seated in the first seat, the sage in the last; and thought the sage to himself, “This king is too slow of wit to have thought out this question by himself, he must have seen something. If I can get one day’s grace I will solve the riddle. Senaka is sure to find some means to postpone it for a day.” And the other four wise men could see nothing, being like men in a dark room: Senaka looked at the Bodhisatta to see what he would do, the Bodhisatta looked at Senaka. By the way Mahosadha looked, Senaka perceived his state of mind; he saw that even this wise man does not understand the question, he cannot answer it today but wants a day’s grace; he would fulfil this wish. So he laughed loudly in a reassuring manner and said: “What, sire, you will banish us all if we cannot answer your question?” “Yes, sir.” “Ah, you know that it is a knotty question, and we cannot solve it; do but wait a little. A knotty question cannot be solved in a crowd. We will think it over, and afterwards explain it to you. So let us have a chance.” So he said relying on the Great Being, and then recited these two verses:*";
P_HTM[1378]="***10. “In a great crowd, where a great din of people are assembled, our minds are distracted, our thoughts cannot concentrate, and we cannot solve the question.*";
P_HTM[1379]="***11. But alone, calm in thought, apart they will go and ponder on the matter, in solitude grappling with it firmly, then they will solve it for you, O lord of men.”*";
P_HTM[1380]="***The king, exasperated though he was at his speech, said, threatening them, “Very well, think it over and tell me; if you do not, I will banish you.” The four wise men left the palace, and Senaka said to the others, “Friends, a delicate question this which the king has put; if we cannot solve it there is great fear for us. So take a good meal and reflect carefully.” After this they went each to his own house.*";
P_HTM[1381]="***The sage on his part rose and sought out queen Udumbarā, and to her he said: “O queen, where was the king most of today and yesterday?” “Walking up and down the long walk, good sir, and looking out of the window.” “Ah,” thought the Bodhisatta, “he must have seen something there.” So he went to the place and looked out and saw the doings of the goat and the dog. “The king’s question is solved!” he concluded, and home he went. The three others found out nothing, and came to Senaka, who asked, “Have you found out the question?” “No, master.” “If so, the king will banish you, and what will you do?” “But you have found it out?” “Indeed no, not I.” “If you cannot find it out, how can we? We roared like lions before the king, and said, ‘Let us think and we will solve it;’ and now if we cannot, he will be angry. What are we to do?” “This question is not for us to solve: no doubt the sage has solved it in a hundred ways.” “Then let us go to him.”*";
P_HTM[1382]="***So they all four came to the Bodhisatta’s door, and sent to announce their coming, and entering spoke politely to him; then standing on one side they asked the Great Being, “Well, sir, have you thought out the question?” “If I have not, who will? Of course I have.” “Then tell us too.” He thought to himself, “If I do not tell them, the king will banish them, and will honour me with the seven precious things. But let not these fools perish – I will tell them.” So he made them sit down on low seats, and to uplift their hands in salutation, and without telling them what the king had really seen, he composed four verses, and taught them one each in the Pāli language, to recite when the king should ask them, and sent them away. Next day they went to wait on the king, and sat where they were told to sit, and the king asked Senaka, “Have you solved the question, Senaka?” “Sire, if I do not know it who can?” “Tell me, then.” “Listen, my lord,” and he recited a verse as he had been taught:*";
P_HTM[1383]="***12. “Young beggars and young princes like and delight in ram’s flesh; dog’s flesh they do not eat. Yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.”*";
P_HTM[1384]="***Although Senaka recited the verse he did not know its meaning; but the king did because he had seen the thing. “Senaka has found it out,” he thought; and then turned to Pukkusa and asked him. “What? Am not I a wise man?” asked Pukkusa, and recited his verse as he had been taught:*";
P_HTM[1385]="***13. “They take off a goatskin to cover the horse’s back withal, but a dogskin they do not use for covering: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.”*";
P_HTM[1386]="***Neither did he understand the matter, but the king thought he did because he had seen the thing. Then he asked Kāvinda and he also recited his verse:*";
P_HTM[1387]="***14. “Twisted horns has a ram, the dog has none at all; one eats grass, one flesh: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.”*";
P_HTM[1388]="***“He has found it out too,” thought the king, and passed on to Devinda; who with the others recited his verse as he had been taught:*";
P_HTM[1389]="***15. “Grass and leaves both the ram eat, the dog neither grass nor leaves; the dog would take a hare or a cat: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.”*";
P_HTM[1390]="***Next the king questioned the sage, “My son, do you understand this question?” “Sire, who else can understand it from Avīci to Bhavagga, from lowest hell to the highest heaven?” “Tell me, then.” “Listen, sire,” and he made clear his knowledge of the fact by reciting these two verses:*";
P_HTM[1391]="***16. “The ram, with eight half-feet on his four feet, and eight hooves, unobserved, brings meat for the other, and he brings grass for him.*";
P_HTM[1392]="***17. The chief of Videha, the lord of men, on his terrace beheld with his own eyes the interchange of food given by each to the other, between bow-wow and full-mouth.”*";
P_HTM[1393]="***The king, not knowing that the others had their knowledge through the Bodhisatta, was delighted to think that all five had found out the riddle each by his own wisdom, and recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1394]="***18. “No small gain is it that I have men so wise in my house. A matter profound and subtle they have penetrated with noble speech, the clever men!”*";
P_HTM[1395]="***So he said to them, “One good turn deserves another,” and made his return in the following verse:*";
P_HTM[1396]="***19. “To each I give a chariot and a female mule, to each a rich village, very choice, these I give to all the wise men, delighted at their noble speech.”*";
P_HTM[1397]="***All this he gave.*";
P_HTM[1398]="***The Question of Poor and Rich*";
P_HTM[1399]="***But queen Udumbarā knew that the others had got their knowledge of the question through the sage; and thought she, “The king has given the same reward to all five, like a man who makes no difference between peas and beans. Surely my brother should have had a special reward.” So she went and asked the king, “Who discovered the riddle for you, sir?” “The five wise men, madam.” “But my lord, through whom did the four get their knowledge?” “I do not know, madam.” “Sire, what do those men know! It was the sage – who wished that these fools should not be ruined through him, and taught them the problem. Then you give the same reward to them all. That is not right; you should make a distinction for the sage.”*";
P_HTM[1400]="***The king was pleased that the sage had not revealed that they had their knowledge through him, and being desirous of giving him an exceeding great reward, he thought: “Never mind: I will ask my son another question, and when he replies, I will give him a great reward.” Thinking of this he hit on The Question of Poor and Rich.*";
P_HTM[1401]="***One day, when the five wise men had come to wait upon him, and when they were comfortably seated, the king said: “Senaka, I will ask a question.” “Do, sire.” Then he recited the first verse in the Question of Poor and Rich:*";
P_HTM[1402]="***20. “Endowed with wisdom and bereft of wealth, or wealthy and without wisdom – I ask you this question, Senaka: Which of these two do clever men call the better?”*";
P_HTM[1403]="***Now this question had been handed down from generation to generation in Senaka’s family, so he replied at once:*";
P_HTM[1404]="***21. “Verily, O king, wise men and fools, men educated or uneducated, do service to the wealthy, although they be high-born and he be base-born. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, and the wealthy is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1405]="***The king listened to this answer, then without asking the other three, he said to the sage Mahosadha who sat by:*";
P_HTM[1406]="***22. “You also I ask, lofty in wisdom, Mahosadha, who knows all the Dhamma: ‘A fool with wealth or a wise man with small store, which of the two do clever men call the better?’ ”*";
P_HTM[1407]="***Then the Great Being replied, “Hear, O king:*";
P_HTM[1408]="***23. The fool commits sinful acts, thinking: ‘In this world I am the better;’ he looks at this world and not at the next, and gets the worst of it in both. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1409]="***This said, the king looked at Senaka, “Well, you see Mahosadha says the wise man is the best.” Senaka said: “Your majesty, Mahosadha is a child; even now his mouth smells of milk. What can he know?” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1410]="***24. “Science does not give riches, nor does family or personal beauty. Look at that idiot Gorimanda greatly prospering, because Luck favours the wretch. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the wealthy is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1411]="***Hearing this the king said: “What now, Mahosadha my son?” He answered, “My lord, what does Senaka know? He is like a crow where rice is scattered, like a dog trying to lap up milk: he sees himself but sees not the stick which is ready to fall upon his head. Listen, my lord,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1412]="***25. “He that is small of wit, when he gets wealth, is intoxicated: struck by misfortune he becomes stupefied: struck by ill luck or good luck as chance may come, he writhes like a fish in the hot sun. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1413]="***“Now then, master!” said the king on hearing this. Senaka said: “My lord, what does he know? Not to speak of men, it is the fine tree full of fruit which the birds go after,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1414]="***26. “As in the forest, the birds gather from all quarters to the tree which has sweet fruit, so to the rich man who has treasure and wealth crowds flock together for their profit. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the wealthy is the better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1415]="***“Well, my son, what now?” the king asked. The sage answered, “What does that pot-belly know? Listen, my lord,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1416]="***27. “The powerful fool does not well to win treasure by violence; roar loud as he will, they drag the simpleton off to hell. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1417]="***Again the king said: “Well, Senaka?” to which Senaka replied:*";
P_HTM[1418]="***28. “Whatsoever streams pour themselves into the Ganges, all these lose name and kind. The Ganges falling into the sea, is no longer to be distinguished. So the world is devoted to wealth. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the rich is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1419]="***Again the king said: “Well, sage?” and he answered, “Hear, O king!” with a couple of verses:*";
P_HTM[1420]="***29. “This mighty ocean of which he spoke, whereinto always flow rivers innumerable, this sea beating incessantly on the shore can never pass over it, mighty ocean though it be.*";
P_HTM[1421]="***30. So it is with the chatterings of the fool: his prosperity cannot overpass the wise. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the prosperous fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1422]="***“Well, Senaka?” said the king. “Hear, O king!” said he, and recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1423]="***31. “A wealthy man in high position may lack all self-control, but if he says anything to others, his word has weight in the midst of his kinsfolk; but wisdom has not that effect for the man without wealth. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the rich is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1424]="***“Well, my son?” said the king again. “Listen, sire! What does that stupid Senaka know?” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1425]="***32. “For another’s sake or his own the fool and small of wit speaks falsely; he is put to shame in the midst of company, and hereafter he goes to misery. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1426]="***Then Senaka recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1427]="***33. “Even if one be of great wisdom, but without rice or grain, and needy, should he say anything, his word has no weight in the midst of his kinsfolk, and prosperity does not come to a man for his knowledge. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the rich is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1428]="***Again the king said: “What say you to that, my son?” And the sage replied, “What does Senaka know? He looks at this world, not the next,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1429]="***34. “Not for his own sake nor another’s does the man of great wisdom speak a lie; he is honoured in the midst of the assembly, and hereafter he goes to happiness. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1430]="***Then Senaka recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1431]="***35. “Elephants, kine, horses, jewelled earrings, women, are found in rich families; these all are for the enjoyment of the rich man without success. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the rich is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1432]="***The sage said: “What does he know?” and continuing to explain the matter he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1433]="***36. “The fool, who does thoughtless acts and speaks foolish words, the unwise, is cast off by fortune as a snake casts the old skin. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1434]="***“What now?” asked the king then; and Senaka said: “My lord, what can this little boy know? Listen!” and he recited this verse, thinking that he would silence the sage:*";
P_HTM[1435]="***37. “We are five wise men, sire, all waiting upon you with gestures of respect; and you are our lord and master, like Sakka, lord of all creatures, King of the Devas. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is mean, the rich is better.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1436]="***When the king heard this he thought: “That was neatly said of Senaka; I wonder whether my son will be able to refute it and to say something else.” So he asked him, “Well, wise sir, what now?” But this argument of Senaka’s there was none able to refute except the Bodhisatta; so the Great Being refuted it by saying: “Sire, what does this fool know? He only looks at himself and knows not the excellence of wisdom. Listen, sire,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1437]="***38. “The wealthy fool is but the slave of a wise man, when questions of this kind arise; when the sage solves it cleverly, then the fool falls into confusion. Beholding this I say: ‘The wise is better than the wealthy fool.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1438]="***As if he drew forth golden sand from the foot of Sineru, as though he brought the full moon up in the sky, so did he set forth this argument, so did the Great Being show his wisdom. Then the king said to Senaka, “Well, Senaka, cap that if you can!” But like one who had used up all the corn in his granary, he sat without answer, disturbed, grieving.*";
P_HTM[1439]="***If he could have produced another argument, even a thousand verses would not have finished this Jātaka. But when he remained without an answer, the Great Being went on with this verse in praise of wisdom, as though he poured out a deep flood:*";
P_HTM[1440]="***39. “Verily wisdom is esteemed of the good; wealth is beloved because men are devoted to enjoyment. The knowledge of the Buddhas is incomparable, and wealth never surpasses wisdom.”*";
P_HTM[1441]="***Hearing this the king was so pleased with the Great Being’s solution of the question, that he rewarded him with riches in a great shower, and recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1442]="***40. “Whatsoever I asked he has answered me, Mahosadha the only preacher of the Dhamma. A thousand kine, a bull and an elephant, and ten chariots drawn by thoroughbreds, and sixteen excellent villages, here I give you, pleased with your answer to the question.”*";
P_HTM[1443]="***The Question of Lady Amarā*";
P_HTM[1444]="***From that day the Bodhisatta’s glory was great, and queen Udumbarā managed it all. When he was sixteen she thought: “My young brother has grown up, and great is his glory; we must find a wife for him.” This she said to the king, and the king was well pleased. “Very good,” said he, “tell him.” She told him, and he agreed, and she said: “Then let us find you a bride, my son.” The Great Being thought: “I should never be satisfied if they choose me a wife; I will find one for myself.” And he said: “Madam, do not tell the king for a few days, and I will go seek a wife to suit my taste, and then I will tell you.” “Do so, my son,” she replied.*";
P_HTM[1445]="***He took leave of the queen, and went to his house, and informed his companions. Then he got by some means the outfit of a tailor, and alone went out by the northern gate into north town. Now in that place was an ancient and decayed merchant family, and in this family was a daughter, the lady Amarā, a beautiful girl, wise, and with all the marks of good luck. That morning early, this girl had set out to the place where her father was plowing, to bring him rice-gruel which she had cooked, and it so happened that she went by the same road.*";
P_HTM[1446]="***When the Great Being saw her coming he thought: “A woman with all lucky marks! If she is unwed she must be my wife.” When she beheld him she also thought: “If I could live in the house of such a man, I might restore my family.” The Great Being thought: “Whether she be wed or not I do not know: I will ask her by hand-gesture, and if she be wise she will understand.” So standing afar off he clenched his fist. She understood that he was asking whether she had a husband, and spread out her hand. Then he went up to her, and asked her name. She said: “My name is that which neither is, nor was, nor ever shall be.” “Madam, there is nothing in the world immortal, and your name must be Amarā [Immortal].” “Even so, master.” “For whom, madam, do you carry that gruel?” “For the god of old time.” “Gods of old time are one’s parents, and no doubt you mean your father.” “So it must be, master.” “What does your father do?” “He makes two out of one.” Now the making of two out of one is plowing. “He is plowing, madam.” “Even so, master.” “And where is your father plowing?” “Where those who go come not again.” “The place whence those who go come not again is the cemetery: he is plowing then near a cemetery.” “Even so, master.” “Will you come again today, madam?” “If it comes I will not come, if it comes not I will come.” “Your father, I think, madam, is plowing by a riverside, and if the flood comes you will not come, if it comes not, you will come.”*";
P_HTM[1447]="***After this interchange of talk, the lady Amarā offered him a drink of the gruel. The Great Being, thinking it ungracious to refuse, said he would like some. Then she put down the jar of gruel; and the Great Being thought: “If she offer it to me without first washing the pot and giving me water to wash my hands, I will leave her and go.” But she took up water in the pot and offered him water for washing, placed the pot empty upon the ground not in his hands, stirred up the gruel in the jar, filled the pot with it. But there was not much rice in it, and the Great Being said: “Why, madam, there is very little rice here!” “We got no water, master.” “You mean when your field was in growth, you got no water upon it.” “Even so, master.” So she kept some gruel for her father, and gave some to the Bodhisatta. He drank, and gargled his mouth, and said: “Madam, I will go to your house; kindly show me the way.” She did so by reciting a verse which is given in the First Book [Ja 112]:*";
P_HTM[1448]="***41. “By the way of the cakes and gruel, and the double-leaf tree in flower, by the hand wherewith I eat I bid you go, not by that wherewith I eat not: that is the way to the market-town, that secret path you must find.”*";
P_HTM[1449]="***The Firefly Question*";
P_HTM[1450]="***He reached the house by the way indicated; and Amarā’s mother saw him and gave him a seat. “May I offer you some gruel, master?” she asked. “Thank you, mother – sister Amarā gave me a little.” She at once recognized that he must have come on her daughter’s account.*";
P_HTM[1451]="***The Great Being, when he saw their poverty, said: “Mother, I am a tailor: have you anything to mend?” “Yes, master, but nothing to pay.” “There is no need to pay, mother; bring the things and I will mend them.” She brought him some old clothes, and each as she brought it the Bodhisatta mended. The wise man’s business always goes well, you know. He said then, “Go tell the people in the street.” She published it abroad in the village; and in one day by his tailoring the Great Being earned a thousand pieces of money. The old dame cooked him a midday meal, and in the evening asked how much she should cook. “Enough, mother, for all those who live in this house.” She cooked a quantity of rice with some curry and condiments.*";
P_HTM[1452]="***Now Amarā in the evening came back from the forest, bearing a faggot of wood upon her head and leaves on her hip. She threw down the wood before the front door and came in by the back door. Her father returned later. The Great Being ate of a tasty meal; the girl served her parents before herself eating, washed their feet and the Bodhisatta’s feet. For several days he lived there watching her. Then one day to test her, he said: “My dear Amarā, take half a measure of rice and with it make me gruel, a cake, and boiled rice.” She agreed at once; and husked the rice; with the big grains she made gruel, the middling grains she boiled, and made a cake with the little ones, adding the suitable condiments. She gave the gruel with its condiments to the Great Being; he no sooner took a mouthful of it than he felt its choice flavour thrill through him: nevertheless to test her he said: “Madam, if you don’t know how to cook why did you spoil my rice?” and spat it out on the ground. But she was not angry; only gave him the cake, saying: “If the gruel is not good eat the cake.” He did the same with that, and again rejecting the boiled rice, said: “If you don’t know how to cook why did you waste my property?” As though angry he mixed all three together and smeared them all over her body from the head downwards, and told her to sit at the door. “Very good, master,” she said, not angry at all, and did so. Finding that there was no pride in her he said: “Come here, madam.” At the first word she came.*";
P_HTM[1453]="***When the Great Being came, he had brought with him a thousand rupees and a dress in his betel-nut bag. Now he took out this dress and placed it in her hands, saying: “Madam, bathe with your companions and put on this dress and come to me.” She did so. The sage gave her parents all the money he had brought or earned, and comforted them, and took her back to the town with him. There to test her he made her sit down in the gatekeeper’s house, and telling the gatekeeper’s wife of his plans, went to his own house. Then he sent for some of his men, and said: “I have left a woman in such and such a house; take a thousand pieces of money with you and test her.” He gave them the money and sent them away. They did as they were bid. She refused, saying: “That is not worth the dust on my master’s feet.” The men came back and told the result. He sent them again, and a third time; and the fourth time he bade them drag her away by force. They did so, and when she saw the Great Being in all his glory she did not know him, but smiled and wept at the same time as she looked at him. He asked her why she did this. She replied, “Teacher, I smiled when I beheld your magnificence, and thought that this magnificence was not given you without cause, but for some good deed in a former life: see the fruit of goodness! I thought, and I smiled. But I wept to think that now you would do wrong against the property which another watched and tended, and would go to hell: in pity for that I wept.” After this test he knew her chastity, and sent her back to the same place. Putting on his tailor’s disguise, he went back to her and there spent the night.*";
P_HTM[1454]="***Next morning he repaired to the palace and told queen Udumbarā all about it; she informed the king, and adorning Amarā with all kinds of ornaments, and seated her in a great chariot, and with great honour brought her to the Great Being’s house, and made a gala day. The king sent the Bodhisatta a gift worth a thousand pieces of money: all the people of the town sent gifts from the doorkeepers onwards. Lady Amarā divided the gifts sent by the king into halves, and sent one portion back to the king; in the same way she divided all the gifts sent to her by the citizens, and returned half, thus winning the hearts of the people. From that time the Great Being lived with her in happiness, and instructed the king in things temporal and spiritual.*";
P_HTM[1455]="***One day Senaka said to the other three who had come to see him, “Friends, we are not enough for this common man’s son Mahosadha; and now he has gotten him a wife cleverer than himself. Can we find a means to make a breach between him and the king?” “What do we know, sir teacher – you must decide.” “Well, never mind, there is a way. I will steal the jewel from the royal crest; you, Pukkusa, take his golden necklace; you, Kāvinda, take his woollen robe; you, Devinda, his golden slipper.” They all four found a way to do these things. Then Senaka said: “We must now get them into the fellow’s house without his knowledge.” So Senaka put the jewel in a pot of dates and sent it by a slave girl, saying: “If anyone else wants to have this pot of dates, refuse, but give the pot and all to the people in Mahosadha’s house.” She took it and went to the sage’s house, and walked up and down crying, “D’you lack dates?” But the lady Amarā standing by the door saw this: she noticed that the girl went nowhere else, there must be something behind it; so making a sign for her servants to approach, she cried herself to the girl, “Come here, girl, I will take the dates.”*";
P_HTM[1456]="***When she came, the mistress called for her servants, but none answered, so she sent the girl to fetch them. While she was gone Amarā put her hand into the pot and found the jewel. When the girl returned Amarā asked her, “Whose servant are you, girl?” “The wise Senaka’s maid.” Then she enquired her name and her mother’s name and said: “Well, give me some dates.” “If you want it, mother, take the pot and all – I want no payment.” “You may go, then,” said Amarā, and sent her away. Then she wrote down on a leaf, “On such a day of such a month the teacher Senaka sent a jewel from the king’s crest for a present by the hand of such and such a girl.”*";
P_HTM[1457]="***Pukkusa sent the golden necklet hidden in a casket of jasmine flowers; Kāvinda sent the robe hidden in a basket of vegetables; Devinda sent the golden slipper hidden in a bundle of straw. She received them all and put down names and all on a leaf, which she put away, telling the Great Being about it. Then those four men went to the palace, and said: “Why, my lord! Won’t you wear your jewelled crest?” “Yes, I will – fetch it,” said the king. But they could not find the jewel or the other things. Then the four said: “My lord, your ornaments are in Mahosadha’s house, and he uses them: that common man’s son is your enemy!” So they slandered him.*";
P_HTM[1458]="***Then his well-wishers went and told Mahosadha; and he said: “I will go to the king and find out.” He waited upon the king, who was angry and said: “I know him not! What does he want here?” He would not grant him an audience. When the sage learned that the king was angry he returned home. The king sent to seize him; which the sage hearing from well-wishers indicated to Amarā that it was time he departed. So he escaped out of the city in disguise to south town where he plied the trade of a potter in a potter’s house. All the city was full of the news that he had run away. Senaka and the other three hearing that he was gone, each unknown to the rest sent a letter to the lady Amarā, to this effect, “Never mind: are we not wise men?” She took all four letters, and answered to each that he should come at such a time.*";
P_HTM[1459]="***When they came, she had them clean shaven with razors, and threw them into the outhouse, and tormented them sore, and wrapping them up in rolls of matting sent word to the king. Taking them and the four precious things together she went to the king’s courtyard and there greeting him said: “My lord, the wise Mahosadha is no thief; here are the thieves. Senaka stole the jewel, Pukkusa stole the golden necklace, Devinda stole the golden slipper: on such a day of such a month by the hand of such and such a slave girl these four were sent as presents. Look at this leaf. Take what is yours, and cast out the thieves.” And thus heaping contumely on these four persons she returned home. But the king was perplexed about this, and since the Bodhisatta had gone and there were no other wise men he said nothing, but told them to bathe and go home.*";
P_HTM[1460]="***Now the deity that dwelt in the royal parasol no longer hearing the voice of the Bodhisatta’s discourse wondered what might be the cause, and when she had found it out determined to bring the sage back. So at night she appeared through a hole in the circuit of the parasol, and asked the king four questions which are found in the Questions of the Goddess, Book IV, the verses beginning, “He strikes with hands and feet.” The king could not answer, and said so, but offered to ask his wise men, asking a day’s delay.*";
P_HTM[1461]="***Next day he sent a message summoning them, but they replied, “We are ashamed to show ourselves in the street, shaven as we are.” So he sent them four skullcaps to wear on their heads. (That is the origin of these caps, so they say.) Then they came, and sat where they were invited to go, and the king said: “Senaka, last night the deity that dwells in my parasol asked me four questions, which I could not solve but I said I would ask my wise men. Pray solve them for me.” And then he recited the first verse:*";
P_HTM[1462]="***42. “He strikes with hands and feet, and beats on the face; yet, O king, he is dear, and grows dearer than a husband.”*";
P_HTM[1463]="***Senaka stammered out whatever came first, “Strikes how, strikes whom,” and could make neither head nor tail of it; the others were all dumb. The king was full of distress. When again at night the Devatā asked whether he had found out the riddle, he said: “I asked my four wise men, and not even they could say.” She replied, “What do they know? Save wise Mahosadha there is none can solve it. If you do not send for him and get him to solve these questions, I will cleave your head with this fiery blade.” After thus frightening him she went on, “O king, when you want fire don’t blow on a firefly, and when you want milk don’t milk a horn.” Then she repeated the Firefly Question [Ja 364] of the Fifth Book:*";
P_HTM[1464]="***43. “When light is extinguished, who that goes in search of fire ever thinks a firefly to be fire, if he sees it at night?*";
P_HTM[1465]="***44. If he crumbles over it cow-dung and grass, it is a foolish idea; he cannot make it burn.*";
P_HTM[1466]="***45. So also a beast gets no benefit by wrong means, if it milks a cow by the horn where milk will not flow.*";
P_HTM[1467]="***46. By many means men obtain benefit, by punishment of enemies and kindness shown to friends.*";
P_HTM[1468]="***47. By winning over the chiefs of the army, and by the counsel of friends, the lords of the earth possess the earth and the fulness thereof.*";
P_HTM[1469]="***They are not like you, blowing at a firefly in the belief that it is a fire: you are like one blowing at a firefly when fire is at hand, like one who throws down the balance and weighs with the hand, like one who wants milk and milks the horn, when you ask deep questions of Senaka and the like of him. What do they know? Like fireflies are they, like a great flaming fire is Mahosadha blazing with wisdom. If you do not find out this question, you are a dead man.” Having thus terrified the king, she disappeared.*";
P_HTM[1470]="***The Story about the Profound Question*";
P_HTM[1471]="***Hereat the king, smitten with mortal fear, sent out the next day four of his courtiers, with orders to mount each in a chariot, and to go forth from the four gates of the city, and wheresoever they should find his son, the wise Mahosadha, to show him all honour and speedily to bring him back. Three of these found not the sage; but the fourth who went out by south gate found the Great Being in the south town, who, after fetching clay and turning his master’s wheel, sat all clay-besmeared on a bundle of straw eating balls of rice dipped in a little soup. Now the reason why he did so was this: he thought that the king might suspect him of desiring to grasp the sovereign power, but if he heard that he was living by the craft of a potter this suspicion would be put away. When he perceived the courtier he knew that the man had come for himself; he understood that his prosperity would be restored, and he should eat all manner of choice food prepared by the lady Amarā: so he dropped the ball of rice which he held, stood up, and rinsed his mouth. At that moment up came the courtier: now this was one of Senaka’s faction, so he addressed him rudely as follows, “Wise Teacher, what Senaka said was useful information. Your prosperity gone, all your wisdom was unavailing; and now there you sit all besmeared with clay on a truss of straw, eating food like that!” and he recited this verse from the Bhūripañha or Question of Wisdom [Ja 452], Book X:*";
P_HTM[1472]="***48. “Is it true, as they say, that you are one of profound wisdom? So great prosperity, cleverness, and intelligence does not serve you, thus brought to insignificance, while you eat a little soup like that.”*";
P_HTM[1473]="***Then the Great Being said: “Blind fool! By power of my wisdom when I want to restore that prosperity I will do it,” and he recited a couple of verses.*";
P_HTM[1474]="***49. “I make weal ripen by woe, I discriminate between seasonable and unseasonable times, hiding at my own will; I unlock the doors of profit; therefore I am content with boiled rice.*";
P_HTM[1475]="***50. When I perceive the time for an effort, maturing my profit by my designs, I will bear myself valiantly like a lion, and by that mighty power you shall see me again.”*";
P_HTM[1476]="***Then the courtier said: “Wise sir, the deity who lives in the parasol has put a question to the king, and the king asked the four wise men, not a wise man of them could solve it! Therefore the king has sent me for you.” “In that case,” said the Great Being, “do you not see the power of wisdom? At such a time prosperity is of no use, but only one who is wise.” Thus he praised wisdom. Then the courtier handed over to the Great Being the thousand pieces of money and the suit of clothes provided by the king, that he might bathe him and dress at once. The potter was terrified to think that Mahosadha the sage had been his workman, but the Great Being consoled him, saying: “Fear not, my master, you have been of great help to me.” Then he gave him a thousand pieces; and with the mud-stains yet upon him mounted in the chariot and went to town.*";
P_HTM[1477]="***The courtier told the king of his arrival. “Where did you find the sage, my son?” “My lord, he was earning his livelihood as a potter in the south town; but as soon as he heard that you had sent for him, without bathing, the mud yet staining his body, he came.” The king thought: “If he were my enemy he would have come with pomp and retinue: he is not my enemy.” Then he gave orders to take him to his house, and bathe him, and adorn him, and to bid him come back with the pomp that should be provided. This was done. He returned, and entered, and gave the king greeting, and stood on one side. The king spoke kindly to him, then to test him spoke this verse:*";
P_HTM[1478]="***51. “Some do no wrong because they are wealthy, but others do no wrong for fear of the taint of blame. You are able, if your mind desired much wealth. Why do you not do me harm?”*";
P_HTM[1479]="***The Bodhisatta said:*";
P_HTM[1480]="***52. “Wise men do not sinful deeds for the sake of the pleasure that wealth gives. Good men, even though struck by misfortune and brought low, neither for friendship nor for enmity will renounce the right.”*";
P_HTM[1481]="***Again the king recited this verse, the mysterious saying of a Khattiya:*";
P_HTM[1482]="***53. “He who for any cause, small or great, should upraise himself from a low place, thereafter would walk in righteousness.”*";
P_HTM[1483]="***And the Great Being recited this verse with an illustration of a tree:*";
P_HTM[1484]="***54. “From off a tree beneath whose shade a man should sit and rest,*";
P_HTM[1485]="***’Twere treachery to lop a branch. False friends we do detest.”*";
P_HTM[1486]="***Then he went on, “Sire, if it is treachery to lop a branch from a tree which one has used, what are we to say of one who kills a man? Your majesty has given my father great wealth, and has shown me great favour: how could I be so treacherous as to injure you?” Thus having demonstrated altogether his loyalty he reproached the king for his fault:*";
P_HTM[1487]="***55. “When any man has disclosed the right to any, or has cleared his doubts, the other becomes his protection and refuge; and a wise man will not destroy this friendship.”*";
P_HTM[1488]="***Now admonishing the king he spoke these two verses:*";
P_HTM[1489]="***56. “The idle sensual layman I detest,*";
P_HTM[1490]="***The false ascetic is a rogue confessed.*";
P_HTM[1491]="***A bad king will a case unheard decide;*";
P_HTM[1492]="***Wrath in the sage can ne’er be justified. 57. The warrior prince takes careful thought, and well-weighed verdict gives,*";
P_HTM[1493]="***When kings their judgment ponder well, their fame for ever lives.”*";
P_HTM[1494]="***The Story about the Deva’s (Four) Questions*";
P_HTM[1495]="***When he had thus said, the king caused the Great Being to sit on the royal throne under the white parasol outspread, and himself sitting on a low seat he said: “Wise sir, the deity who dwells in the white parasol asked me four questions. I consulted the four wise men and they could not find them out: solve me the questions, my son!” “Sire, be it the deity of the parasol, or be they the Four Great Kings, or be they who they may; let who will ask a question and I will answer it.”*";
P_HTM[1496]="***So the king put the question as the Devatā had done, and said:*";
P_HTM[1497]="***58. “He strikes with hands and feet, he beats the face; and he, O king, is dearer than a husband.”*";
P_HTM[1498]="***When the Great Being had heard the question, the meaning became as clear as though the moon had risen in the sky. “Listen, O king!” he said: “When a child on the mother’s lap happy and playful beats his mother with hands and feet, pulls her hair, beats her face with his fist, she says, ‘Little rogue, why do you beat me?’ And in love she presses him close to her breast unable to restrain her affection, and kisses him; and at such a time he is dearer to her than his father.” Thus did he make clear this question, as though he made the sun rise in the sky; and hearing this the Devatā showed half her body from the aperture in the royal parasol, and said in a sweet voice, “The question is well solved!” Then she presented the Great Being with a precious casket full of divine perfumes and flowers, and disappeared.*";
P_HTM[1499]="***The king also presented him with flowers and so forth, and asked him the second question, reciting the second verse:*";
P_HTM[1500]="***59. “She abuses him roundly, yet wishes him to be near: and he, O king, is dearer than a husband.”*";
P_HTM[1501]="***The Great Being said: “Sire, the child of seven years, who can now do his mother’s bidding, when he is told to go to the field or to the bazaar, says, ‘If you will give me this or that sweetmeat I will go;’ she says, ‘Here my son,’ and gives them; then he eats them and says, ‘Yes, you sit in the cool shade of the house and I am to go out on your business!’ He makes a grimace, or mocks her with gestures, and won’t go. She is angry, picks up a stick and cries: ‘You eat what I give you and then won’t do anything for me in the field!’ She scares him, off he runs at full speed; she cannot follow and cries: ‘Get out, may the thieves chop you up into little bits!’ So she abuses him roundly as much as she will; but what her mouth speaks she does not wish at all, and so she wishes him to be near. He plays about the livelong day, and at evening not daring to come home he goes to the house of some kinsman. The mother watches the road for his coming, and sees him not, and thinking that he did not return has her heart full of pain; with tears streaming from her eyes she searches the houses of her kinsfolk, and when she sees her son she hugs and kisses him and squeezes him tight with both arms, and loves him more than ever, as she cries, ‘Did you take my words in earnest?’ Thus, sire, a mother ever loves her son more in the hour of anger.” Thus he explained the second question: the Devatā made him the same offering as before and so did the king.*";
P_HTM[1502]="***Then the king asked him the third question in another verse:*";
P_HTM[1503]="***60. “She reviles him without cause, and without reason reproaches; yet he, O king, is dearer than a husband.”*";
P_HTM[1504]="***The Great Being said: “Sire, when a pair of lovers in secret enjoy their love’s delights, and one says to the other, ‘You don’t care for me, your heart is elsewhere I know!’ All false and without reason, chiding and reproaching each other, then they grow dearer to each other. That is the meaning of the question.” The Devatā made the same offering as before, and so did the king; who then asked him another question, reciting the fourth verse:*";
P_HTM[1505]="***61. “One takes food and drink, clothes and lodging, verily the good men carry them off: yet they, O king, are dearer than a husband.”*";
P_HTM[1506]="***He replied, “Sire, this question has reference to righteous mendicant brahmins. Pious families that believe in this world and the next give to them and delight in giving: when they see such brahmins receiving what is given and eating it, and think, ‘It is to us they came to beg, our own food which they eat’ – they increase affection towards them. Thus verily they take the things, and wearing on the shoulder what has been given, they become dear.” When this question had been answered the Devatā expressed her approval by the same offering as before, and laid before the Great Being’s feet a precious casket full of the seven precious things, praying him to accept it; the king also delighted made him commander in chief. Henceforward great was the glory of the Great Being.*";
P_HTM[1507]="***The Question of the Five Wise Men*";
P_HTM[1508]="***Again these four said: “This common fellow is waxen greater: what are we to do?” Senaka said to them, “All right, I know a plan. Let us go to the fellow and ask him, ‘To whom is it right to tell a secret?’ If he says, ‘To no one,’ we will speak against him to the king and say that he is a traitor.” So the four went to the wise man’s house, and greeted him, and said: “Wise sir, we want to ask you a question.” “Ask away,” said he. Senaka said: “Wise sir, wherein should a man be firmly established?” “In the truth.” “That done, what is the next thing to do?” “He must make wealth.” “What next after that?” “He must learn good counsel.” “After that what next?” “He must tell no man his own secret.” “Thank you, sir,” they said, and went away happy, thinking: “This day we shall see the fellow’s back!” Then they entered the king’s presence and said to him, “Sire, the fellow is a traitor to you!”*";
P_HTM[1509]="***The king replied, “I do not believe you, he will never be traitor to me.” “Believe it, sire, for it is true! But if you do not believe, then ask him to whom a secret ought to be told; if he is no traitor, he will say, ‘To so and so;’ but if he is a traitor he will say, ‘A secret should be told to no one;’ when your desire is fulfilled, then you may speak. Then believe us, and be suspicious no longer.” Accordingly one day when all were seated together he recited the first verse of the Wise Man’s Question from Book XV:*";
P_HTM[1510]="***62. “The five wise men are now together, and a question occurs to me, listen: to whom should a secret be revealed, whether good or bad?”*";
P_HTM[1511]="***This said, Senaka, thinking to bring the king over to their side, repeated this verse:*";
P_HTM[1512]="***63. “Do you declare your mind, O lord of the earth! You are our supporter and bear our burdens. The five clever men will understand your wish and pleasure, and will then speak, O master of men!”*";
P_HTM[1513]="***Then the king in his human infirmity recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1514]="***64. “If a woman be virtuous, and faithful, subservient to her husband’s wish and will, affectionate, a secret should be told whether good or bad to the wife.”*";
P_HTM[1515]="***“Now the king is on my side!” thought Senaka, and pleased he repeated a verse, explaining his own course of conduct:*";
P_HTM[1516]="***65. “He who protects a sick man in distress and who is his refuge and support, may reveal to his friend a secret whether good or bad.”*";
P_HTM[1517]="***Then the king asked Pukkusa, “How does it seem to you, Pukkusa? To whom should a secret be told?” and Pukkusa recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1518]="***66. “Old or young or betwixt, if a brother be virtuous and trusty, to such a brother a secret may be told whether good or bad.”*";
P_HTM[1519]="***Next the king asked Kāvinda, and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1520]="***67. “When a son is obedient to his father’s heart, a true son, of lofty wisdom, to that son a secret may be revealed whether good or bad.”*";
P_HTM[1521]="***And then the king asked Devinda, who recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1522]="***68. “O lord of men! If a mother cherishes her son with loving fondness, to his mother he may reveal a secret whether good or bad.”*";
P_HTM[1523]="***After asking them the king asked, “How do you look upon it, wise sir?” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1524]="***69. “Good is the secrecy of a secret, the revealing of a secret is not to be praised. The clever man should keep it to himself while it is not accomplished; but after it is done he may speak when he will.”*";
P_HTM[1525]="***When the sage had said this the king was displeased: then the king looked at Senaka and Senaka looked at the king. This the Bodhisatta saw, and recognized the fact, that these four had once before slandered him to the king, and that this question must have been put to test him. Now while they were talking the sun had set, and lamps had been lit. “Hard are the ways of kings,” he thought, “what will happen no one can tell; I must depart with speed.” So he rose from his seat, and greeted the king, and went away thinking: “Of these four, one said it should be told to a friend, one to a brother, one to a son, one to a mother: they must have done or seen something; or I think, they have heard others tell what they have seen. Well, well, I shall find out today.” Such was his thought.*";
P_HTM[1526]="***Now on other days, these four on coming out of the palace used to sit on a trough at the palace door, and talk of their plans before going home: so the sage thought that if he should hide beneath that trough he might learn their secrets. Lifting the trough accordingly, he caused a rug to be spread beneath it and crept in, giving directions to his men to fetch him when the four wise men had gone away after their talk. The men promised and departed. Meanwhile Senaka was saying to the king, “Sire, you do not believe us, now what do you think?” The king accepted the word of these tale-tellers without investigation, and asked in terror, “What are we to do now, wise Senaka?” “Sire, without delay, without a word to anyone, he must be killed.” “O Senaka, no one cares for my interests but you. Take your friends with you and wait at the door, and in the morning when the fellow comes to wait upon me, cleave his head with a sword.” So saying he gave them his own precious sword. “Very good, my lord, fear nothing, we will kill him.” They went out saying: “We have seen the back of our enemy!” and sat down on the trough.*";
P_HTM[1527]="***Then Senaka said: “Friends, who shall strike the fellow?” The others said: “You, our teacher,” laying the task on him. Then Senaka said: “You said, friends, that a secret ought to be told to such and such a person: was it something you had done, or seen, or heard?” “Never mind that, teacher: when you said that a secret might be told to a friend, was that something which you had done?” “What does that matter to you?” he asked. “Pray tell us, teacher,” they repeated. He said: “If the king come to know this secret, my life would be forfeit.” “Do not fear, teacher, there’s no one here to betray your secret, tell us, teacher.” Then, tapping upon the trough, Senaka said: “What if that clodhopper is under this!” “O teacher! The fellow in all his glory would not creep into such a place as this! He must be intoxicated with his prosperity. Come, tell us.”*";
P_HTM[1528]="***Senaka told his secret and said: “Do you know such and such a harlot in this city?” “Yes, teacher.” “Is she now to be seen?” “No, teacher.” “In the Sāl-grove I lay with her, and afterwards killed her to get her ornaments, which I tied up in a bundle and took to my house and hung up on an elephant’s tusk in such a room of such a storey: but use them I cannot until it has blown over. This crime I have disclosed to a friend, and he has not told a soul; and that is why I said a secret may be told to a friend.” The sage heard this secret of Senaka’s and bore it in mind.*";
P_HTM[1529]="***Then Pukkusa told his secret. “On my thigh is a spot of leprosy. In the morning my young brother washes it, puts a salve on it and a bandage, and never tells a soul. When the king’s heart is soft he cries, ‘Come here, Pukkusa,’ and he often lays his head on my thigh. But if he knew he would kill me. No one knows this except my young brother; and that is why I said, ‘A secret may be told to a brother.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1530]="***Kāvinda told his secret. “As for me, in the dark fortnight on the Uposatha a Yakkha named Naradeva takes possession of me, and I bark like a mad dog. I told my son about this; and he, when he sees me to be possessed, fastens me up indoors, and then he leaves me shutting the door, and to hide my noises he gathers a party of people. That is why I said that a secret might be told to a son.”*";
P_HTM[1531]="***Then they all three asked Devinda, and he told his secret. “I am inspector of the king’s jewels; and I stole a wonderful lucky gem, the gift of Sakka to king Kusa, and gave it to my mother. When I go to Court she hands it to me, without a word to anyone; and by reason of that gem I am pervaded with the spirit of good fortune when I enter the palace. The king speaks to me first before any of you, and gives me each day to spend eight rupees, or sixteen, or thirty-two, or sixty-four. If the king knew of my having that gem concealed I’m a dead man! That is why I said that a secret might be told to a mother.”*";
P_HTM[1532]="***The Great Being took careful note of all their secrets; but they, after disclosing their secrets as if they had ripped up their bellies and let the entrails out, rose up from the seat and departed, saying: “Be sure to come early and we will kill the churl.”*";
P_HTM[1533]="***When they were gone the sage’s men came and turned up the trough and took the Great Being home. He washed and dressed and ate; and knowing that his sister queen Udumbarī would that day send him a message from the palace, he placed a trusty man on the look-out, bidding him send in at once anyone coming from the palace. Then he lay down on his bed.*";
P_HTM[1534]="***At that time the king also was lying upon his bed and remembering the virtue of the sage. “The sage Mahosadha has served me since he was seven years old, and never done me wrong. When the Devatā asked me her questions but for the sage I had been a dead man. To accept the words of revengeful enemies, to give them a sword and bid them slay a peerless sage, this I ought never to have done. After tomorrow I shall see him no more!” He grieved, sweat poured from his body, possessed with grief his heart had no peace. Queen Udumbarī, who was with him on his couch, seeing him in this frame, asked, “Have I done any offence against you? Or has any other thing caused grief to my lord?” and she repeated this verse:*";
P_HTM[1535]="***70. “Why are you perplexed, O king? We hear not the voice of the lord of men! What do you ponder thus downcast? There is no offence from me, my lord.”*";
P_HTM[1536]="***Then the king repeated a verse:*";
P_HTM[1537]="***71. “They said, the wise Mahosadha must be slain; and condemned by me to death is the most wise one. As I think on this I am downcast. There is no fault in you, my queen.”*";
P_HTM[1538]="***When she heard this, grief crushed her like a rock for the Great Being; and she thought: “I know a plan to console the king: when he goes to sleep I will send a message to my brother.” Then she said to him, “Sire, it is your doing that the churl’s son was raised to great power; you made him commander-in-chief. Now they say he has become your enemy. No enemy is insignificant; killed he must be, so do not grieve.” Thus she consoled the king; his grief waned and he fell asleep. Then up rose the queen and went to her chamber, and wrote a letter to this effect. “Mahosadha, the four wise men have slandered you; the king is angry, and tomorrow has commanded that you be slain in the gate. Do not come to the palace tomorrow morning; or if you do come, come with power to hold the city in your hand.” She put the letter within a sweetmeat, and tied it up with a thread, and put it in a new jar, perfumed it, sealed it up, and gave it to a handmaid, saying: “Take this sweetmeat and give it to my brother.” She did so. You must not wonder how she got out in the night; for the king had previously given this boon to the queen, and therefore no one hindered her. The Bodhisatta received the present and dismissed the woman, who returned and reported that she had delivered it. Then the queen went and lay down by the king. The Bodhisatta opened the sweetmeat, and read the letter, and understood it, and after deliberating what should be done went to rest.*";
P_HTM[1539]="***Early in the morning, the other four wise men sword in hand stood by the gate, but not seeing the sage they became downcast, and went in to the king. “Well,” said he, “is the clodhopper killed?” They replied, “We have not seen him, sire.” And the Great Being at sunrise got the whole city into his power, set guards here and there, and in a chariot with a great host of men and great magnificence came to the palace gates. The king stood looking out of an open window. Then the Great Being got down from his chariot and saluted him; and the king thought: “If he were my enemy, he would not salute me.” Then the king sent for him, and sat upon his throne.*";
P_HTM[1540]="***The Great Being came in and sat on one side: the four wise men also sat down there. Then the king made as if he knew nothing and said: “My son, yesterday you left us and now you come again; why do you treat me thus negligently?” and he repeated this verse:*";
P_HTM[1541]="***72. “At evening you went, now you come. What have you heard? What does your mind fear? Who commanded you, O most wise? Come, we are listening for the word: tell me.”*";
P_HTM[1542]="***The Great Being replied, “Sire, you listened to the four wise men and commanded my death, that is why I did not come,” and reproaching him repeated this verse:*";
P_HTM[1543]="***73. “ ‘The wise Mahosadha must be slain:’ if you told this last night secretly to your wife, your secret was disclosed and I heard it.”*";
P_HTM[1544]="***When the king heard this he looked angrily at his wife thinking that she must have sent word of it on the instant. Observing this the Great Being said: “Why are you angry with the queen, my lord? I know all the past, present, and future. Suppose the queen did tell your secret: who told me the secrets of master Senaka, and Pukkusa, and the rest of them? But I know all their secrets,” and he told Senaka’s secret in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1545]="***74. “The sinful and wicked deed which Senaka did in the Sāl-grove he told to a friend in secret, that secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.”*";
P_HTM[1546]="***Looking at Senaka, the king asked, “Is it true?” “Sire, it is true,” he replied, and the king ordered him to be cast into prison. Then the sage told Pukkusa’s secret in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1547]="***75. “In the man Pukkusa, O king of men, there is a disease unfit for a king’s touching: he told it in secret to his brother. That secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.”*";
P_HTM[1548]="***The king looking upon him asked, “Is it true?” “Yes, my lord,” said he; and the king sent him also to prison. Then the sage told Kāvinda’s secret in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1549]="***76. “Diseased is that man, of evil nature, possessed of Naradeva. He told it in secret to his son: this secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.”*";
P_HTM[1550]="***“Is it true, Kāvinda?” the king asked; and he answered, “It is true.” Then the king sent him also to prison. The sage now told Devinda’s secret in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1551]="***77. “The noble and precious gem of eight facets, which Sakka gave to your grandfather, that is now in Devinda’s hands, and he told it to his mother in secret. That secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.”*";
P_HTM[1552]="***“Is it true, Devinda?” the king asked; and he answered, “It is true.” So he sent him also to prison.*";
P_HTM[1553]="***Thus they who had plotted to slay the Bodhisatta were all in bonds together. And the Bodhisatta said: “This is why I say, a man should tell his secret to no one; those who said that a secret ought to be told, have all come to utter ruin.” And he recited these verses, proclaiming a higher Dhamma:*";
P_HTM[1554]="***78. “The secrecy of a secret is always good, nor is it well to divulge a secret. When a thing is not accomplished the wise man should keep it to himself: when he has accomplished his aim let him speak as he will.*";
P_HTM[1555]="***79. One should not disclose a secret thing, but should guard it like a treasure; for a secret thing is not well revealed by the prudent.*";
P_HTM[1556]="***80. Not to a woman would the wise man tell a secret, not to a foe, nor to one who can be enticed by self-interest, nor for affection’s sake.*";
P_HTM[1557]="***81. He who discloses a secret thing unknown, through fear of broken confidence must endure to be the other’s slave.*";
P_HTM[1558]="***82. As many as are those who know a man’s secret, so many are his anxieties: therefore one should not disclose a secret.*";
P_HTM[1559]="***83. Go apart to tell a secret by day; by night in a soft whisper: for listeners hear the words, therefore the words soon come out.”*";
P_HTM[1560]="***When the king heard the Great Being speak he was angry, and he thought: “These men, traitors themselves to their king, make out that the wise man is traitor to me!” Then he said: “Go drive them out of the town, and impale them or cleave their heads!” So they bound their hands behind them, at every street corner gave them a hundred blows. But as they were dragged along, the sage said: “My lord, these are your ancient ministers, pardon them their fault!” The king consented, and gave them to be his slaves. He set them free at once. Then the king said: “Well, they shall not live in my dominion,” and ordered that they should be banished. But the sage begged him to pardon their blind folly, and appeased him, and persuaded him to restore their positions. The king was much pleased with the sage: if this were his tender mercy towards his foes, what must it be to others! Thenceforward the four wise men, like snakes with their teeth drawn and their poison gone, could not find a word to say, we are told.*";
P_HTM[1561]="***The Battle of the Two Wise Men*";
P_HTM[1562]="***After this time he used to instruct the king in things temporal and spiritual: and he thought: “I am indeed the king’s white parasol; it is I who manage the kingdom: I must therefore be vigilant.” He caused a great rampart to be built for the city. Along the rampart were watchtowers at the gates, and between the watch-towers he dug three moats – a water-moat, a mud-moat, and a dry-moat. Within the city he caused all the old houses to be restored: large banks were dug and he made reservoirs for water; all the storehouses were filled with corn. All the family priests had to bring down from the Himālayas mud and edible lily-seeds. The water conduits were cleaned out, and the old houses outside were also restored. This was done as a defence against future dangers.*";
P_HTM[1563]="***Merchants who came from one place or another were asked whence they came; and on their replying, they were asked what their king liked; when this was told, they were kindly treated before they went away. Then he sent for a hundred and one soldiers and said to them, “My men, take these gifts to the hundred and one royal cities, and give them to their several kings to please them: live there in their service, listen to their actions and plans, and send me word. I will care for your wives and children.” And he sent with them earrings for some, and golden slippers for others, and golden necklets for others, with letters engraved upon them, which he appointed to reveal themselves when it should suit his purpose. The men went this way and that, and gave these gifts to the kings, saying that they were come to live in their service. When asked whence they came, they told the names of other places than that from which they had really come. Their offer accepted, they remained there in attendance, and made themselves to be trusted.*";
P_HTM[1564]="***Now in the kingdom of Ekabala was a king named Saṅkhapāla, who was collecting arms and assembling an army. The man who had come to him sent a message to the sage, saying: “This is the news here, but what he intends I know not; send and find out the truth of the matter.” Then the Great Being called a parrot and said: “Friend, go and find out what king Saṅkhapāla is doing in Ekabala, then travel over all Jambudīpa and bring me the news.” He fed it with honey and grain, and gave it sweet water to drink, anointed the joints of the wings with oil a hundred and a thousand times refined, stood by the eastern window, and let it go. The parrot went to the man aforesaid and found out the truth.*";
P_HTM[1565]="***As he passed back through Jambudīpa he came to Uttarapañcāla city in the kingdom of Kampilla. There was reigning a king named Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, who had for spiritual and temporal adviser a brahmin Kevaṭṭa, wise and learned. The brahmin one morning awoke at dawn, and looking by the light of the lamp upon his magnificent chamber, as he regarded its splendour, thought: “To whom does this splendour belong? To no one but to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta. A king who gives splendour like this ought to be the chief king in all Jambudīpa, and I will be his family priest-in-chief.” And so early in the morning he went to the king, and when he had enquired whether he had slept well, he said: “My lord, there is something I wish to say.” “Say on, teacher.” “My lord, a secret cannot be told in the town, let us go into the park.” “Very well, teacher.”*";
P_HTM[1566]="***The king went to the park with him, and left the retinue without, and set a guard, and entered the park with the brahmin, and sat down upon the royal seat. The parrot, seeing this, thought that there must be something afoot, “Today I shall hear something which must be sent to my wise master.” So he flew into the park, and perched amid the leaves of the royal Sāl tree. The king said: “Speak on, teacher.” He said: “Sire, bend your ear this way; this is a plan for four ears only. If, sire, you will do what I advise, I will make you chief king in all Jambudīpa.” The king heard him greedily, and answered well pleased, “Tell me, my teacher, and I will do it.” “My lord, let us raise an army, and first besiege a small city. Then I will enter the city by a back gate, and will say to the king, ‘Sire, there is no use in your fighting: just be our man; your kingdom you may keep, but if you fight with our mighty force, you will be utterly conquered.’ If he does what I advise, we will receive him; if not, we will fight and kill him, and with two armies go and take another city, and then another, and in this way we shall gain dominion over all Jambudīpa and drink the cup of victory. Then we will bring the hundred and one kings to our city, and make a drinking booth in the park, and seat them there, and provide them with poisoned liquor, and so kill them all and cast them into the Ganges. Thus we will get the hundred and one royal capitals into our hands, and you will become chief king of all Jambudīpa.” “Very well, my teacher,” said he, “I will do so.” “Sire, this plan is for four ears only, no one else must know of it. Make no delay but set forth at once.” The king was pleased with this advice and resolved to do so.*";
P_HTM[1567]="***The parrot which had overheard all their conversation let fall on Kevaṭṭa’s head a lump of dung as though it dropped from a twig. “What’s that?” cried he, looking upwards with mouth gaping wide: whereupon the bird dropped another into his mouth and flew off crying out, “Cree cree! O Kevaṭṭa, you think your plan is for four ears only, but now it is for six; by and by it will be for eight ears and for hundreds of them!” “Catch him, catch him!” they cried; but swift as the wind he flew to Mithilā and entered the wise man’s house.*";
P_HTM[1568]="***Now the parrot’s custom was this: If news from any place was for the sage’s ears alone, he would perch on his shoulder; if queen Amarā was also to hear it, he perched on his lap; if the company might hear it, upon the ground. This time he perched on the shoulder, and at that sign the company retired, knowing it to be secret. The sage took him up to the top storey and asked him, “Well, my dear, what have you seen, what have you heard?” He said: “My lord, in no other king of all Jambudīpa have I seen any danger; but only Kevaṭṭa, family priest to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta in the city of Uttarapañcāla, took his king into the park and told him a plan for their four ears: I was sitting amidst the branches and dropped a ball of dung in his mouth, and here I am!” Then he told the sage all he had seen and heard.*";
P_HTM[1569]="***“Did the king agree to it?” asked he. “Yes, he did,” said the parrot. So the sage tended the bird as was fitting, and put him in his golden cage strewn with soft rugs. He thought to himself, “Kevaṭṭa I think does not know that I am the wise Mahosadha. I will not allow him to accomplish his plan.” Then he removed outside all the poor people who lived in the city, and he brought from all the kingdom, the countryside, and the suburb villages, and settled within the city the rich families of the powerful, and he gathered great quantities of corn.*";
P_HTM[1570]="***And Cullaṇī Brahmadatta did as Kevaṭṭa had proposed: he went with his army and laid siege to a city. Kevaṭṭa, as he had suggested, went into the city and explained matters to the king and won him over. Then joining the two armies Cullaṇī Brahmadatta followed Kevaṭṭa’s advice and went on to another kingdom, until he had brought all the kings of Jambudīpa under his power except king Vedeha. The men provided by the Bodhisatta kept on sending messages to say, “Brahmadatta has taken such and such towns, be on your guard,” to which he replied, “I am on my guard here, be watchful yourselves without remissness.”*";
P_HTM[1571]="***In seven years and seven months and seven days Brahmadatta gained possession of all Jambudīpa, excepting Vedeha. Then he said to Kevaṭṭa, “Teacher, let us seize the empire of Vedeha at Mithilā!” “Sire,” he said, “we shall never be able to get possession of the city where wise Mahosadha lives: he is full of this sort of knowledge, having skill in means.” Then he expatiated on the virtue of the Great Being, as though he drew it on the disk of the moon. Now he himself had skill in means, so he said: “The kingdom of Mithilā is very small, and the dominion of all Jambudīpa is enough for us.” Thus he consoled the king; but the other princes said: “No, we will take the kingdom of Mithilā and drink the cup of victory!” Kevaṭṭa would have stayed them, saying: “What good will it be to take Vedeha’s kingdom? That king is our man already. Come back.” Such was his counsel: they listened to him and turned back. The Great Being’s men sent him word that Brahmadatta with a hundred and one kings on his way to Mithilā turned back and went to his own city. He sent word in answer, that they were to observe what he did.*";
P_HTM[1572]="***Now Brahmadatta deliberated with Kevaṭṭa what was next to do. Hoping to drink the cup of victory, they adorned the park, and told the servants to set out wine in thousands of jars, to prepare fish and flesh of all sorts. This news also the sage’s men sent to him. Now they did not know of the plan to poison the kings, but the Great Being knew it from what the parrot had told him; he sent a message to them accordingly, that they should inform him of the day fixed for this festival, and they did so.*";
P_HTM[1573]="***Then he thought: “It is not right that so many kings should be killed while a wise man like myself lives. I will help them.” He sent for ten thousand warriors, his birth-fellows, and said: “Friends, on such a day Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, they tell me, wishes to adorn his park and to drink wine with the hundred and one kings. Go you there, and before anyone sits on the seats provided for the kings, take possession of the seat of honour next to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, saying, ‘This is for our king’. When they ask whose men you are, tell them king Vedeha’s. They will make a great outcry and say, ‘What! For seven years and seven months and seven days we have been conquering kingdoms, and not once did we see your king Vedeha! What king is he? Go find him a seat at the end!’ You must then squabble and say, ‘Except Brahmadatta, no king is above our king! If we cannot get even a seat for our king we will not let you eat or drink now!’ So shouting and jumping about, terrify them with the noise, break all the pots with your great clubs, scatter the food, and make it unfit to eat, rush amongst the crowd at the top of your speed, and make a din like Asuras invading the city of the gods, calling aloud, ‘We are the wise Mahosadha’s men of Mithilā city: catch us if you can!’ Thus show them that you are there, and then return to me.” They promised to obey, and took their leave; and, armed with the five weapons, set off. They entered the decorated park like Nandana Grove, and beheld all its magnificent array, the seats placed for the hundred and one kings, the white parasols outspread, and all the rest. They did all as directed by the Great Being, and after causing confusion amongst the crowd they returned to Mithilā.*";
P_HTM[1574]="***The king’s men told him what had happened: Brahmadatta was angry, that such a fine plan to poison the princes had failed; while the princes were angry, because they had been deprived of the cup of victory; and the soldiers were angry, because they had lost the chance of free drink. So Brahmadatta said to the princes, “Come, friends, let us go to Mithilā, and cut off king Vedeha’s head with the sword, and trample it underfoot, and then come back and drink the cup of victory! Go tell your armies to get them ready.” Then going apart with Kevaṭṭa, he told him about it, saying: “See, we shall capture the enemy who has threatened this fine plan. With the hundred and one princes and the eighteen complete armies we shall assail that town. Come, my teacher!” But the brahmin was wise enough to know that they could never capture the sage Mahosadha, but all they would get would be disgrace; the king must be dissuaded. So he said: “Sire! This king of Vedeha has no strength; the management is in the hands of the sage Mahosadha, and he is very powerful. Guarded by him, as a lion guards his den, Mithilā can be taken by none. We shall only be disgraced: do not think of going.” But the king, mad with soldier’s pride and the intoxication of empire, cried out, “What will he do!” and departed, with the hundred and one princes and the eighteen complete armies. Kevaṭṭa, unable to persuade him to take his advice, and thinking that it was of no use to thwart him, went with him.*";
P_HTM[1575]="***But those warriors came to Mithilā in one night, and told the sage all that had passed. And the men whom he had before sent into service sent him word, that Cullaṇī Brahmadatta was on his way with the hundred and one kings to take king Vedeha; he must be vigilant. The messages came one after another, “Today he is in such a place, today in such a place, today he will reach the city.” On hearing this the Great Being redoubled his care. And king Vedeha heard it noised about on all sides that Brahmadatta was on his way to take the city.*";
P_HTM[1576]="***Now Brahmadatta in the early evening surrounded the city by the light of a hundred thousand torches. He girdled it with fences of elephants and of chariots and of horses, and at regular intervals placed a mass of soldiers: there stood the men, shouting, snapping their fingers, roaring, dancing, crying aloud. With the light of the torches and the sheen of the armour the whole city of Mithilā in its seven leagues was one blaze of light, the noise of elephants and horses, of chariots, and men made the very earth to crack. The four wise men, hearing the waves of sound and not knowing what it should be, went to the king and said: “Sire, there is a great din, and we know not what it is: will the king enquire?” Hereat the king thought: “No doubt Brahmadatta is come,” and he opened a window, and looked out. When he saw that he was indeed come, the king was dismayed, and said to them, “We are dead men! Tomorrow he will kill us all doubtless!” So they sat talking together. But when the Great Being saw that he had come, fearless as a lion he set guards in all the city, and then went up into the palace to encourage the king. Greeting him, he stood on one side. The king was encouraged to see him, and thought: “There is no one who can save me from this trouble except the wise Mahosadha!” and he addressed him as follows:*";
P_HTM[1577]="***84. “Brahmadatta of Pañcāla has come with all his host; this army of Pañcāla is infinite, O Mahosadha!*";
P_HTM[1578]="***85-86. Men with burdens on their backs, foot-soldiers, men skilful in fight, men ready to destroy, a great din, the noise of drums and conchs, here is all skill in the use of steel weapons, here are banners and knights in mail, accomplished warriors and heroes!*";
P_HTM[1579]="***87. Ten sages are here, profound in wisdom, secret in stratagem, and eleventh, the mother of the king encouraging the host of Pañcāla.*";
P_HTM[1580]="***88. Here are a hundred and one warrior-princes in attendance, their kingdoms reft from them, terror-stricken and overcome by the men of Pañcāla.*";
P_HTM[1581]="***89. What they profess that they do for the king; they are those who speak fair; with Pañcāla they go perforce, being in his power.*";
P_HTM[1582]="***90. Mithilā the royal city is surrounded by this host arrayed with three intervals, digging about it on all sides.*";
P_HTM[1583]="***91. It is surrounded as it were by stars on all sides. Think, Mahosadha! How shall deliverance come?”*";
P_HTM[1584]="***When the Great Being heard this, he thought: “This king is terribly in fear of his life. The sick man’s refuge is the physician, the hungry man’s is food, and drink the thirsty man’s, but I and I alone am his refuge. I will console him.” Then, like a lion roaring upon the plains of Manosilā, he cried, “Fear not, sire, but enjoy your royal power. As I would scare a crow with a clod, or a monkey with a bow, I will scatter that mighty host, and leave them not so much as a waistcloth of their own.” And he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1585]="***92. “Stretch out your feet, eat and be merry: Brahmadatta shall leave the host of Pañcāla and flee away.”*";
P_HTM[1586]="***After encouraging the king, the wise man came out and caused the drums of festival to beat about the city, with a proclamation, “Oyez! Have no fear. Procure garlands, scents, and perfumes, food and drink, and keep seven days’ holiday. Let the people stay where they will, drink deep, sing and dance and make merry, shout and cheer and snap their fingers: all be at my cost. I am the wise Mahosadha: behold my power!” Thus he encouraged the townsfolk. They did so: and those without heard the sound of singing and music. Men came in by the back gate.*";
P_HTM[1587]="***Now it was not their way to arrest strangers at sight, except a foe; so the access was not closed. These men therefore saw the people taken up with merrymaking. And Cullaṇī Brahmadatta heard the noise in the town, and said to his courtiers, “Look you, we have encompassed this city with eighteen great hosts, and the people show neither fear nor anxiety: but full of delight and happiness they snap fingers, they make merry, they leap and sing. What is the meaning of this?”*";
P_HTM[1588]="***Then the men sent previously to foreign service spoke falsely as follows, “My lord, we entered the city by the back gate on some business, and seeing the people all taken up in merrymaking we asked, ‘Why are you so careless when all the kings of Jambudīpa are here besieging your city?’ And they replied, ‘When our king was a boy he had a wish to hold festival when all the kings of Jambudīpa should have besieged the city; and now that wish is fulfilled: therefore he sent round a proclamation, and himself keeps festival in the palace.’ ” This made the king angry; and he sent out a division of his army with these orders, “Disperse all about the city, fill up the trenches, break down the walls, raze the gate-towers, enter the city, use the people’s heads like pumpkins cast on a cart, and bring me here the head of king Vedeha.”*";
P_HTM[1589]="***Then the mighty warriors, armed with all manner of weapons, marched up to the gate, assisted by the sage’s men with red-hot missiles, showers of mud, and stones thrown upon them. When they were in the ditch attempting to destroy the wall, the men in the gate-towers dealt havoc with arrows, javelins, and spears. The sage’s men mocked and jeered at the men of Brahmadatta, with gestures and signs of the hands, and crying, “If you can’t take us, have a bite or a sup, do!” and holding out bowls of toddy and skewers with meat or fish, which they ate and drank themselves, they promenaded atop the walls.*";
P_HTM[1590]="***The others quite unsuccessful returned to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, and said: “My lord, no one but a magician could get in.” The king waited four or five days, not seeing how to take what he wanted to take. Then he asked Kevaṭṭa, “Teacher, take the city we cannot, not a man can get near it! What’s to be done?” “Never mind, your majesty. The city gets water from outside, we will cut off the water and so take it. They will be worn out for want of water, and will open the gates.” “That is the plan,” said the king. After that, they hindered the people from getting near the water.*";
P_HTM[1591]="***The wise man’s spies wrote on a leaf, and fastened it on an arrow, and so sent word to him. Now he had already given orders, that whosoever sees a leaf fastened upon an arrow was to bring it to him. A man saw this, and took it to the sage, who read the message. “He knows not that I am the sage Mahosadha,” he thought. Procuring bamboo poles sixty cubits long, he had them split in two, the knots removed, and then joined again, covered over with leather, and smeared with mud. He then sent for the soil and lily-seed brought from the Himālayas by the ascetics, he planted the seed in the mud by the edge of the tank, and placed the bamboo over it, and filled it with water. In one night it grew up and flowered, rising a fathom above the top of the bamboo. Then he pulled it up and gave it to his men with orders to take it to Brahmadatta.*";
P_HTM[1592]="***They rolled up the stalk, and threw it over the wall, crying out, “Ho servants of Brahmadatta! Don’t starve for want of food. Here you are, wear the flower and fill your bellies with the stalk!” One of the wise man’s spies picked it up, and brought it to the king, and said: “See, your majesty, the stalk of this lily: never was so long a stalk seen before!” “Measure it,” said the king. They measured it and made it out to be eighty fathoms instead of sixty. The king asked, “Where did that grow?” One replied with a made-up tale, “One day, my lord, being thirsty for a little toddy, I went into the city by the back gate, and I saw the great tanks made for the people to play in. There was a number of people in a boat plucking flowers. That was where this grew by the edge of the tank; but those which grew in the deep water would be a hundred cubits high.” Hearing this the king said to Kevaṭṭa, “Teacher, we cannot take them by cutting off the water; make an end of that attempt.” “Well,” said he, “then we will take them by cutting off their food; the city gets its food from outside.” “Very good, teacher.”*";
P_HTM[1593]="***The sage learned this as before, and thought: “He does not know that I am the sage Mahosadha!” Along the rampart he laid mud and there planted rice. Now the wishes of the Bodhisattas always succeed: in one night the rice sprang up and showed over the top of the rampart. This Brahmadatta saw, and asked, “Friend, what is that which shows green above the rampart?” A scout of the sage’s replied, as though catching the words from the king’s lips, “My lord, Mahosadha the farmer’s son, foreseeing danger to come, collected from all the realm grain with which he filled his granaries, throwing out the residue upon the ramparts. No doubt this rice, warmed with the heat and soaked in the rain, grew up there into plants. I myself one day went in by the back gate on some business, and picked up a handful of this rice from a heap on the rampart, and dropped it in the street; whereupon the people laughed at me, and cried, “You’re hungry, it seems! Tie up some of it in the corner of your robe, take it home, and cook it and eat it.” Hearing this, the king said to Kevaṭṭa, “Teacher, by cutting off the grain we shall not take this place; that is not the way.” “Then, my lord, we will take it by cutting off the supply of wood, which the city gets from without.” “So be it, teacher.”*";
P_HTM[1594]="***The Bodhisatta as before got to know of it; and he built a heap of firewood which showed beyond the rice. The people laughed at Brahmadatta’s men, and said: “If you are hungry, here is something to cook your food with,” throwing down great logs of wood as they said it. The king asked, “What is this firewood showing above the rampart?” The scouts said: “The farmer’s son, foreseeing danger to come, collected firewood, and stored it in the sheds behind the houses; what was over he stacked by the rampart side.”*";
P_HTM[1595]="***Then the king said to Kevaṭṭa, “Teacher, we cannot take the place by cutting off the wood; enough of that plan.” “Never mind, sire, I have another plan.” “What is that plan, teacher? I see no end to your plans. Videha we cannot take; let us go back to our city.” My lord, if it is said that Cullaṇī Brahmadatta with a hundred and one princes could not take Videha, we shall be disgraced. Mahosadha is not the only wise man, for I am another: I will use a stratagem.” “What stratagem, teacher?” “We will have a Battle of the Dhamma.” “What do you mean by that?” “Sire, no army shall fight. The two sages of the two kings shall appear in one place, and of these whichever shall salute the other shall be conquered. Mahosadha does not know this idea. I am older and he is younger, and when he sees me he will salute me. Thus we shall conquer Vedeha, and this done we will return home. So we shall not be disgraced. That is what is meant by a Battle of the Dhamma.”*";
P_HTM[1596]="***But the Bodhisatta learned this secret as before. “If I let Kevaṭṭa conquer me thus,” he thought, “I am no sage.” Brahmadatta said: “A capital plan,” and he wrote a letter and sent it to Vedeha by the back gate, to this effect, “Tomorrow there shall be a Battle of the Dhamma between the two sages; and he who shall refuse to fight shall be accounted vanquished.” On receipt of this Vedeha sent for the sage and told him. He answered, “Good, my lord: send word to prepare a place for the Battle of the Dhamma by the western gate, and there to assemble. So he gave a letter to the messenger, and next day they prepared the place for the Battle of the Dhamma to see the defeat of Kevaṭṭa. But the hundred and one princes, not knowing what might befall, surrounded Kevaṭṭa to protect him. These princes went to the place prepared, and stood looking towards the east, and there also was the sage Kevaṭṭa.*";
P_HTM[1597]="***But early in the morning, the Bodhisatta bathed in sweet-scented water, and clothed himself in a Kāsi robe worth a hundred thousand pieces, and adorned himself fully, and after a dainty breakfast went with a great following to the palace-gate. Bidden to enter, he did so, and greeted the king, and sat down on one side. “Well, sage Mahosadha?” said the king. “I am going to the place of the Battle.” “And what am I to do?” “My lord, I wish to conquer Kevaṭṭa with a gem; I must have the eight-sided gem.” “Take it, my son.” He took it, and took his leave, and surrounded by the thousand warriors, his birthmates, he entered the noble chariot drawn by a team of white thoroughbreds, worth ninety thousand pieces of money, and at the time of the midday meal he came to the gate.*";
P_HTM[1598]="***Kevaṭṭa stood watching for his arrival, and saying: “Now he comes, now he comes,” craning his neck till it seemed to be lengthened, and sweating in the heat of the sun. The Great Being, with his retinue, like an inundating sea, like a roused lion, fearless and unruffled, caused the gate to be opened and came forth from the city; descending from his chariot like a lion aroused, he went forward.*";
P_HTM[1599]="***The hundred and one princes beholding his majesty, acclaimed him with thousands of cries, “Here is the sage Mahosadha, son of Sirivaḍḍha, who hath no peer for wisdom in all Jambudīpa!” And he, like Sakka surrounded with his troop of gods, in glory and grandeur unparalleled, holding in his hand the precious gem, stood before Kevaṭṭa. And Kevaṭṭa at first sight of him had not force to stand still, but advanced to meet him, and said: “Sage Mahosadha, we are sages both, and although I have been dwelling near you all this time, you have never yet sent me so much as a gift. Why is this?” The Great Being said: “Wise sir, I was looking for a gift which should be not unworthy of you, and today I have found this gem. Pray take it; there is not its like in the world.” The other seeing the gem ablaze in his hand, thought that he must be desiring to offer it, and said: “Give it me then,” holding out his hand. “Take it,” said the Great Being, and dropped it upon the tips of the fingers of his outstretched hand. But the brahmin could not support the weight of the gem in his fingers, and it slipped down and rolled to the Bodhisatta’s feet; the brahmin in his greed to get it, stooped down to the other’s feet. Then the Great Being would not let him rise, but with one hand held his shoulderblades and with the other his loins, as he cried, “Rise teacher, rise, I am younger than you, young enough to be your grandson; do no obeisance to me.” As he said this again and again, he rubbed his face and forehead against the ground, till it was all bloody, then with the words, “Blind fool, did you think to have an obeisance from me?” he caught him by the throat and threw him away from himself. He fell twenty fathoms away; then got up and ran off.*";
P_HTM[1600]="***Then the Great Being’s men picked up the gem, but the echo of the Bodhisatta’s words, “Rise up, rise, do no obeisance to me!” rose above the din of the crowd. All the people shouted aloud with one voice, “Brahmin Kevaṭṭa did obeisance to the sage’s feet!” And the kings, Brahmadatta and all, saw Kevaṭṭa bow before the feet of the Great Being. “Our sage,” they thought, “has done obeisance to the Great Being; now we are conquered! He will make an end of us all,” and each mounting his horse they began to flee away to Uttarapañcāla. The Bodhisatta’s men seeing them flee, again made a clamour, crying, “Cullaṇī Brahmadatta is in flight with his hundred and one princes!” Hearing this, the princes terrified more and more, ran on and scattered the great host; while the Bodhisatta’s men, shouting and yelling, made a yet louder din.*";
P_HTM[1601]="***The Great Being with his retinue returned to the city; while Brahmadatta’s army ran in rout for three leagues. Kevaṭṭa mounted upon a horse came up with the army wiping off the blood from his forehead, and cried, “Ho there, do not run! I did not bow to the churl! Stop, stop!” But the army would not stop, and made mock of Kevaṭṭa, reviling him, “Bad man! Villain brahmin! You would make a Battle of the Dhamma, and then bow before a stripling young enough to be your grandson! Is not this a thing most unmeet for you!” They would not listen to him, but went on. He dashed on into the army, and cried, “Ho you, you must believe me, I did not bow to him, he tricked me with a gem!” So by one means or another, he convinced the princes and made them believe him, and rallied the broken army.*";
P_HTM[1602]="***Now so great was this host, that if each man of them had taken a clod or a handful of earth and thrown it into the moat, they could have filled the moat and made a heap as high as the rampart. But we know that the intentions of the Bodhisattas are fulfilled; and there was not one who threw a clod or a handful of earth towards the city. They all returned back to their position. Then the king asked Kevaṭṭa, “What are we to do, teacher?” “My lord, let no one come out from the back gate, and cut off all access. The people unable to come out will be discouraged and will open the gate. Thus we shall capture our enemies.”*";
P_HTM[1603]="***The sage was informed as before of the matter, and thought: “If they stay here long we shall have no peace; a way must be found to get rid of them. I will devise a stratagem to make them go.” So he searched for a man clever in such things, and found one named Anukevaṭṭa. To him he said: “Teacher, I have a thing which I want you to carry out.” “What am I to do, wise sir? Tell me.” “Stand on the rampart, and when you see our men incautious, immediately let down cakes, fish, meat, and other food to Brahmadatta’s men, and say, ‘Here, eat this and this, don’t be downhearted; try to stay here a few days longer; before long the people will be like hens in a coop and will open the gate of themselves, and then you will be able to capture Vedeha and that villain of a farmer’s son.’ Our men when they hear this, with harsh upbraiding, will bind you hand and foot in the sight of Brahmadatta’s army, and will pretend to beat you with bamboos, and pull you down, and tying your hair in five knots will daub you with brickdust, put a garland of kaṇavera upon you, belabour you soundly until weals rise on your back, take you up on the rampart, tie you up, and let you down by a rope to Brahmadatta’s men, crying out, ‘Go, traitor!’ Then you will be taken before Brahmadatta, and he will ask your offence; you must say to him, ‘Great king, once I was held in great honour, but the farmer’s son denounced me to my king for a traitor and robbed me of all. I wished to make the man shorter by a head who has ruined me, and in pity for the despondency of your men I gave them food and drink. For that, with the old grudge in his heart, he brought this destruction upon me. Your own men, O king, know all about it.’*";
P_HTM[1604]="***Thus by one means or another you must win the king’s confidence, and then say to him: ‘Sire, now you have me, trouble no more. Now Vedeha and the farmer’s son are dead men! I know the strong places and the weak places of the ramparts in this city. I know where crocodiles are in the moat and where they are not; before long I will bring the city into your hands.’ The king will believe you and do you honour, and will place the army in your charge. Then you must bring down the army into the places infested by snakes and crocodiles; the army in fear of the crocodiles will refuse to go down. You must then say to the king, ‘Your army, my lord, has been corrupted by the farmer’s son; there is not a man of them, not even teacher Kevaṭṭa and the princes, who has not been bribed. They just walk about guarding you, they are all the creatures of the farmer’s son, and I alone am your man. If you do not believe me, order the kings to come before you in full dress; then examine their dresses, their ornaments, their swords, all given them by the farmer’s son and inscribed with his name, and assure yourself.’ He will do so, and make sure, and in fear will dismiss the princes.*";
P_HTM[1605]="***Then he will ask you what is to be done? and you must reply, ‘My lord, the farmer’s son is full of resource, and if you stay here a few days he will gain over all the army and capture yourself. Make no delay, but this very night in the middle watch let us take horse and depart, that we die not in the enemy’s hands.’ He will follow your advice; and while he flees away you must return and tell my people.” Thereupon Anukevaṭṭa replied, “Good, wise sir, I will do your bidding.” “Well then, you must put up with a few blows.” “Wise sir, do what you will with my body, only spare my life and my limbs.”*";
P_HTM[1606]="***Then after showing all respect to Anukevaṭṭa’s family, he caused him to be roughly handled in this manner and handed him over to Brahmadatta’s men. The king tested him, and trusted him, honoured him and gave him charge of the army; he brought the army down to the places which were infested by snakes and crocodiles; and the men terrified by the crocodiles, and wounded by arrows, spears, and lances cast by soldiers who stood upon the battlements, thus perished, after which none were so brave as to approach. Then Anukevaṭṭa approached the king, and said to him, “O great king, there is not a man to fight for you: all have been bribed. If you do not believe me, send for the princes, and see the inscriptions upon their garments and accoutrements.”*";
P_HTM[1607]="***This the king did; and seeing inscriptions upon all their garments and accoutrements, he felt sure that indeed these had taken bribes. “Teacher,” he said, “what’s to be done now?” “My lord, there’s nothing to be done; if you delay, the farmer’s son will capture you. Sire, if the teacher Kevaṭṭa does walk about with a sore on his forehead, yet he also has taken his bribe; he accepted that precious gem, and made you run in rout for three leagues, and then won your confidence again and made you return. He is a traitor! I would not obey him a single night; this very night in the middle watch you should escape. You have not a friend but me.” “Then, teacher, get my horse and chariot ready yourself.”*";
P_HTM[1608]="***Finding that the king was assuredly bent on escape, he encouraged him and bade him fear nothing; then he went out and told the scouts that the king was to escape that night, let them not think of sleep. He next prepared the king’s horse, arranging the reins so that the more he pulled the faster the horse would go; and at midnight he said: “My lord, your horse is ready; see, it is time.” The king mounted the horse and fled. Anukevaṭṭa also got on horseback, as though to go with him, but after going a little way he turned back; and the king’s horse, by the arrangement of its reins, pull as the king would, went on.*";
P_HTM[1609]="***Then Anukevaṭṭa came amongst the army, and shouted with a loud voice, “Cullaṇī Brahmadatta has fled!” The scouts and their attendants cried out too. The other princes, hearing the noise, thought in their terror, “Sage Mahosadha must have opened the gate and come out; we shall all be dead men!” Giving but a look at all the materials of their use and enjoyment, away they ran. The men shouted the louder, “The princes are in rout!” Hearing the noise, all the others who stood at the gate and on the towers shouted and clapped their hands. Then the whole city within and without was one great roar, as though the earth cleft asunder, or the great deep were broken up, while the innumerable myriads of that mighty host in mortal terror, without refuge or defence, cried aloud, “Brahmadatta is taken by Mahosadha with the hundred and one kings!” Away they ran in rout, throwing down even their waistclothes. The camp was empty. Cullaṇī-Brahmadatta entered his own city with the hundred and one chiefs.*";
P_HTM[1610]="***Next morning, the soldiers opened the city gates and went forth, and seeing the great booty, reported it to the Great Being, asking what they were to do. He said: “The goods which they have left are ours. Give to our king that which belonged to the princes, and bring to me that which belonged to Kevaṭṭa and the other private persons; all the rest let the citizens take.” It took half a month to remove the jewels of price and valuable goods, four months for the rest. The Great Being gave great honour to Anukevaṭṭa. From that day the citizens of Mithilā had plenty of gold.*";
P_HTM[1611]="***Now Brahmadatta and those kings had been a year in the city of Uttarapañcāla; when one day, Kevaṭṭa, looking upon his face in a mirror, saw the scar on his forehead and thought: “That is the doing of the farmer’s son: he made me a laughingstock before all those kings!” Anger arose in him. “How can I manage to see his back?” he thought. “Ah, here is a plan. Our king’s daughter, Pañcālacaṇḍī is peerless in beauty, like a divine nymph; I will show her to king Vedeha. He will be caught by desire like a fish that has swallowed the hook: I will land him and Mahosadha with him, and kill them both, and drink the cup of victory!” With this resolve, he approached the king. “My lord,” said he, “I have an idea.” “Yes, teacher, your idea left me once without a rag to cover me. What will you do now? Hold your peace.” “Sire, there never was a plan equal to this.” “Speak on, then.” “Sire, we two must be alone.” “So be it.” The brahmin took him into an upper storey, and said: “Great king! I will attract king Vedeha by desire, to bring him here, and kill him.” “A good plan, teacher, but how are we to arouse his desire?” “Sire, your daughter Pañcālacaṇḍī is peerless in beauty; we will have her charms and accomplishments celebrated in verse by poets, and have those poems sung in Mithilā. When we find that he is saying to himself, ‘If the mighty monarch Vedeha cannot get this pearl of maidens, what is his kingdom to him?’ and that he is caught in the attraction of the idea, I will go and fix a day; on the day fixed by me he will come, like a fish that has swallowed the hook, and the farmer’s son with him; then we will kill them.” This pleased the king, and he agreed, “A fine plan that, my teacher! So we will do.”*";
P_HTM[1612]="***But a mynah bird, that watched the king’s bed, took note of it.*";
P_HTM[1613]="***And so the king sent for clever poets, and paid them richly, and showed them his daughter, bidding them make a poem on her beauty; and they made songs of exceeding great sweetness, and recited them to the king. He rewarded them richly. Musicians learned these songs from the poets, and sang them in public, and thus they were spread abroad. When they had been spread abroad, the king sent for the singers, and said: “My children, climb into the trees by night with some birds, sit there and sing, and, in the morning, tie bells about their necks, let them fly, and come down.” This he did that the world might say, the very gods sing the beauty of the king of Pañcāla’s daughter. Again the king sent for these poets, and said to them, “My children, make poems to this effect, that such a princess is not for any king in all Jambudīpa save Vedeha king of Mithilā, praising the king’s majesty and the girl’s beauty.” They did so, and reported it; the king paid them well, and told them to go to Mithilā and sing in the same way.*";
P_HTM[1614]="***They went to Mithilā, singing these songs on the way, and there sang them in public. Crowds of people heard the songs, and amidst loud applause paid them well. At night they would climb into the trees and sing, and, in the morning, tied bells about the birds’ necks before they came down. People heard the sound of the bells in the air, and all the city rang with the news, that the very gods were singing the beauty of the king’s daughter. The king hearing of it sent for the poets, and made an audience in his palace. He was to think that they wanted to give him the peerless daughter of king Cullaṇī. So he paid them well, and they came back and told Brahmadatta. Then Kevaṭṭa said to him, “Now, sire, ’tis time for me to go and settle the day.” “Very good, teacher, what must you take with you?” “A little present.” He gave it.*";
P_HTM[1615]="***The other went with it, accompanied by a large following, to Vedeha’s kingdom. On his arrival being made known, all the city was in an uproar, “King Cullaṇī and Vedeha, they say, will strike a friendship; Cullaṇī will give his daughter to our king, and Kevaṭṭa, they say, is coming to fix a day.” King Vedeha also heard this; and the Great Being heard it, and thought: “I like not his coming; I must find out about it exactly.” So he sent word to spies that lived with Cullaṇī. They replied, “We do not quite understand this business. The king and Kevaṭṭa were sitting and talking in the royal bedchamber; but the mynah which watches the bedchamber will know about it.”*";
P_HTM[1616]="***On hearing this, the Great Being thought: “That our enemies may not have an advantage, I will parcel out the whole city and decorate it, and not allow Kevaṭṭa to see it.” So from the city gate to the palace, and from the palace to his own house, on both sides of the road he erected lattice-work, and covered all over with mats, covered all with pictures, scattered flowers upon the ground, set jars full of water in place, hung flags and banners. Kevaṭṭa as he entered the city could not see its arrangements; he thought the king had decorated it for his sake, and did not understand that it had been done that he might not see. When he came before the king, he offered his gift, and with a courteous greeting sat down on one side. Then after an honourable reception, he recited two verses, to announce the reason of his arrival:*";
P_HTM[1617]="***93. “A king who wishes for your friendship sends you these precious things: now let worthy sweet-spoken ambassadors come from that place.*";
P_HTM[1618]="***94. Let them utter gentle words which shall give pleasure, and let the people of Pañcāla and Videha be as one.”*";
P_HTM[1619]="***“Sire,” he went on, “he would have sent another in place of me, but me he sent, feeling sure that no other could tell the tale so pleasantly as I should do. ‘Go, teacher,’ said he, ‘win over the king to look favourably upon it, and bring him back with you.’ Now, sire, go, and you shall receive an excellent and beautiful princess, and there shall be friendship established between our king and you.” The king was pleased at this proposal; he was attracted by the idea that he should receive a princess of peerless beauty, and replied, “Teacher, there was a quarrel between you and the wise Mahosadha at the Battle of the Dhamma. Now go and see my son; you two wise men must make up your differences; and after a talk together, come back.” Kevaṭṭa promised to go and see the sage, and he went.*";
P_HTM[1620]="***Now the Great Being that day, determined to avoid talking with this bad man, in the morning drank a little ghee; they smeared the floor with wet cow-dung, and smeared the pillars with oil; all chairs and seats they removed except one narrow couch on which he lay. To his servants he gave orders as follows, “When the brahmin begins to talk, say, ‘Brahmin, do not talk with the sage; he has taken a dose of ghee today’. And when I make as though to talk with him, stop me, saying, ‘My lord, you have taken a dose of ghee – do not talk.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1621]="***After these instructions the Great Being covered himself with a red robe, and lay down on his couch, after posting men at the seven gate-towers. Kevaṭṭa, reaching the first gate, asked where the wise man was? Then the servants answered, “Brahmin, do not make much noise; if you wish to go in, go silently. Today the sage has taken ghee, and he cannot stand a noise.” At the other gates they told him the same thing. When he came to the seventh gate, he entered the presence of the sage, and the sage made as though to speak: but they said: “My lord, do not talk; you have taken a strong dose of ghee – why should you talk with this wretched brahmin?” So they stayed him. The other came in, but could not find where to sit, nor a place to stand by the bed. He passed over the wet cow-dung and stood. Then one looked at him and rubbed his eyes, one lifted his eyebrow, one scratched his elbow. When he saw this, he was annoyed, and said: “Wise sir, I am going.” Another said: “Ha, wretched brahmin, don’t make a noise! If you do, I’ll break your bones for you!” Terrified he looked back, when another struck him on the back with a bamboo stick, another caught him by the throat and pushed him, another slapped him on the back, until he departed in fear, like a fawn from the panther’s mouth, and returned to the palace.*";
P_HTM[1622]="***Now the king thought: “Today my son will be pleased to hear the news. What a talking there will be between the two wise men about the Dhamma! Today they will be reconciled together, and I shall be the gainer.” So when he saw Kevaṭṭa, he recited a verse, asking about their conversation together:*";
P_HTM[1623]="***95. “How did your meeting with Mahosadha come off, Kevaṭṭa? Pray tell me that. Was Mahosadha reconciled, was he pleased?”*";
P_HTM[1624]="***To this Kevaṭṭa replied, “Sire, you think that is a wise man, but there is not another man less good,” and he recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1625]="***96. “He is a man ignoble of nature, lord of men! Disagreeable, obstinate, wicked in disposition, like one dumb or deaf: he said not a word.”*";
P_HTM[1626]="***This displeased the king, but he found no fault. He provided Kevaṭṭa and his attendants with all that they needed and a house to live in, and bade him go and rest. After he had sent him away the king thought to himself, “My son is wise, and knows well how to be courteous; yet he would not speak courteously to this man and did not want to see him. Surely he must have seen cause for some apprehension in the future!” Then he composed a verse of his own:*";
P_HTM[1627]="***97. “Verily this resolution is very hard to understand; a clear issue has been foreseen by this strong man. Therefore my body is shaken: who shall lose his own and fall into the hands of his foe?*";
P_HTM[1628]="***No doubt my son saw some mischief in the brahmin’s visit. He will have come here for no friendly purpose. He must have wished to attract me by desire, and make me go to his city, and there capture me. The sage must have foreseen some danger to come.” As he was turning over these thoughts in his mind, with alarm, the four wise men came in. The king said to Senaka, “Well, Senaka, do you think I ought to go to the city of Uttarapañcāla and marry king Cullaṇī’s daughter?” He replied, “O sire, what is this you say! When luck comes your way, who would drive it off with blows? If you go there and marry her, you will have no equal save Cullaṇī Brahmadatta in all Jambudīpa, because you will have married the daughter of the chief king. The king knows that the other princes are his men, and Vedeha alone is his peer, and so desires to give you his peerless daughter. Do as he says and we also shall receive dresses and ornaments.” When the king asked the others, they all said the same. And as they were thus conversing, brahmin Kevaṭṭa came from his lodging to take his leave of the king, and go; and he said: “Sire, I cannot linger here, I would go, prince of men!” The king showed him respect, and let him go.*";
P_HTM[1629]="***When the Great Being heard of his departure, he bathed and dressed and went to wait on the king, and saluting him sat on one side. Thought the king, “Wise Mahosadha my son is great and full of resource, he knows past, present and future; he will know whether I ought to go or not,” yet befooled by passion he did not keep to his first resolve, but asked his question in a verse:*";
P_HTM[1630]="***98. “All six have one opinion, and they are sages supreme in wisdom. To go or not to go, to abide here – Mahosadha, tell me your opinion also.”*";
P_HTM[1631]="***At this the sage thought: “This king is exceedingly greedy in desire: blind and foolish he listens to the words of these four. I will tell him the mischief of going and dissuade him.” So he repeated four verses:*";
P_HTM[1632]="***99. “Do you know, great king: mighty and strong is king Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, and he wants you to kill, as a hunter catches the deer by decoy.*";
P_HTM[1633]="***100-101. As a fish greedy for food does not recognize the hook hidden in the bait, or a mortal his death, so you O king, greedy in desire, do not recognize Cullaṇī’s daughter, you, mortal, your own death.*";
P_HTM[1634]="***102. Go to Pañcāla, and in a little time you will destroy yourself, as a deer caught on the road comes into great danger.”*";
P_HTM[1635]="***At this heavy rebuke, the king was angry. “The man thinks I am his slave,” he thought, “he forgets I am a king. He knows that the chief king has sent to offer me his daughter, and says not a word of good wishes, but foretells that I shall be caught and killed like a silly deer or a fish that swallows the hook or a deer caught on the road!” and immediately he recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1636]="***103. “I was foolish, I was deaf and dumb, to consult you on high matters. How can you understand things like other men, when you grew up hanging on to the plow-tail?”*";
P_HTM[1637]="***With these opprobrious words, he said: “This clodhopper is hindering my good luck! Away with him!” and to get rid of him he uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[1638]="***104. “Take this fellow by the neck and rid my kingdom of him, who speaks to hinder my getting a jewel.”*";
P_HTM[1639]="***But he, seeing the king’s anger, thought: “If any one at the bidding of this king seize me by hand or by neck, or touch me, I shall be disgraced to my dying day; therefore I will go of myself.” So he saluted the king and went to his house. Now the king had merely spoken in anger: but out of respect for the Bodhisatta he did not command any one to carry out his words. Then the Great Being thought: “This king is a fool, he knows not his own profit or unprofit. He is in love; and determined to get that princess, he does not perceive the danger to come; he will go to his ruin. I ought not to let his words lie in my mind. He is my great benefactor, and has done me much honour. I must have confidence in him. But first I will send the parrot and find out the facts, then I will go myself.” So he sent the parrot.*";
P_HTM[1640]="***To explain this the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[1641]="***105. “Then he went out of Vedeha’s presence, and spake to his messenger, Māṭhara, the clever parrot:*";
P_HTM[1642]="***106-107. Come, my green parrot, do a service for me. The king of Pañcāla has a mynah that watches his bed: ask him in full, for he knows all, knows all the secrets of the king and Kosiya.*";
P_HTM[1643]="***108. Māṭhara the clever parrot listened, and went – the green parrot – to the mynah bird.*";
P_HTM[1644]="***109. Then this clever parrot Māṭhara spake to the sweet-voiced mynah in her fine cage:*";
P_HTM[1645]="***110. ‘Is all well with you in your fine cage? Is all happy, O Vessā? Do they give you parched honey-corn in your fine cage?’*";
P_HTM[1646]="***111. ‘All is well with me, sir, indeed, all is happy, they do give me parched honey-corn, O clever parrot.*";
P_HTM[1647]="***112. Why have you come, sir, and why were you sent? I never saw you or heard of you before.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1648]="***On hearing this, he thought: “If I say, I am come from Mithilā, for her life she will never trust me. On my way I noticed the town Ariṭṭhapura in this kingdom of Sivi; so I will make up a false tale, how the king of Sivi has sent me here,” and he said:*";
P_HTM[1649]="***113. “I was king Sivi’s chamberlain in his palace, and from thence that righteous king set the prisoners free from bondage.”*";
P_HTM[1650]="***Then the mynah gave him the honey-corn and honey-water which stood ready for her in a golden dish, and said: “Sir, you have come a long way: what has brought you?” He made up a tale, desirous to learn the secret, and said,*";
P_HTM[1651]="***114. “I once had to wife a sweet-voiced mynah, and a hawk killed her before my eyes.”*";
P_HTM[1652]="***Then she asked, “But how did the hawk kill your wife?” He told her this story. “Listen, madam. One day our king invited me to join him at a water-party. My wife and I went with him, and amused ourselves. In the evening we returned with him to the palace. To dry our feathers, my wife and I flew out of a window and sat on the top of a pinnacle. At that moment a hawk swooped down to catch us as we were leaving the pinnacle. In fear of my life I flew swiftly off; but she was heavy then, and could not fly fast; hence before my eyes he killed her and carried her off. The king saw me weeping for her loss, and asked me the reason. On hearing what had occurred, he said: “Enough, friend, do not weep, but look for another wife.” I replied, “What need I, my lord, to wed another, wicked and vicious? Better to live alone.” He said: “Friend, I know a bird virtuous like your wife; king Cullaṇī’s chamberlain is a mynah like her. Go and ask her will, and let her reply, and if she likes you come and tell me; then I or my queen will go with great pomp and bring her back.” With these words he sent me, and that is why I am come.” And he said:*";
P_HTM[1653]="***115. “Full of love for her I am come to you: if you give me leave we might dwell together.”*";
P_HTM[1654]="***These words pleased her exceedingly; but without showing her feelings she said, as though unwilling:*";
P_HTM[1655]="***116. “Parrot should love parrot, and mynah love mynah: how can there be union between parrot and mynah?”*";
P_HTM[1656]="***The other hearing this thought: “She does not reject me; she is only making much of herself. Indeed she loves me doubtless. I will find some parables to make her trust me.” So he said:*";
P_HTM[1657]="***117. “Whomsoever the lover loves, be it a low Caṇḍālī, all are alike: in love there is no unlikeness.”*";
P_HTM[1658]="***This said, he went on, to show the measure of the differences in the birth of men,*";
P_HTM[1659]="***118. “The mother of the king of Sivi is named Jambāvatī, and she was the beloved queen consort of Vāsudeva the Kaṇha.”*";
P_HTM[1660]="***Now the king of Sivi’s mother, Jambāvatī, was an outcaste, and she was the beloved queen consort of Vāsudeva, one of the Kaṇhāgaṇa clan, the eldest of ten brothers. The story goes, that he one day went out from Dvāravatī into the park; and on his way he espied a very beautiful girl, standing by the way, as she journeyed on some business from her outcaste village to town. He fell in love, and asked her birth; and on hearing that she was a Caṇḍālī, he was distressed. Finding that she was unmarried, he turned back at once, and took her home, surrounded her with precious things, and made her his chief queen. She brought forth a son Sivi, who ruled in Dvāravatī at his father’s death.*";
P_HTM[1661]="***After giving this example, he went on, “Thus even a prince such as he mated with an outcaste; and what of us, who are but of the animal kingdom? If we like to mate together, there is no more to be said.” And he gave another example as follows:*";
P_HTM[1662]="***119. “Rathavatī, a Kimpurisī, also loved Vaccha, and the man loved the animal. In love there is no unlikeness.”*";
P_HTM[1663]="***Vaccha was an ascetic of that name, and the way she loved him was this. In times gone by, a brahmin, who had seen the evil of the passions, left great wealth to follow the ascetic life, and lived in the Himālayas in a hut of leaves which he made him. Not far from this hut in a cave lived a number of Kinnaras, and in the same place lived a spider. This spider used to spin his web, and crack the heads of these creatures, and drink their blood. Now the Kinnaras were weak and timid, the spider was mighty and very poisonous: they could do nothing against him, so they came to the ascetic, and saluted him, and told him how a spider was destroying them and they could see no help; wherefore they begged him to kill the spider and save them. But the ascetic drove them away, crying, “Men like me take no life!” A female of these creatures, named Rathavatī, was unmarried; and they brought her in all her finery to the ascetic, and said: “Let her be your handmaiden, and do you slay our enemy.” When the ascetic saw her he fell in love, and kept her with him, and lay in wait for the spider at the cave’s mouth, and as he came out for food killed him with a club. So he lived with the Kinnarī and begat sons and daughters on her, and then died. Thus she loved him.”*";
P_HTM[1664]="***The parrot, having described this example, said: “Vaccha the ascetic, although a man, lived with a Kinnarī, who belonged to the animal world; why should not we do the same, who both are birds?”*";
P_HTM[1665]="***When she heard him she said: “My lord, the heart is not always the same: I fear separation from my beloved.” But he, being wise and versed in the wiles of women, further tested her with this verse:*";
P_HTM[1666]="***120. “Verily I shall go away, O sweet-voiced mynah. This is a refusal; no doubt you despise me.”*";
P_HTM[1667]="***Hearing this she felt as though her heart would break; but before him she made as though she was burning with newly awakened love, and recited a verse and a half:*";
P_HTM[1668]="***121. “No luck for the hasty, O wise parrot Māṭhara. Stay here until you shall see the king, and hear the sound of tabours and see the splendour of our king.”*";
P_HTM[1669]="***So when evening came they took their pleasure together; and they lived in friendship and pleasure and delight. Then the parrot thought, ‘Now she will not hide the secret from me; now I must ask it of her and go.’ “Mynah,” said he. “What is it, my lord?” “I want to ask you something; shall I say it?” “Say on, my lord.” “Never mind, today is a festival; another day I will see about it.” “If it be suitable to a festival, say it, if not, my lord, say nothing.” “Indeed, this is a thing fit for a festival day.” “Then speak.” “If you will listen, I will speak.” Then he asked the secret in a verse and a half:*";
P_HTM[1670]="***122. “This sound so loud heard over the countryside – the daughter of the king of Pañcāla, bright as a star – he will give her to the Videhas, and this will be their wedding!”*";
P_HTM[1671]="***When she heard this she said: “My lord! On a day of festival you have said a thing most unlucky!” “I say it is lucky, you say it is unlucky: what can this mean?” “I cannot tell you, my lord.” “Madam, from the time when you refuse to tell me a secret which you know, our happy union ends.” Importuned by him she replied, “Then, my lord, listen:*";
P_HTM[1672]="***123. Let not even your enemies have such a wedding, Māṭhara, as there shall be betwixt the kings of Pañcāla and Videha.”*";
P_HTM[1673]="***Then he asked, “Why do you ask such a thing, madam?” She replied, “Listen now, and I will tell you the mischief of it,” and she repeated another verse:*";
P_HTM[1674]="***124. “The mighty king of Pañcāla will attract Videha, and then he will kill him; his friend he will not be.”*";
P_HTM[1675]="***So she told the whole secret to the wise parrot; and the wise parrot, hearing it, extolled Kevaṭṭa, “This teacher has skill in means; ’tis a wonderful plan to kill the king. But what is so unlucky a thing to us? Silence is best.” Thus he attained the fruit of his journey. And after passing the night with her, he said: “Lady, I would go to the Sivi country, and tell the king how I have got a loving wife,” and he took leave in the following words:*";
P_HTM[1676]="***125. “Now give me leave for just seven nights, that I may tell the mighty king of Sivi, how I have found a dwelling-place with a mynah.”*";
P_HTM[1677]="***The mynah hereat, although unwilling to part with him, yet unable to refuse, recited the next verse:*";
P_HTM[1678]="***126. “Now I give you leave for seven nights; if after seven nights you do not return to me, I see myself gone down into the grave; I shall be dead when you return.”*";
P_HTM[1679]="***The other said: “Lady, what is this you say! If I see you not after seven days, how can I live?” So he spake with his lips, but thought in his heart, “Live or die, what care I for you?” He rose up, and after flying for a short distance towards the Sivi country, he turned off and went to Mithilā. Then descending upon the wise man’s shoulder, when the Great Being had taken him to the upper storey, and asked his news, he told him all. The other did him all honour as before.*";
P_HTM[1680]="***This the Teacher explained as follows:*";
P_HTM[1681]="***127. “And then Māṭhara, the wise parrot, said to Mahosadha: ‘This is the story of the mynah.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1682]="***The Tunnel*";
P_HTM[1683]="***On hearing it the Great Being thought: “The king will go, whether I want or not, and if he goes, he will be utterly destroyed. And if by bearing a grudge against such a king who gave me such wealth, I refrain from doing well to him, I shall be disgraced. When there is found one so wise as I, why should he perish? I will set out before the king, and see Cullaṇī; and I will arrange all well, and I will build a city for king Vedeha to dwell in, and a smaller passage a mile long, and a great tunnel of half a league; and I will consecrate king Cullaṇī’s daughter and make her our king’s handmaiden; and even when our city is surrounded by the hundred and one kings with their army of eighteen myriads, I will save our king, as the moon is saved from the jaws of Rāhu, and bring him home. His return is in my hands.” As he thought thus, joy pervaded his body, and by force of this joy he uttered this exalted utterance:*";
P_HTM[1684]="***128. “A man should always work for his interest in whose house he is fed.”*";
P_HTM[1685]="***Thus bathed and anointed he went in great pomp to the palace, and saluting the king, stood on one side. “My lord,” he asked, “are you going to the city of Uttarapañcāla?” “Yes, my son; if I cannot gain Pañcālacaṇḍī, what is my kingdom to me? Leave me not, but come with me. By going there, two benefits will be mine: I shall gain the most precious of women, and make friendship with the king.” Then the wise man said: “Well, my lord, I will go on ahead, and build dwellings for you; do you come when I send word.” Saying this, he repeated two verses:*";
P_HTM[1686]="***129. “Truly I will go first, lord of men, to the lovely city of Pañcāla’s king, to build dwellings for the glorious Vedeha.*";
P_HTM[1687]="***130. When I have built dwellings for the glorious Vedeha, come, mighty warrior, when I send word.”*";
P_HTM[1688]="***The king on hearing this was pleased that he should not desert him, and said: “My son, if you go on ahead, what do you want?” “An army, sire.” “Take as many as you wish, my son.” The other went on, “My lord, have the four prisons opened, and break the chains that bind the robbers therein, and send these also with me.” “Do as you will, my son,” he replied.*";
P_HTM[1689]="***The Great Being caused the prisons to be opened, and brought forth mighty heroes who were able to do their duty wherever they should be sent, and bade them serve him; he showed great favour to these, and took with him eighteen companies of men, masons, blacksmiths, carpenters, painters, men skilled in all arts and crafts, with their razor-adzes, spades, hoes, and many other tools. So with a great company he went out of the city.*";
P_HTM[1690]="***The Teacher explained it by this verse:*";
P_HTM[1691]="***131. “The Mahosadha went on ahead, to the goodly town of the king of Pañcāla, to build dwellings for Vedeha the glorious.”*";
P_HTM[1692]="***On his way, the Great Being built a village at every league’s end, and left a courtier in charge of each village, with these directions, “Against the king’s return with Pañcālacaṇḍī you are to prepare elephants, horses, and chariots, to keep off his enemies, and to convey him speedily to Mithilā.” Arrived at the Ganges’ bank, he called Ānandakumāra, and said to him, “Ānanda, take three hundred wrights, go to the Upper Ganges, procure choice timber, build three hundred ships, make them cut stores of wood for the town, fill the ships with light wood, and come back soon.”*";
P_HTM[1693]="***Himself in a ship he crossed over the Ganges, and from his landing-place he paced out the distances, thinking: “This is half a league, here shall be the great tunnel: in this place shall be the town for our king to dwell in; from this place to the palace, a mile long, shall be the small passage.” So he marked out the place; and then entered the city.*";
P_HTM[1694]="***When king Cullaṇī heard of the Bodhisatta’s coming, he was exceedingly well pleased; for he thought: “Now the desire of my heart shall be fulfilled; now that he is come, Vedeha will not be long in coming: then will I kill them both and make one kingdom of all Jambudīpa.” All the city was in a ferment, “This, they say, is the wise Mahosadha, who put to flight the hundred and one kings as a crow is scared by a clod!”*";
P_HTM[1695]="***The Great Being proceeded to the palace gates while the citizens gazed at his beauty; then dismounting from the carriage, he sent word to the king. “Let him come,” the king said; and he entered, and greeted the king, and sat down on one side. Then the king spoke politely to him, and asked, “My son, when will the king come?” “When I send for him, my lord.” “But why are you come, then?” “To build for our king a place to dwell in, my lord.” “Good, my son.” He gave an allowance for the escort, and showed great honour to the Great Being, and allotted him a house, and said: “My son, until your king shall come, live here, and do not be idle, but do what should be done.”*";
P_HTM[1696]="***But as he entered the palace, he stood at the foot of the stairs, thinking: “Here must be the door of the little tunnel,” and again this came into his mind, “The king told me to do for him anything that had to be done; I must take care that this stairway does not fall in while we are digging the tunnel.” So he said to the king, “My lord, as I entered, standing by the stair-foot, and looking at the new work, I saw a fault in the great staircase. If it please you, give me word and I will make it all right.” “Good, my son, do so.”*";
P_HTM[1697]="***He examined the place carefully, and determined where the exit of the tunnel should be; then he removed the stair, and to keep the earth from falling into this place, he arranged a platform of wood, and thus fixed the stair firmly so that it should not collapse. The king all unwitting thought this to be done from goodwill to himself. The other spent that day in superintending the repairs, and on the next day he said to the king, “My lord, if I could know where our king is to dwell, I could make it all right and take care of it.” “Very good, wise sir: choose a place for his dwelling where you will in the city, except my palace.” “Sire, we are strangers, you have many favourites: if we take their houses, your soldiers will quarrel with us. What are we to do?” “Wise sir, do not listen to them, but choose the place which may please you.” “My lord, they will come to you over and over again with complaints, and that will not be pleasant for you; but if you will, let our men be on guard until we take possession of the houses, and they will not be able to get past the door, but will go away. Thus both you and we shall be content.” The king agreed.*";
P_HTM[1698]="***The Great Being placed his own guards at the foot and head of the stairway, at the great gate, everywhere, giving orders that no one was to pass by. Then he ordered his men to go to the queen-mother’s house, and to make as though they would pull it down. When they began to pull down bricks and mud from the gates and walls, the queen-mother heard the news and asked, “You fellows, why do you break down my house?” “Mahosadha the sage wishes to pull it down and to build a palace for his king.” “If that be so, you may live in this place.” “Our king’s retinue is very large; this place will not do, and we will make a large house for him.” “You do not know me: I am the queen-mother, and now I will go to my son and see about it.” “We are acting by the king’s orders; stop us if you can!” She grew angry, and said: “Now I will see what is to be done with you,” and proceeded to the palace gate; but they would not let her go in. “Fellows, I am the king’s mother!” “Oh, we know you; but the king has ordered us to let no one come in. Go away!” She was unable to get into the palace, and stood looking at her house. Then one of the men said, “What are you doing here? Away with you!” He seized her by the throat and threw her upon the ground.*";
P_HTM[1699]="***She thought: “Verily it must be the king’s command, otherwise they would not be able to do this: I will visit the sage.” She asked him, “Son Mahosadha, why do you pull down my house?” but he would not speak to her. But a bystander said: “What did you say, madam?” “My son, why does the sage pull down my house?” “To build a dwelling for king Vedeha.” “Why, my son! In all this great city can he find no other place to live in? Take this bribe, a hundred thousand pieces of money, and let him build elsewhere.” “Very good, madam, we will leave your house alone; but do not tell any one that you have given this bribe, that no others may wish to bribe us to spare their houses.” “My son! If it were said that the queen-mother had need to bribe, the shame would be mine! I shall tell no one.” The man consented, and took the hundred thousand pieces, and left that house. Then he went to Kevaṭṭa’s house; who went to the palace gate, and had the skin of his back torn by bamboo sticks, but being unable to get an entrance, he also gave a hundred thousand pieces. In this way, by seizing houses in all parts of the city, and procuring bribes, they got nine crores of gold pieces.*";
P_HTM[1700]="***After this the Great Being traversed the whole city, and returned to the palace. The king asked him whether he had found a place. “Sire,” he said, “they are all willing to give; but as soon as we take possession they are stricken with grief. We do not wish to be the cause of unpleasantness. Outside the city, about a mile hence, between the city and the Ganges, there is a place where we could build a palace for our king.” When the king heard this, he was pleased; for, he thought, “to fight with men inside the city is dangerous, it is impossible to distinguish friend from foe; but without the city it is easy to fight, therefore without the city I will smite them and kill them.” Then he said: “Good, my son, build in the place that you have seen.” “We will, sire. But your people must not come to the place where we build, in search of firewood or herbs or such like things; if they do, there is sure to be a quarrel, and this will be pleasant for neither of us.” “Very good, my son, forbid all access on that side.” “My lord, our elephants like to disport themselves in the water; if the water becomes muddy, and the people complain that since Mahosadha came we have had no clean water to drink, you must put up with it.” The king replied, “Let your elephants play.” Then he proclaimed by beat of drum, “Whosoever shall go hence to the place where the sage Mahosadha is building, he shall be fined a thousand pieces.”*";
P_HTM[1701]="***Then the Great Being took leave of the king, and with his attendants went out of the city, and began to build a city on the spot that had been set apart. On the other side of the Ganges he built a village called Gaggali: there he stationed his elephants, horses and chariots, his kine and oxen. He busied himself with the making of the city, and assigned to each their task. Having distributed all the work, he set about making the great tunnel; the mouth of which was upon the Ganges’ bank.*";
P_HTM[1702]="***Sixty thousand warriors were digging the great tunnel: the earth they removed in leather sacks and dropped in the river, and whenever the earth was dropped in the elephants trampled it underfoot, and the Ganges ran muddy. The citizens complained that, since Mahosadha had come, they could get no clean water to drink; the river ran muddy, and what was to be done? Then the wise man’s spies told them that Mahosadha’s elephants were playing about in the water, and stirring up the mud, and that was why it ran muddy. Now the intentions of the Bodhisattas are always fulfilled; therefore in the tunnel all roots and stones sank into the earth.*";
P_HTM[1703]="***The entrance to the lesser tunnel was in that city; seven hundred men were digging at the lesser tunnel; the earth they brought out in leather sacks and dropped in the city, and as they dropped each load, they mixed it with water, and built a wall, and used it for other works. The entrance into the greater tunnel was in the city: it was provided with a door, eighteen hands high, fitted with machinery, so that one peg being pressed all were closed up.*";
P_HTM[1704]="***On either side, the tunnel was built up with bricks and worked with stucco; it was roofed over with planks and smeared with cement, and whitened. In all there were eighty great doors and sixty-four small doors, which all by the pressure of one peg closed, and by the pressure of one peg opened. On either side there were some hundreds of lamp-cells, also fitted with machinery, so that when one was opened all opened, and when one was shut all were shut. On either side were a hundred and one chambers for a hundred and one warriors: in each one was laid a bed of various colours, in each was a great couch shaded by a white sunshade, each had a throne near the great couch, each had a statue of a woman, very beautiful – without touching them no one could tell they were not human. Moreover, in the tunnel on either side, clever painters made all manner of paintings: the splendour of Sakka, the zones of Mount Sineru, the sea and the ocean, the four continents, the Himālayas, Lake Anotatta, the Vermilion Mountain, the Sun and Moon, the heaven of the Four Great Kings with the six heavens of sense and their divisions – all were to be seen in the tunnel. The floor was strewn with sand white as a silver plate, and on the roof full-blown lotus flowers. On both sides were booths of all sorts; here and there hung festoons of flowers and scented blooms. Thus they adorned the tunnel until it was like the divine hall of Sudhamma.*";
P_HTM[1705]="***Now those three hundred wrights, having built three hundred ships, freighted them with loads of articles already prepared, and brought them down, and told the sage. He used them in the city, and made them put up the ships in a secret place to bring them out when he should give the word. In the city, the water-moat, the wall, gate and tower, dwellings for prince and people, elephant-stables, tanks, all were finished. So great tunnel and little tunnel, and all the city, were finished in four months. And at the end of the four months, the Great Being sent a messenger to the king, to bid him come.*";
P_HTM[1706]="***When the king heard this message, he was pleased, and set out with a large company.*";
P_HTM[1707]="***The Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[1708]="***133. “Then the king set out with an army in four divisions, to visit the prosperous city of Kampilliyā, with its innumerable chariots.”*";
P_HTM[1709]="***In due time he arrived at the Ganges. Then the Great Being went out to meet him, and conducted him to the city which he had built. The king entered the palace, and ate a rich meal, and after resting a little, in the evening sent a messenger to king Cullaṇī to say that he had come.*";
P_HTM[1710]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[1711]="***134. “Then he on arriving sent word to Brahmadatta: ‘Mighty king, I am come to salute your feet.*";
P_HTM[1712]="***135. Now give me to wife that woman most beauteous, full of grace, attended by her handmaidens.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1713]="***Cullaṇī was very glad at the message, and thought: “Where will my enemy go now? I shall cleave both their heads, and drink the cup of victory!” But he showed only joy to the messenger, and did him respect, and recited the following verse:*";
P_HTM[1714]="***136. “Welcome are you, Vedeha, a good coming is thine! Enquire now for a lucky hour, and I will give you my daughter, full of grace, attended by her handmaidens.”*";
P_HTM[1715]="***The messenger now went back to Vedeha, and said: “My lord, the king says, “Enquire for an hour suited to this auspicious event, and I will give you my daughter.” He sent the man back, saying: “This very day is a lucky hour!”*";
P_HTM[1716]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[1717]="***137. “Then king Vedeha enquired for a lucky hour; which done, he sent word to Brahmadatta:*";
P_HTM[1718]="***138. ‘Give me now to wife that woman most beauteous, full of grace, attended by her handmaidens.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1719]="***And king Cullaṇī said:*";
P_HTM[1720]="***139. “I give you now to wife that woman most beauteous, full of grace, attended by her handmaidens.”*";
P_HTM[1721]="***But in saying: “I will send her now, even now,” he lied; and he gave the word to the hundred and one kings, “Make ready for battle with your eighteen mighty hosts, and come forth; we will cleave the heads of our two enemies, and drink the cup of victory!” And he placed in the palace his mother queen Talatā, and his consort queen Nandā, and his son Pañcālacaṇḍa, and his daughter Pañcālacaṇḍī, with the women, and came forth himself.*";
P_HTM[1722]="***The Bodhisatta treated very hospitably the great army which came with king Vedeha: some were drinking spirits, some eating fish and flesh, some lay wearied with their long march; but king Vedeha, with Senaka and the other wise men, sat on a goodly dais amidst his courtiers. But king Cullaṇī surrounded the city in four lines with three intervals, and kindled several hundreds of thousands of torches, and there they stood, ready to take it when the sun should rise. On learning this, the Great Being gave commission to three hundred of his own warriors, “Go by the little tunnel, and bring in by that tunnel the king’s mother and consort, his son and daughter; take them through the great tunnel, but do not let them out by the door of the great tunnel; keep them safe in the tunnel until we come, but when we come, bring them out of the tunnel, and place them in the Great Court.”*";
P_HTM[1723]="***When they had received these commands, they went along the lesser tunnel, and pushed up the platform beneath the staircase; they seized the guards at the top and bottom of the staircase and on the terrace, the humpbacks, and all the others that were there, bound them hand and foot, gagged them, and hid them away here and there; ate some of the food prepared for the king, destroyed the rest, and went up to the terrace.*";
P_HTM[1724]="***Now queen Talatā on that day, uncertain what might befall, had made queen Nandā and the son and daughter lie with her in one bed. These warriors, standing at the door of the chamber, called to them. She came out and said: “What is it, my children?” They said: “Madam, our king has killed Vedeha and Mahosadha, and has made one kingdom in all Jambudīpa, and surrounded by the hundred and one princes in great glory he is drinking deep: he has sent us to bring you four to him also.” They came down to the foot of the staircase.*";
P_HTM[1725]="***When the men took them into the tunnel, they said: “All this time we have lived here, and never have entered this street before!” The men replied, “Men do not go into this street every day; this is a street of rejoicing, and because this is a day of rejoicing, the king told us to fetch you by this way.” And they believed it. Then some of the men conducted the four, others returned to the palace, broke open the treasury, and carried off all the precious things they wanted. The four went on by the greater tunnel, and seeing it to be like the glorious hall of the gods, thought that it had been made for the king. Then they were brought to a place not far from the river, and placed in a fine chamber within the tunnel; some kept watch over them, others went and told the Bodhisatta of their arrival.*";
P_HTM[1726]="***“Now,” thought the Bodhisatta, “my heart’s desire shall be fulfilled.” Highly pleased, he went into the king’s presence and stood on one side. The king, uneasy with desire, was thinking: “Now he will send his daughter, now, now,” and getting up he looked out of the window. There was the city all one blaze of light with those thousands of torches, and surrounded by a great host! In fear and suspicion he cried, “What is this?” and recited a verse to his wise men: 140. “Elephants, horses, chariots, footmen, a host in armour stands there, torches blaze with light; what do they mean, wise sirs?”*";
P_HTM[1727]="***To this Senaka replied, “Do not trouble, sire: large numbers of torches are blazing; I suppose the king is bringing his daughter to you.” And Pukkusa said: “No doubt he wishes to show honour at your visit, and therefore has come with a guard.” They told him whatever they liked. But the king heard the words of command, “Put a detachment here, set a guard there, be vigilant!” and he saw the soldiers under arms; so that he was frightened to death, and longing to hear some word from the Great Being, he recited another verse:*";
P_HTM[1728]="***141. “Elephants, horses, chariots, footmen, a host in armour stands there, torches ablaze with light: what will they do, wise sir?”*";
P_HTM[1729]="***Then the Great Being thought: “I will first terrify this blind fool for a little, then I will show my power and console him.” So he said,*";
P_HTM[1730]="***142. “Sire, the mighty Cullaṇī is watching you, Brahmadatta is a traitor: in the morning he will slay you.”*";
P_HTM[1731]="***On hearing this all were frightened to death: the king’s throat was parched, the spittle ceased, his body burnt; frightened to death and whimpering he recited two verses:*";
P_HTM[1732]="***143. “My heart throbs, my mouth is parched, I cannot rest, I am like one burnt in the fire and then put in the sun.*";
P_HTM[1733]="***144. As the smith’s fire burns inwardly and is not seen outside, so my heart burns within me and is not seen outside.”*";
P_HTM[1734]="***When the Great Being heard this lament, he thought: “This blind fool would not do my bidding at other times; I will punish him still more,” and he said:*";
P_HTM[1735]="***145. “Warrior, you are careless, neglectful of advice, unwise: now let your clever advisers save you.*";
P_HTM[1736]="***146. A king who will not do the bidding of a wise and faithful counsellor, being bent on his own pleasure, is like a deer caught in a trap.*";
P_HTM[1737]="***147. As a fish, greedy for the bait, does not notice the hook hidden in the meat which is wrapped round it, does not recognise its own death:*";
P_HTM[1738]="***148. So you, O king, greedy with lust, like the fish, do not recognise Cullaṇī’s daughter as your own death.*";
P_HTM[1739]="***149. If you go to Pañcāla, (I said,) you will speedily lose your happiness, as a deer caught on the highway will fall into great danger.*";
P_HTM[1740]="***150. A bad man, my lord, would bite you like a snake in your lap; no wise man should make friends with him; unhappy must be the association with an evil man.*";
P_HTM[1741]="***151. Whatsoever man, my lord; one should recognise for virtuous and instructed, he is the man for the wise to make his friend: happy would be the association with a good man.”*";
P_HTM[1742]="***Then to drive home the reproach, that a man should not be so treated, he recalled the words which the king had once said before, and went on:*";
P_HTM[1743]="***152. “Foolish you are, O king, deaf and dumb, that did upbraid my best advice, asking how I could know what was good like another, when I had grown up at the plow-tail?*";
P_HTM[1744]="***153. Take that fellow by the neck, you said, and cast him out of my kingdom, who tries by his talk to keep me from getting a precious thing!”*";
P_HTM[1745]="***Having recited these two verses, he said: “Sire, how could I, a clodhopper, know what is good as Senaka does and the other wise men? That is not my calling. I only know the clodhopper’s trade, but this matter is known to Senaka and his like; they are wise gentlemen, and now today let them deliver you from the eighteen mighty hosts that compass you round about; and bid them take me by the throat and cast me forth. Why do you ask me now?” Thus he rebuked him mercilessly. When the king heard it, he thought: “The sage is reciting the wrongs that I have done. Long ago he knew the danger to come, that is why he so bitterly reproaches me. But he cannot have spent all this time idly; surely he must have arranged for my safety.” So to reproach the other, he recited two verses:*";
P_HTM[1746]="***154. “Mahosadha, the wise do not throw up the past in one’s teeth; why do you goad me like a horse tied fast?*";
P_HTM[1747]="***155. If you see deliverance or safety, comfort me: why throw up the past against me?”*";
P_HTM[1748]="***Then the Great Being thought: “This king is very blind and foolish, and knows not the differences amongst men: a while I will torment him, then I will save him,” and he said:*";
P_HTM[1749]="***156. “ ’Tis too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot deliver you, and you must decide for yourself.*";
P_HTM[1750]="***157. There are elephants which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.*";
P_HTM[1751]="***158. Horses there are which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.*";
P_HTM[1752]="***159. Birds there are which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.*";
P_HTM[1753]="***160. Yakkhas there are which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.*";
P_HTM[1754]="***161. But it is too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot save you, and you must decide for yourself.”*";
P_HTM[1755]="***The king, hearing this, sat still without a word; but Senaka thought: “There is no help but the sage for the king or for us; but the king is too much afraid to be able to answer him. Then I will ask him.” And he asked him in two verses:*";
P_HTM[1756]="***162. “A man who cannot see the shore in the mighty ocean, when he finds a footing is full of joy.*";
P_HTM[1757]="***163. So to us and the king you, Mahosadha, are firm ground to stand on; you are our best of counsellors; deliver us from woe.”*";
P_HTM[1758]="***The Great Being reproached him in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1759]="***164. “ ’Tis too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot deliver you, and you must decide for yourself, Senaka.”*";
P_HTM[1760]="***The king, unable to find an opening, and terrified out of his life, could not say a word to the Great Being; but thinking that perhaps Senaka might have a plan, he asked him in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1761]="***165. “Hear this word of mine: you see this great danger, and now Senaka, I ask you – what do you think ought to be done here?”*";
P_HTM[1762]="***Senaka thinking: “The king asks for a plan: good or bad, I will tell him one,” recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1763]="***166. “Let us set fire to the door, let us take a sword, let us wound one another, and soon we shall cease to live: let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death.”*";
P_HTM[1764]="***The king fell in a passion to hear this, “That will do for your funeral pyre and your children’s,” he thought; and he then asked Pukkusa and the rest, who also spoke foolishly each after his own kind; here is the tradition:*";
P_HTM[1765]="***167. “Hear this word: you see this great danger. Now I ask Pukkusa – what do you think ought to be done here?*";
P_HTM[1766]="***168. Let us take poison and die, and we shall soon cease to live: let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death.*";
P_HTM[1767]="***169-171. Now I ask Kāvinda. Let us fasten a noose and die, let us cast ourselves from a height, let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death. Now I ask Devinda.*";
P_HTM[1768]="***172. Let us set fire to the door, let us take a sword, let us wound one another, and soon we shall cease to live: I cannot save us, but Mahosadha can do so easily.”*";
P_HTM[1769]="***Devinda thought: “What is the king doing? Here is fire, and he blows at a firefly! Except Mahosadha, there is none other can save us: yet he leaves him and asks us! What do we know about it?” Thus thinking, and seeing no other plan, he repeated the plan proposed by Senaka, and praised the Great Being in two verses:*";
P_HTM[1770]="***173. “This is my meaning, sire: Let us all ask the wise man; and if for all our asking Mahosadha cannot easily save us, then let us follow Senaka’s advice.”*";
P_HTM[1771]="***On hearing this, the king remembered his ill-treatment of the Bodhisatta, and being unable to speak to him, he lamented in his hearing thus:*";
P_HTM[1772]="***174-175. “As one that searches for sap in the plantain tree or the silk-cotton tree, finds none; so we searching for an answer to this problem have found none.*";
P_HTM[1773]="***176. Our dwelling is in a bad place, like elephants in a place where no water is, with worthless men and fools that know nothing.*";
P_HTM[1774]="***177. My heart throbs, my mouth is parched, I cannot rest, I am like one burnt in the fire and then put in the sun.*";
P_HTM[1775]="***178. As the smith’s fire burns inwardly and is not seen outside, so my heart burns within and is not seen outside.”*";
P_HTM[1776]="***Then the sage thought: “The king is exceedingly troubled: If I do not console him, he will break his heart and die.” So he consoled him.*";
P_HTM[1777]="***This the Teacher explained by saying:*";
P_HTM[1778]="***179. “Then this wise sage Mahosadha, discerning of the good, when he beheld Vedeha sorrowful thus spake to him:*";
P_HTM[1779]="***180-185. ‘Fear not, O king, fear not, lord of chariots; I will set you free, like the moon when it is caught by Rāhu, like the sun when it is caught by Rāhu, like an elephant sunk in the mud, like a snake shut up in a basket, like fish in the net.*";
P_HTM[1780]="***186. I will set you free with your chariots and your army; I will scare away Pañcāla, as a crow is scared by a clod.*";
P_HTM[1781]="***187. Of what use indeed is the wisdom or the counsellor of such a kind as cannot set you free from trouble when you are in difficulties?’ ”*";
P_HTM[1782]="***When he heard this, he was comforted, “Now my life is safe!” he thought; all were delighted when the Bodhisatta spoke out like a lion. Then Senaka asked, “Wise sir, how will you get away with us all?” “By a decorated tunnel,” he said, “make ready.” So saying, he gave the word to his men to open the tunnel:*";
P_HTM[1783]="***188. “Come, men, up and open the mouth of the entrance: Vedeha with his court is to go through the tunnel.”*";
P_HTM[1784]="***Up rose they and opened the door of the tunnel, and all the tunnel shone in a blaze of light like the decorated hall of the gods. The Teacher explained it by saying:*";
P_HTM[1785]="***189. “Hearing the wise man’s voice, his followers opened the tunnel door and the mechanical bolts.”*";
P_HTM[1786]="***The door opened, they told the Great Being, and he gave the word to the king, “Time, my lord! Come down from the terrace.” The king came down, Senaka took off his headdress, unloosed his gown. The Great Being asked him what he did; he replied, “Wise sir, when a man goes through a tunnel, he must take off his turban and wrap his clothes tight around him.” The other replied, “Senaka, do not suppose that you must crawl through the tunnel upon your knees. If you wish to go on an elephant, mount your elephant: lofty is our tunnel, eighteen hands high, with a wide door; dress yourself as fine as you will, and go in front of the king.” Then the Bodhisatta made Senaka go first, and went himself last, with the king in the middle, and this was the reason: in the tunnel was a world of eatables and drinkables, and the men ate and drank as they gazed at the tunnel, saying: “Do not go quickly, but gaze at the decorated tunnel,” but the Great Being went behind urging the king to go on, while the king went on gazing at the tunnel adorned like the hall of the gods.*";
P_HTM[1787]="***The Teacher explained it, saying,*";
P_HTM[1788]="***190. “In front went Senaka, behind went Mahosadha, and in the midst king Vedeha with the men of his court.”*";
P_HTM[1789]="***Now when the king’s coming was known, the men brought out of the tunnel the other king’s mother and wife, son and daughter, and set them in the great courtyard; the king also with the Bodhisatta came out of the tunnel. When these four saw the king and the sage, they were frightened to death, and shrieked in their fear, “Without doubt we are in the hands of our enemies! It must have been the wise man’s soldiers who came for us!” And king Cullaṇī, in fear lest Vedeha should escape – now he was about a mile from the Ganges – hearing their outcry in the quiet night, wished to say, “It is like the voice of queen Nandā!” but he feared that he might be laughed at for thinking such a thing, and said nothing. At that moment, the Great Being placed princess Pañcālacaṇḍī upon a heap of treasure, and administered the ceremonial sprinkling, as he said: “Sire, here is she for whose sake you came; let her be your queen!” They brought out the three hundred ships; the king came from the wide courtyard and boarded a ship richly decorated, and these four went on board with him. The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[1790]="***191. “Vedeha coming forth from the tunnel went aboard ship, and when he was aboard, Mahosadha thus encouraged him:*";
P_HTM[1791]="***192. ‘This is now your father-in-law, my lord, this is your mother-in-law, O master of men: as you would treat your mother, so treat your mother-in-law.*";
P_HTM[1792]="***193. As a brother by the same father and mother, so protect Pañcālacaṇḍa, O lord of chariots.*";
P_HTM[1793]="***194. Pañcālacaṇḍī is a royal princess, much wooed; love her, she is your wife, O lord of chariots.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1794]="***The king consented. But why did the Great Being say nothing about the queen-mother? Because she was an old woman. Now all this the Bodhisatta said as he stood upon the bank. Then the king, delivered from great trouble, wishing to proceed in the ship, said: “My son, you speak standing upon the shore,” and recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1795]="***195. “Come aboard with speed: why do you stand on the bank? From danger and trouble we have been delivered; now, Mahosadha, let us go.”*";
P_HTM[1796]="***The Great Being replied, “My lord, it is not meet that I go with you,” and he said,*";
P_HTM[1797]="***196. “This is not right, sire, that I, the leader of an army, should desert my army and come myself.*";
P_HTM[1798]="***197. All this army, left behind in the town, I will bring away with the consent of Brahmadatta.”*";
P_HTM[1799]="***Amongst these men, some are sleeping for weariness after their long journey, some eating and drinking, and know not of our departure, some are sick, after having worked with me four months, and there are many assistants of mine. I cannot go if I leave one man behind me; no, I will return, and all that army I will bring off with Brahmadatta’s consent, without a blow. You, sire, should go with all speed, not tarrying anywhere; I have stationed relays of elephants and conveyances on the road, so that you may leave behind those that are weary, and with others ever fresh may quickly return to Mithilā.”*";
P_HTM[1800]="***Then the king recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1801]="***198. “A small army against a great, how will you prevail? The weak will be destroyed by the strong, wise sir!”*";
P_HTM[1802]="***Then the Bodhisatta recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1803]="***199. “A small army with counsel conquers a large army that has none, one king conquers many, the rising sun conquers the darkness.”*";
P_HTM[1804]="***With these words, the Great Being saluted the king, and sent him away. The king remembering how he had been delivered from the hands of enemies, and by winning the princess had attained his heart’s desire, reflecting on the Bodhisatta’s virtues, in joy and delight described to Senaka the wise man’s virtues in this verse:*";
P_HTM[1805]="***200. “Happiness truly comes, O Senaka, by living with the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of my enemies.”*";
P_HTM[1806]="***To this Senaka replied with another, praising the sage:*";
P_HTM[1807]="***201. “Even so, sire, there is happiness amongst the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.”*";
P_HTM[1808]="***Then Vedeha crossed over the river, and at a league’s distance he found the village which the Bodhisatta had prepared; there the men posted by the Bodhisatta supplied elephants and other transport and gave them food and drink. He sent back elephants or horses and transport when they were exhausted, and took others, and proceeded to the next village; and in this way he traversed the journey of a hundred leagues, and next morning he was in Mithilā.*";
P_HTM[1809]="***But the Bodhisatta went to the gate of the tunnel; and drawing his sword, which was slung over his shoulder, he buried it in the sand, at the gate of the tunnel; then he entered the tunnel, and went into the town, and bathed him in scented water, and ate a choice meal, and retired to his goodly couch, glad to think that the desire of his heart had been fulfilled. When the night was ended, king Cullaṇī gave his orders to the army, and came up to the city. The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[1810]="***202. “The mighty Cullaṇī watched all night, and at sunrise approached Upakārī.*";
P_HTM[1811]="***203-204. Mounting his noble elephant, strong, sixty years old, Cullaṇī, mighty king of Pañcāla, addressed his army; fully armed with jewelled harness, an arrow in his hand, he addressed his men collected in great numbers.”*";
P_HTM[1812]="***Then to describe them in kind:*";
P_HTM[1813]="***205. “Men mounted on elephants, lifeguardsmen, charioteers, footmen, men skilful in archery, bowmen, all gathered together.”*";
P_HTM[1814]="***Now the king commanded them to take Vedeha alive:*";
P_HTM[1815]="***206. “Send the tusked elephants, mighty, sixty years old, let them trample down the city which Vedeha has nobly built.*";
P_HTM[1816]="***207. Let the arrows fly this way and that way, sped by the bow, arrows like the teeth of calves, sharp-pointed, piercing the very bones.*";
P_HTM[1817]="***208. Let heroes come forth in armour clad, with weapons finely decorated, bold and heroic, ready to face an elephant.*";
P_HTM[1818]="***209. Spears bathed in oil, their points glittering like fire, stand gleaming like the constellation of a hundred stars.*";
P_HTM[1819]="***210. At the onset of such heroes, with mighty weapons, clad in mail and armour, who never run away, how shall Vedeha escape, even if he fly like a bird?*";
P_HTM[1820]="***211. My thirty and nine thousand warriors, all picked men, whose like I never saw, all my mighty host.*";
P_HTM[1821]="***212. See the mighty tusked elephants, caparisoned, of sixty years, on whose backs are the brilliant and goodly princes.*";
P_HTM[1822]="***213-215. Brilliant are they on their backs, as the Devaputtas in Nandana, with glorious ornaments, glorious dress and robes: swords of the colour of the sheat-fish, well oiled, glittering, held fast by mighty men, well-finished, very sharp, shining, spotless, made of tempered steel, strong, held by mighty men who strike and strike again.*";
P_HTM[1823]="***216. In golden trappings and blood-red girths they gleam as they turn like lightning in a thick cloud.*";
P_HTM[1824]="***217-218. Mailed heroes with banners waving, skilled in the use of sword and shield, grasping the hilt, accomplished soldiers, mighty fighters on elephant-back, encompassed by such as these you have no escape; I see no power by which you can come to Mithilā.”*";
P_HTM[1825]="***Thus he threatened Vedeha, thinking to capture him then and there; and goading his elephant, bidding the army seize and strike and kill, king Cullaṇī came like a flood to the city of Upakārī.*";
P_HTM[1826]="***Then the Great Being’s spies thought: “Who knows what will happen?” and with their attendants surrounded him. Just then the Bodhisatta rose from his bed, and attended to his bodily needs, and after breakfast adorned and dressed himself, putting on his Kāsi robe worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, and with his red robe over one shoulder, and holding his presentation staff inlaid with the seven precious jewels, golden sandals upon his feet, and being fanned with a yaks-tail fan like some Devaccharā richly arrayed, came up on the terrace, and opening a window showed himself to king Cullaṇī, as he walked to and fro with the grace of the King of the Devas. And king Cullaṇī, seeing his beauty, could not find peace of mind, but quickly drove up his elephant, thinking that he should take him now. The sage thought: “He has hastened here expecting that Vedeha is caught; he knows not that his own children are taken, and that our king is gone. I will show my face like a golden mirror, and speak to him.” So standing at the window, he uttered these words in a voice sweet as honey:*";
P_HTM[1827]="***219. “Why have you driven up your elephant thus in haste? You come with a glad look; you think that you have got what you want.*";
P_HTM[1828]="***220. Throw down that bow, put away that arrow, put off that shining armour set with jewels and coral.”*";
P_HTM[1829]="***When he heard the man’s voice, he thought: “The clodhopper is making fun of me; today I will see what is to be done with him,” then threatened him, saying:*";
P_HTM[1830]="***221. “Your countenance looks pleased, you speak with a smile. It is in the hour of death that such beauty is seen.”*";
P_HTM[1831]="***As they thus talked together, the soldiers noticed the Great Being’s beauty, “Our king,” they said, “is talking with wise Mahosadha; what can it be about? Let us listen to their talk.” So they drew near the king. But the sage, when the king had finished speaking, replied, “You do not know that I am the wise Mahosadha. I will not suffer you to kill me. Your plan is thwarted; what was thought in the heart of you and Kevaṭṭa has not come to pass, but that has come to pass which you said with your lips.” And he explained this by saying,*";
P_HTM[1832]="***222. “Your thunders are in vain, O king! Your plan is thwarted, man of war! The king is as hard for you to catch as a thoroughbred for a hack.*";
P_HTM[1833]="***223. Our king crossed the Ganges yesterday, with his courtiers and attendants. You will be like a crow trying to chase the royal goose.”*";
P_HTM[1834]="***Again, like a maned lion without fear, he gave an illustration in these words:*";
P_HTM[1835]="***224. “Jackals, in the night time, seeing the Flame of the Forest in flower, think the flowers to be lumps of meat, and gather in troops, these vilest of beasts.*";
P_HTM[1836]="***225. When the watches of the night are past, and the sun has risen, they see the Flame of the Forest in flower, and lose their wish, those vilest of beasts.*";
P_HTM[1837]="***226. Even so you, O king, for all that you have surrounded Vedeha, shall lose your wish and go, as the jackals went from the Flame of the Forest.”*";
P_HTM[1838]="***When the king heard his fearless words, he thought: “The clodhopper is bold enough in his speech: no doubt Vedeha must have escaped.” He was very angry. “Long ago,” he thought, “through this clodhopper I had not so much as a rag to cover me; now by his doing my enemy who was in my hands has escaped. In truth he has done me much evil, and I will be revenged on him for both.” Then he gave orders as follows:*";
P_HTM[1839]="***227-228. “Cut off his hands and feet, ears and nose, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy from my hands; cut off his flesh and cook it on skewers, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hands.*";
P_HTM[1840]="***229-230. As a bull’s hide is spread out on the ground, or a lion’s or tiger’s fastened flat with pegs, so I will peg him out and pierce him with spikes, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hand.”*";
P_HTM[1841]="***The Great Being smiled when he heard this, and thought: “This king does not know that his queen and family have been conveyed by me to Mithilā, and so he is giving all these orders about me. But in his anger he might transfix me with an arrow, or do something else that might please him; I will therefore overwhelm him with pain and sorrow, and will make him faint on his elephant’s back, while I tell him about it.” So he said:*";
P_HTM[1842]="***231-234. “If you cut off my hands and feet, my ears and nose, so will Vedeha deal with Pañcālacaṇḍa, so with Pañcālacaṇḍī, so with queen Nandā, your wife and children.*";
P_HTM[1843]="***235-238. If you cut off my flesh and cook it on skewers, so will Vedeha cook that of Pañcālacaṇḍa, of Pañcālacaṇḍī, of queen Nandā, your wife and children.*";
P_HTM[1844]="***239-242. If you peg me out and pierce me with spikes, so will Vedeha deal with Pañcālacaṇḍa, with Pañcālacaṇḍī, with queen Nandā, your wife and children. So it has been secretly arranged between Vedeha and me.*";
P_HTM[1845]="***243. Like as a leather shield of a hundred layers, carefully wrought by the leather-workers, is a defence to keep off arrows.*";
P_HTM[1846]="***244. So I bring happiness and avert trouble from glorious Vedeha, and I keep off your devices as a shield keeps off an arrow.”*";
P_HTM[1847]="***Hearing this, the king thought: “What is this clodhopper talking of? As I do to him, indeed, so king Vedeha will do to my family? He does not know that I have set a careful guard over my family, but he is only threatening me in fear of instant death. I don’t believe what he says.”*";
P_HTM[1848]="***The Great Being divined that he thought him to be speaking in fear, and resolved to explain. So he said:*";
P_HTM[1849]="***245. “Come, sire, see your inner apartments are empty: wife, children, mother, O warrior, were carried through a tunnel and put in charge of Vedeha.”*";
P_HTM[1850]="***Then the king thought: “The sage speaks with much assurance. I did hear in the night beside the Ganges the voice of queen Nandā; very wise is the sage, perhaps he speaks the truth!” Great grief came upon him, but he gathered all his courage, and dissembling his grief, sent a courtier to enquire, and recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[1851]="***246. “Come, enter my inner apartments and enquire whether the man’s words be truth or lies.”*";
P_HTM[1852]="***The messenger with his attendants went, and opened the door, and entered; there with hands and feet bound, and gags in their mouths, hanging to pegs, he discovered the sentries of the inner apartments, the dwarfs and hunchbacks, and so forth: broken vessels were scattered about, with food and drink, the doors of the treasury were broken open, and the treasure plundered, the bedroom with open doors, and a tribe of crows which had come in by the open windows; it was like a deserted village, or a place of corpses. In this inglorious state he beheld the palace; and he told the news to the king, saying,*";
P_HTM[1853]="***247. “Even so, sire, as Mahosadha said: empty is your inner palace, like a waterside village inhabited by crows.”*";
P_HTM[1854]="***The king trembling with grief at the loss of his four dear ones, said: “This sorrow has come on me through the clodhopper!” and like a snake struck with a stick, he was exceedingly angry with the Bodhisatta. When the Great Being saw his appearance, he thought: “This king has great glory; if he should ever in anger say, “What do I want with so and so?” in a warrior’s pride he might hurt me. Suppose I should describe the beauty of queen Nandā to him, making as if he had never seen her; he would then remember her, and would understand that he would never recover this precious woman if he killed me. Then out of love to his spouse, he would do me no harm.” So standing for safety in the upper storey, he removed his golden-coloured hand from beneath his red robe, and pointing the way by which she went, he described her beauties thus:*";
P_HTM[1855]="***248. “This way, sire, went the woman beauteous in every limb, her lips like plates of gold, her voice like the music of the wild goose.*";
P_HTM[1856]="***249. This way was she taken, sire, the woman beauteous in every limb, clad in silken raiment, dark, with fair girdle of gold.*";
P_HTM[1857]="***250. Her feet reddened, fair to see, with girdles of gold and jewels, with eyes like a pigeon, slender, with lips like bimba fruit, and slender waist.*";
P_HTM[1858]="***251-252. Well-born, slender-waisted like a creeper or a place of sacrifice, her hair long, black, and a little curled at the end, well-born, like a fawn, like a flame of fire in winter time. Like a river hidden in the clefts of a mountain under the low reeds.*";
P_HTM[1859]="***253. Beauteous in nose or thigh, peerless, with breasts like the tindook fruit, not too long, not too short, not hairless and not too hairy.”*";
P_HTM[1860]="***As the Great Being thus praised her grace, it seemed to the king as if he had never seen her before: great longing arose in him, and the Great Being who perceived this recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[1861]="***254. “And so you are pleased at Nandā’s death, glorious king: now Nandā and I will go before Yama.”*";
P_HTM[1862]="***In all this the Great Being praised Nandā and no one else, and this was his reason: people never love others as they do a beloved wife; and he praised her only, because he thought that if the king remembered her he would remember his children also. When the wise Great Being praised her in this voice of honey, queen Nandā seemed to stand in person before the king. Then the king thought: “No other save Mahosadha can bring back my wife and give her to me,” as he remembered, sorrow came over him. Thereupon the Great Being said: “Be not troubled, sire: queen and son and mother shall all come back; my return is the only condition. Be comforted, majesty!” So he comforted the king; and the king said: “I watched and guarded my own city so carefully, I have surrounded this city of Upakārī with so great a host, yet this wise man has taken out of my guarded city queen and son and mother, and has handed them over to Vedeha! While we were besieging the city, without a single one’s knowing, he sent Vedeha away with his army and transport! Can it be that he knows magic, or how to delude the eyes?” And he questioned him thus:*";
P_HTM[1863]="***255. “Do you study the magical arts, or have you bewitched my eyes, that you have delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hand?”*";
P_HTM[1864]="***On hearing this, the Great Being said: “Sire, I do know magic, for wise men who have learned magic, when danger comes, deliver both themselves and others:*";
P_HTM[1865]="***256. Wise men, sire, learn magic in this world; they deliver themselves, wise men, full of counsel.*";
P_HTM[1866]="***257. I have young men who are clever at breaking barriers; by the way which they made for me Vedeha has gone to Mithilā.”*";
P_HTM[1867]="***This suggested that he had gone by the decorated tunnel; so the king said: “What is this underground way?” and wished to see it. The Great Being understood from his look that this was what he wanted, and offered to show it to him:*";
P_HTM[1868]="***258. “Come see, O king, a tunnel well made, big enough for elephants or horses, chariots or foot soldiers, brightly illuminated, a tunnel well built.”*";
P_HTM[1869]="***Then he went on, “Sire, behold the tunnel which was made by my knowledge: bright as though sun and moon rose within it, decorated, with eighty great doors and sixty-four small doors, with a hundred and one bedchambers, and many hundreds of lamp-niches; come with me in joy and delight, and with your guard enter the city of Upakārī.” With these words he caused the city gate to be thrown open; and the king with the hundred and one princes came in. The Great Being descended from the upper storey, and saluted the king, and led him with his retinue into the tunnel. When the king saw this tunnel like a decorated city of the gods, he spoke the praise of the Bodhisatta:*";
P_HTM[1870]="***259. “No small gain is it to that Vedeha, who has in his house or kingdom men so wise as you are, Mahosadha!”*";
P_HTM[1871]="***Then the Great Being showed him the hundred and one bedchambers: the door of one being opened, all opened, and one shut, all shut. The king went first, gazing at the tunnel, and the wise man went after; all the soldiers also entered the tunnel. But when the sage knew that the king had emerged from the tunnel, he kept the rest from coming out by going up to a handle and shutting the tunnel door: then the eighty great doors and the sixty-four small doors, and the doors of the hundred and one bedchambers, and the doors of the hundreds of lamp-niches all shut together; and the whole tunnel became dark as hell. All the great company were terrified.*";
P_HTM[1872]="***Now the Great Being took the sword, which he had hidden the day before as he entered the tunnel: eighteen cubits from the ground he leapt into the air, descended, and catching the king’s arm, brandished the sword, and frightened him, crying, “Sire, whose are all the kingdoms of Jambudīpa?” “Yours, wise sir! Spare me!” He replied, “Fear not, sire. I did not take up my sword from any wish to kill you, but in order to show my wisdom.” Then he handed his sword to the king, and when he had taken it, the other said: “If you wish to kill me, sire, kill me now with that sword; if you wish to spare me, spare me.” “Wise sir,” he replied, “I promise you safety, fear not.” So as he held the sword, they both struck up a friendship in all sincerity. Then the king said to the Bodhisatta, “Wise sir, with such wisdom as yours, why not seize the kingdom?” “Sire, if I wished it, this day I could take all the kingdoms of Jambudīpa and slay all the kings; but it is not the wise man’s part to gain glory by slaying others.” “Wise sir, a great multitude is in distress, being unable to get out; open the tunnel door and spare their lives.” He opened the door: all the tunnel became a blaze of light, the people were comforted, all the kings with their retinue came out and approached the sage, who stood in the wide courtyard with the king.*";
P_HTM[1873]="***Then those kings said: “Wise sir, you have given us our lives; if the door had remained shut for a little while longer, all would have died there.” “My lords, this is not the first time your lives have been saved by me.” “When, wise sir?” “Do you remember when all the kingdoms of Jambudīpa had been conquered except our city, and when you went to the park of Uttarapañcāla ready to drink the cup of victory?” “Yes, wise sir.” “Then this king, with Kevaṭṭa, by evil device had poisoned the drink and food, and intended to murder you; but I did not wish you to die a foul death before me; so I sent in my men, and broke all the vessels, and thwarted their plan, and gave you your lives.” They all in fear asked Cullaṇī, “Is this true, sire?” “Indeed what I did was by Kevaṭṭa’s advice; the sage speaks truth.” Then they all embraced the Great Being, and said: “Wise sir, you have been the saving of us all, you have saved our lives.” They all bestowed ornaments upon him in respect. The sage said to the king, “Fear not, sire; the fault lay in association with a wicked friend. Ask pardon of the kings.” The king said: “I did the thing because of a bad man: it was my fault; pardon me, never will I do such a thing again.” He received their pardon; they confessed their faults to each other, and became friends. Then the king sent for plenty of all sorts of food, perfumes and garlands, and for seven days they all took their pleasure in the tunnel, and entered the city, and did great honour to the Great Being; and the king surrounded by the hundred and one princes sat on a great throne, and desiring to keep the sage in his court, he said,*";
P_HTM[1874]="***260. “Support, and honour, double allowance of food and wages, and other great boons I give; eat and enjoy at will: but do not return to Vedeha; what can he do for you?”*";
P_HTM[1875]="***But the sage declined in these words:*";
P_HTM[1876]="***261. “When one deserts a patron, sire, for the sake of gain, it is a disgrace to both oneself and the other.*";
P_HTM[1877]="***262. While Vedeha lives I could not be another’s man; while Vedeha remains, I could not live in another’s kingdom.”*";
P_HTM[1878]="***Then the king said to him, “Well, sir, when your king attains to godhead, promise me to come here.” “If I live, I will come, sire.” So the king did him great honour for seven days, and after that as he took his leave, he recited a verse, promising to give him this and that:*";
P_HTM[1879]="***263. “I give you a thousand nikkhas of gold, eighty villages in Kāsi, four hundred female slaves, and a hundred wives. Take all your army, and go in peace, Mahosadha.”*";
P_HTM[1880]="***And he replied, “Sire, do not trouble about your family. When my king went back to his country, I told him to treat queen Nandā as his own mother, and Pañcālacaṇḍa as his younger brother, and I married your daughter to him with the ceremonial sprinkling. I will soon send back your mother, wife, and son.” “Good!” said the king, and gave him a dowry for his daughter, men slaves and women slaves, dress and ornaments, gold and precious metal, decorated elephants and horses and chariots. He then gave orders for the army to execute:*";
P_HTM[1881]="***264. “Let them give even double quantity to the elephants and horses, let them content charioteers and footmen with food and drink.”*";
P_HTM[1882]="***This said, he dismissed the sage with these words:*";
P_HTM[1883]="***265. “Go; wise sir, taking elephants, horses, chariots, and footmen; let king Vedeha see you back in Mithilā.”*";
P_HTM[1884]="***Thus he dismissed the sage with great honour. And the hundred and one kings did honour to the Great Being, and gave him rich gifts. And the spies who had been on service with them surrounded the sage. With a great company he set out; and on the way, he sent men to receive the revenues of those villages which king Cullaṇī had given him. Then he arrived at the kingdom of Vedeha.*";
P_HTM[1885]="***Now Senaka had placed a man in the way, to watch and see whether king Cullaṇī came or not, and to tell him of the coming of anyone. He saw the Great Being at three leagues off, and returning told how the sage was returning with a great company. With this news he went to the palace. The king also looking out by a window in the upper storey saw the great host, and was frightened. “The Great Being’s company is small, this is very large: can it be Cullaṇī come himself?” He put this question as follows:*";
P_HTM[1886]="***266. “Elephants, horses, chariots, footmen, a great army is visible, with four divisions, terrible in aspect; what does it mean, wise sirs?”*";
P_HTM[1887]="***Senaka replied:*";
P_HTM[1888]="***267. “The greatest joy is what you see, sire: Mahosadha is safe, with all his host.”*";
P_HTM[1889]="***The king said to this, “Senaka, the wise man’s army is small, this is very great.” “Sire, king Cullaṇī must have been pleased with him, and therefore must have given this host to him.” The king proclaimed through the city by beat of drum, “Let the city be decorated to welcome the return of the wise man.”*";
P_HTM[1890]="***The townspeople obeyed. The wise man entered the city and came to the king’s palace; then the king rose, and embraced him, and returning to his throne spoke pleasantly to him:*";
P_HTM[1891]="***268. “As four men leave a corpse in the cemetery, so we left you in the kingdom of Kampilliya and returned.*";
P_HTM[1892]="***269. But you – by what colour, or what means, or what device did you save yourself?”*";
P_HTM[1893]="***The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[1894]="***270. “By one purpose, Vedeha, I overmastered another, by plan I outdid plan, O warrior, and I encompassed the king as the ocean encompasses Jambudīpa.”*";
P_HTM[1895]="***This pleased the king. Then the other told him of the gift which king Cullaṇī had made:*";
P_HTM[1896]="***271. “A thousand nikkhas of gold were given to me, and eighty villages in Kāsi, four hundred slave women, and a hundred wives, and with all the army I have returned safe home.”*";
P_HTM[1897]="***Then the king, exceedingly pleased and overjoyed, uttered this exalted utterance in praise of the Great Being’s merit:*";
P_HTM[1898]="***272. “Happiness truly comes by living with the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.”*";
P_HTM[1899]="***Senaka answered him thus:*";
P_HTM[1900]="***273. “Even so, sire, there is happiness with a wise man. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from the net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.”*";
P_HTM[1901]="***Then the king set the drum of festival beating around the city, “Let there be a festival for seven days, and let all who have goodwill to me do honour and service to the wise man.” The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[1902]="***274. “Let them sound all manner of lutes, drums and tabors, let conchs of Magadha boom, merrily roll the kettledrums.”*";
P_HTM[1903]="***Townsfolk and countryfolk in general, eager to do honour to the sage, on hearing the proclamation made merry with a will. The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[1904]="***275. “Women and maids, vesiya and brahmin wives, brought plenty of food and drink to the sage.*";
P_HTM[1905]="***276-277. Elephant drivers, lifeguardsmen, charioteers, footmen, all did the like; and so did all the people from country and villages assembled.*";
P_HTM[1906]="***278. The multitude were glad to see the sage returned, and at his reception shawls were waved in the air.”*";
P_HTM[1907]="***At the end of the festival, the Great Being went to the palace and said: “Sire, king Cullaṇī’s mother and wife and son should be sent back at once.” “Very good, my son, send them back.” So he showed all respect to those three, and entertained also the host that had come with him; thus he sent the three back well attended, with his own men, and the hundred wives and the four hundred slave women whom the king had given him, he sent with queen Nandā, and the company that came with him he also sent. When this great company reached the city of Uttarapañcāla, the king asked his mother, “Did king Vedeha treat you well, my mother?” “My son, what are you saying? He treated me with the same honour as if I had been a Devatā.” Then she told how queen Nandā had been treated as a mother, and Pañcālacaṇḍa as a younger brother. This pleased the king very much, and he sent a rich gift; and from that time forward both lived in friendship and amity.*";
P_HTM[1908]="***The Question of the Water Rakkhasa*";
P_HTM[1909]="***Now Pañcālacaṇḍī was very dear and precious to the king; and in the second year she bore him a son. In his tenth year, king Vedeha died. The Bodhisatta raised the royal parasol for him, and asked leave to go to his grandfather, king Cullaṇī. The boy said: “Wise sir, do not leave me in my childhood; I will honour you as a father.” And Pañcālacaṇḍī said: “Wise sir, there is none to protect us if you go; do not go.” But he replied, “My promise has been given; I cannot but go.” So amidst the lamentations of the multitude, he departed with his servants, and came to Uttarapañcāla city. The king hearing of his arrival came to meet him, and led him into the city with great pomp, and gave him a great house, and besides the eighty villages given at first, gave him another present; and he served that king.*";
P_HTM[1910]="***At that time a wanderer, named Bherī, used to take her meals constantly in the palace; she was wise and learned, and she had never seen the Great Being before; she heard the report that the wise Mahosadha was serving the king. He also had never seen her before, but he heard that a wanderer named Bherī had her meals in the palace. Now queen Nandā was ill pleased with the Bodhisatta, because he had separated her from her husband’s love, and caused her annoyance; so she sent for five women whom she trusted, and said: “Watch for a fault in the wise man, and let us try to make him fall out with the king.” So they went about looking for an occasion against him.*";
P_HTM[1911]="***One day it so happened that this wanderer after her meal was going forth, and caught sight of the Bodhisatta in the courtyard on his way to wait on the king. He saluted her, and stood still. She thought: “This they say is a wise man: I will see whether he be wise or no.” So she asked him a question by a gesture of the hand: looking towards the Bodhisatta, she opened her hand. Her idea was to enquire whether the king took good care or not of this wise man whom he had brought from another country. When the Bodhisatta saw that she was asking him a question by gesture, he answered it by clenching his fist: what he meant was, “Your reverence, the king brought me here in fulfilment of a promise, and now he keeps his fist tight closed and gives me nothing.” She understood; and stretching out her hand she rubbed her head, as much as to say, “Wise sir, if you are displeased, why do you not become an ascetic like me?” At this the Great Being stroked his stomach, as who should say, “Your reverence, there are many that I have to support, and that is why I do not become an ascetic.” After this dumb questioning she returned to her dwelling, and the Great Being saluted her and went in to the king.*";
P_HTM[1912]="***Now the queen’s confidantes saw all this from a window; and coming before the king, they said: “My lord, Mahosadha has made a plot with Bherī the ascetic to seize your kingdom, and he is your enemy.” So they slandered him. “What have you heard or seen?” the king asked. They said: “Sire, as the ascetic was going out after her meal, seeing the Great Being, she opened her hand; as one who should say, ‘Cannot you crush the king flat like the palm of the hand or a threshing-floor, and seize the kingdom for yourself?’ And Mahosadha clenched his fist, making as though he held a sword, as one who should say, ‘In a few days I will cut off his head and get him into my power.’ She signalled, ‘Cut off his head,’ by rubbing her own head with her hand; the Great Being signalled, ‘I will cut him in half,’ by rubbing his belly. Be vigilant, sire! Mahosadha ought to be put to death.”*";
P_HTM[1913]="***The king, hearing this, thought: “I cannot hurt this wise man; I will question the ascetic.” Next day accordingly, at the time of her meal, he came up and asked, “Madam, have you seen wise Mahosadha?” “Yes, sire, yesterday, as I was going out after my meal.” “Did you have any conversation together?” “Conversation? No; but I had heard of his wisdom, and in order to try it I asked him, by dumb signs, shutting my hand, whether the king was open-handed to him or close-fisted, did he treat him with kindness or not. He closed his fist, implying that his master had made him come here in fulfilment of a promise, and now gave him nothing. Then I rubbed my head, to enquire why he did not become an ascetic if he were not satisfied; he stroked his belly, meaning that there were many for him to feed, many bellies to fill, and therefore he did not become an ascetic.” “And is Mahosadha a wise man?” “Yes, indeed, sire: in all the earth there is not his like for wisdom.” After hearing her account, the king dismissed her.*";
P_HTM[1914]="***After she had gone, the sage came to wait upon the king; and the king asked him, “Have you seen, sir, the wanderer Bherī?” “Yes, sire, I saw her yesterday on her way out, and she asked me a question by dumb signs, and I answered her at once.” And he told the story as she had done. The king in his pleasure that day gave him the post of commander-in-chief, and put him in sole charge. Great was his glory, second only to the king’s. He thought: “The king all at once has given me exceeding great renown; this is what kings do even when they wish to slay. Suppose I try the king to see whether he has goodwill towards me or not. No one else will be able to find this out; but the wanderer Bherī is full of wisdom, and she will find a way.”*";
P_HTM[1915]="***So taking a quantity of flowers and scents, he went to the wanderer and, after saluting her, said: “Madam, since you told the king of my merits, the king has overwhelmed me with splendid gifts; but whether he does it in sincerity or not I do not know. It would be well if you could find out for me the king’s mind.” She promised to do so; and next day, as she was going to the palace, the Question of the Water Rakkhasa (Dakarakkhasa) came into her mind. Then this occurred to her, “I must not be like a spy, but I must find an opportunity to ask the question, and discover whether the king has goodwill to the wise man.” So she went. And after her meal, she sat still, and the king saluting her sat down on one side. Then she thought: “If the king bears ill-will to the sage, and when he is asked the question if he declares his ill-will in the presence of a number of people, that will not do; I will ask him apart.” She said: “Sire, I wish to speak to you in private.” The king sent his attendants away. She said: “I want to ask your majesty a question.” “Ask, madam, and if I know the answer I will reply.” Then she recited the first verse in the Question of Dakarakkhasa:*";
P_HTM[1916]="***279. “If there were seven of you voyaging on the ocean, and a Yakkha seeking for a human sacrifice should seize the ship, in what order would you give them up and save yourself from the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1917]="***The king answered by another verse, in all sincerity:*";
P_HTM[1918]="***280. “First I would give my mother, next my wife, next my brother, fourth my friend, fifth my brahmin, sixth myself, but I would not give up Mahosadha.”*";
P_HTM[1919]="***Thus the ascetic discovered the goodwill of the king towards the Great Being; but his merit was not published thereby, so she thought of something else, “In a large company I will praise the merits of these others, and the king will praise the wise man’s merit instead; thus the wise man’s merit will be made as clear as the moon shining in the sky.” So she collected all the denizens of the inner palace, and in their presence asked the same question and received the same answer: then she said: “Sire, you say that you would give first your mother: but a mother is of great merit, and your mother is not as other mothers, she is very useful.” And she recited her merits in a couple of verses:*";
P_HTM[1920]="***281. “She reared you and she brought you forth, and for a long time was kind to you, when Chambhī offended against you she was wise and saw what was for your good, and by putting a counterfeit in your place she saved you from harm.*";
P_HTM[1921]="***282. Such a mother, who gave you life, your own mother who bore you in her womb, for what fault could you give her to the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1922]="***To this the king replied, “Many are my mother’s virtues, and I acknowledge her claims upon me, but mine are still more numerous,” and then he described her faults in a couple of verses:*";
P_HTM[1923]="***283-284. “Like a young girl she wears ornaments which she ought not to use, she mocks unseasonably at doorkeepers and guards, unbidden she sends messages to rival kings; and for these faults I would give her to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1924]="***“So be it, sire; yet your wife has much merit,” and she declared her merit thus:*";
P_HTM[1925]="***285-286. “She is chief amongst womankind, she is exceedingly gracious of speech, devoted, virtuous, who cleaves to you like your shadow, not given to anger, prudent, wise, who sees your good: for what fault would you give your wife to the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1926]="***He described her faults:*";
P_HTM[1927]="***287. “By her sensual attractions she has made me subject to evil influence, and asks what she should not for her sons.*";
P_HTM[1928]="***288. In my passion I give her many and many a gift; I relinquish what is very hard to give, and afterwards I bitterly repent: for that fault I would give my wife to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1929]="***The ascetic said: “Be it so, but your younger brother prince Tikhiṇamantī is useful to you; for what fault would you give him?*";
P_HTM[1930]="***289-290. “He who gave prosperity to the people, and when you were living in foreign parts brought you back home, he whom great wealth could not influence, peerless bowman and hero, Tikhiṇamantī: for what fault would you give your brother to the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1931]="***The king described his fault:*";
P_HTM[1932]="***291. “He thinks: ‘I gave prosperity to the people, I brought him back home when he was living in foreign parts, great wealth could not influence me.*";
P_HTM[1933]="***292. I am a peerless bowman and hero, and sharp in counsel, by me he was made king.’*";
P_HTM[1934]="***293. He does not come to wait on me, madam, as he used to do; that is the fault for which I would give my brother to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1935]="***The ascetic said: “So much for your brother’s fault, but prince Dhanusekha is devoted in his love for you, and very useful,” and she described his merit:*";
P_HTM[1936]="***294. “In one night both you and Dhanusekha were born here, both called Pañcāla, friends and companions:*";
P_HTM[1937]="***285. Through all your life he has followed you, your joy and pain were his, zealous and careful by night and day in all service: for what fault would you give your friend to the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1938]="***Then the king described his fault:*";
P_HTM[1939]="***286. “Madam, through all my life he used to make merry with me, and today also he makes free excessively for the same reason.*";
P_HTM[1940]="***287. If I talk in secret with my wife, in he comes unbidden and unannounced.*";
P_HTM[1941]="***288. Give him a chance and an opening, he acts shamelessly and disrespectfully. That is the fault for which I would give my friend to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1942]="***The ascetic said: “So much for his fault; but the family priest is very useful to you,” and she described his merit:*";
P_HTM[1943]="***289-290. “He is clever, knows all omens and sounds, skilled in signs and dreams, goings out and comings in, understands all the tokens in earth and air and stars: for what fault would you give the brahmin to the Water Rakkhasa?”*";
P_HTM[1944]="***The king explained his fault:*";
P_HTM[1945]="***291. “Even in company he stares at me with open eyes; therefore I would give this rascal with his puckered brows to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1946]="***Then the ascetic said: “Sire, you say you would give to the Water Rakkhasa all these five, beginning with your mother, and that you would give your own life for the wise Mahosadha, not taking into account your great glory: what merit do you see in him?” and she recited these verses:*";
P_HTM[1947]="***292-293. “Sire, you dwell amidst your courtiers in a great continent surrounded by the sea, with the ocean in place of an encircling wall: lord of the earth, with a mighty empire, victorious, sole emperor, your glory has become great.*";
P_HTM[1948]="***294. You have sixteen thousand women dressed in jewels and ornaments, women of all nations, resplendent like Devakaññās.*";
P_HTM[1949]="***295. Thus provided for every need, every desire fulfilled, you have lived long in happiness and bliss.*";
P_HTM[1950]="***296. Then by what reason or what cause do you sacrifice your precious life to protect the sage?”*";
P_HTM[1951]="***On hearing this, he recited the following verses in praise of the wise man’s merit:*";
P_HTM[1952]="***297. “Since Mahosadha, madam, came to me, I have not seen the steadfast man do the most trifling wrong.*";
P_HTM[1953]="***298. If I should die before him at any time, he would bring happiness to my sons and grandsons.*";
P_HTM[1954]="***299. He knows all things, past or future. This man without wrong I would not give to the Water Rakkhasa.”*";
P_HTM[1955]="***Thus this Jātaka came to its appropriate end. Then the ascetic thought: “This is not enough to show forth the wise man’s merits; I will make them known to all people in the city, like one that spreads scented oil over the surface of the sea.” So taking the king with her, she came down from the palace, and prepared a seat in the palace courtyard, and made him sit there; then gathering the people together, she asked the king that Question of the Water Rakkhasa over again from the beginning; and when he had answered it as described above, she addressed the people thus:*";
P_HTM[1956]="***300. “Hear this, men of Pañcāla, which Cullaṇī has said. To protect the wise man he sacrifices his own precious life.*";
P_HTM[1957]="***301. His mother’s life, his wife’s and his brother’s, his friend’s life and his own, Pañcāla is ready to sacrifice.*";
P_HTM[1958]="***302. So marvellous is the power of wisdom, so clever and so intelligent, for good in this world and for happiness in the next.”*";
P_HTM[1959]="***So like one that places the topmost pinnacle upon a heap of treasure, she put the pinnacle on her demonstration of the Great Being’s merit.*";
P_HTM[1960]="***This is the identification of the Jātaka,*";
P_HTM[1961]="***“Uppalavaṇṇī was Bherī, Suddhodana was the wise man’s father,*";
P_HTM[1962]="***Mahāmāyā his mother, the beautiful Bimbā was Amarā,*";
P_HTM[1963]="***Ānanda was the parrot, Sāriputta was Cullaṇī,*";
P_HTM[1964]="***Mahosadha was the lord of the world: thus understand the Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[1965]="***Devadatta was Kevaṭṭa, Cullanandikā was Talatā,*";
P_HTM[1966]="***Sundarī was Pañcālacaṇḍī, Yasassikā was the queen,*";
P_HTM[1967]="***Ambaṭṭha was Kāvinda, Poṭṭhapāda was Pukkusa,*";
P_HTM[1968]="***Pilotika was Devinda, Saccaka was Senaka,*";
P_HTM[1969]="***Diṭṭhamangalikā was queen Udumbarā,*";
P_HTM[1970]="***Kuṇḍalī was the mynah bird, and Lāḷudāyī was Vedeha.”*";
P_HTM[1971]="* 10. Vessantarajātakavaṇṇanā** The Story about (the Great King) Vessantara (Mahānipāta)*";
P_HTM[1972]="***“Ten boons.” This story the Teacher told while dwelling near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Grove, about a shower of rain.*";
P_HTM[1973]="***When the Teacher turned the precious Wheel of the Dhamma and came in due course to Rājagaha, where he spent the winter, with elder Udāyi leading the way, and attended by twenty thousand saints, he entered Kapilavatthu: whereupon the Sakya princes gathered together to see the chief of their clan. They inspected the Fortunate One’s abode, saying: “A delightful place this Banyan Grove, worthy of Sakka.” Then they made all due provision for guarding it; and making ready to meet him with fragrant posies in their hands, they sent first all the youngest boys and girls of the township dressed in their best, next the princes and princesses, and amongst these themselves did honour to the Teacher with fragrant flowers and powders, escorting the Fortunate One as far as the Banyan Park; where the Fortunate One took his seat, surrounded by twenty thousand saints upon the Buddha’s goodly seat, which was appointed for him.*";
P_HTM[1974]="***Now the Sākiyas are a proud and stiff-necked race; and they, thinking within themselves: “Prince Siddhattha is younger than we; he is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson,” said to the younger princes, “You do him obeisance; we will sit behind you.” As they sat there without doing obeisance to him, the Fortunate One, perceiving their intent, thought to himself, “My kinsfolk do me no obeisance; well, I will make them do so.” So he caused to arise in him that Absorption which is based on the Super Knowledges, rose up into the air, and as though shaking off the dust of his feet upon their heads, performed a miracle like the twofold miracle at the foot of the knot-mango tree. The king, seeing this wonder, said: “Sir, on the day of your birth, when I saw your feet placed upon the head of brahmin Kāladevala who had come to do you obeisance, I did obeisance to you, and that was the first time. On the day of the Plowing Festival, when you sat on the royal seat under the shade of a Jambu plum tree, when I saw that the shadow of the tree moved not, I did obeisance to your feet; and that was the second time. And now again, I see a miracle which I never saw before, and do obeisance to your feet, this is the third time.” But when the king had thus done obeisance, not one Sākiya could sit still and refrain, they did obeisance one and all.*";
P_HTM[1975]="***The Fortunate One, having thus made his kinsfolk do obeisance to him, came down from the air and sat upon the appointed seat; when the Fortunate One was there seated, his kinsfolk were made wise, and sat with peace in their hearts. Then a great cloud arose, and burst into a shower of rain: down came the rain red and with a loud noise, and those who desired to be wet were wetted, but he who did not, had not even a drop fell upon his body. All who saw it were astonished at the miracle, and cried one to another, “Lo, a marvel! Lo, a miracle! Lo, the power of the Buddhas, on whose kinsfolk such a shower of rain is falling!” On hearing this, the Buddha said: “This is not the first time, monks, that a great shower of rain has fallen upon my kinsfolk,” and then, at their request, he told a story of the past.*";
P_HTM[1976]="***The Ten Boons*";
P_HTM[1977]="***In the past, a king named Sivi, reigning in the city of Jetuttara in the kingdom of Sivi, had a son named Sañjaya. When the lad came of age, the king brought him a princess named Phusatī, daughter of king Madda, and handed over the kingdom to him, making Phusatī his queen consort. Her former connection with the world was as follows.*";
P_HTM[1978]="***In the ninety-first age from this, a Teacher arose in the world named Vipassī. While he was dwelling in the deer-park of Khema, near the city of Bandhumatī, a certain king sent to king Bandhuma a golden wreath worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, with precious sandalwood. Now the king had two daughters; and being desirous to give this present to them, he gave the sandalwood to the elder and the golden wreath to the younger. But both declined to use these gifts for themselves; and with the intent to offer them in respect to the Teacher, they said to the king, “Father, we will offer to the One with Ten Powers this sandalwood and this golden wreath.” To this the king gave his consent. So the elder princess powdered the sandalwood, and filled with the powder a golden box; and the younger sister caused the golden wreath to be made into a golden necklet, and laid it in a golden box. Then they both proceeded to the hermitage in the deer-park; and the elder sister, reverently sprinkling the One with Ten Powers’ golden body with the sandalwood powder, scattered the rest in his cell, and said this prayer, “Sir, in time to come, may I be the mother of a Buddha like you.” The younger reverently placed upon the Tathāgata’s golden body the gold-lace necklet which had been made out of the golden wreath, and prayed, “Sir, until I become an Arahat, may this ornament never part from my body.” And the Teacher granted their prayers.*";
P_HTM[1979]="***Both these, after their life was over, came into being in the world of gods. The elder sister, passing from the world of gods to the world of men and back again, at the end of the ninety-first age became queen Māyā mother of the Buddha. The younger sister passing to and fro in like manner, in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, became the daughter of king Kiki; and being born with the semblance of a necklace upon her neck and shoulders, beautiful as though drawn by a painter, she was named Uracchadā [Necklace]. When she was a girl of sixteen years, she heard a pious utterance of the Teacher, and attained to the fruit of the First Path, and so the very same day she became an Arahat, and then entered the Saṅgha, and attained Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[1980]="***Now king Kiki had seven other daughters, whose names were:*";
P_HTM[1981]="***Samaṇī, Samaṇā, the holy sister Guttā,*";
P_HTM[1982]="***Bhikkhudāsikā, and Dhammā and Sudhammā,*";
P_HTM[1983]="***And of the sisters the seventh Saṅghadāsī.*";
P_HTM[1984]="***In this manifestation of the Buddha, these sisters were:*";
P_HTM[1985]="***Khemā, Uppalavaṇṇā, the third was Paṭācārā,*";
P_HTM[1986]="***Gotamā, Dhammadinnā, and sixthly Mahāmāyā,*";
P_HTM[1987]="***And of this band of sisters the seventh was Visākhā.*";
P_HTM[1988]="***Now of these Phusatī became Sudhammā; who did good deeds and gave alms, and by fruit of the offering of sandalwood done to Buddha Vipassī, had her body as it were sprinkled with choice sandalwood. Then passing to and fro between the worlds of men and of gods, eventually she became chief queen of Sakka, King of the Devas. After her days there were done, and the five customary signs were to be seen, Sakka, King of the Devas, realizing that her time was exhausted, escorted her with great glory to the pleasure gardens in Nandana grove; then as she reclined on a richly adorned seat, he, sitting beside it, said to her, “Dear Phusatī, ten boons I grant you: choose.” With these words, he uttered the first verse in this Great Vessantarajātaka [Ja 547] with its thousand verses:*";
P_HTM[1989]="***1. “Ten boons I give you, Phusatī, O beauteous lady bright:*";
P_HTM[1990]="***Choose you whatever on the earth is precious in your sight.”*";
P_HTM[1991]="***Thus she came to be established in the world of gods by the preaching in the Great Vessantara.*";
P_HTM[1992]="***But she, not knowing the circumstances of her rebirth, felt faint, and said the second verse:*";
P_HTM[1993]="***2. “Glory to you, O king of gods! What wrong is done by me,*";
P_HTM[1994]="***To send me from this lovely place as winds blow down a tree?”*";
P_HTM[1995]="***And Sakka perceiving her despondency uttered two verses:*";
P_HTM[1996]="***3. “Dear are you still as you have been, and wrong you have not done:*";
P_HTM[1997]="***I speak because your merit now is all used up and gone.*";
P_HTM[1998]="***4. Now your departure is at hand, the hour of death draws nigh:*";
P_HTM[1999]="***Ten boons I offer you to choose; then choose, before you die.”*";
P_HTM[2000]="***Hearing these words of Sakka, and convinced that she must die, she said, choosing the boons:*";
P_HTM[2001]="***5. “King Sakka, lord of beings all, a boon hath granted me:*";
P_HTM[2002]="***I bless him: craving that my life in Sivi’s realm may be.*";
P_HTM[2003]="***6. Black eyes, black pupils like a fawn, black eyebrows may I have,*";
P_HTM[2004]="***And Phusatī my name: this boon, O bounteous one, I crave.*";
P_HTM[2005]="***7. A son be mine, revered by kings, famed, glorious, debonair,*";
P_HTM[2006]="***Bounteous, ungrudging, one to lend a ready ear to prayer.*";
P_HTM[2007]="***8. And while the babe is in my womb let not my figure go,*";
P_HTM[2008]="***Let it be slim and graceful like a finely fashioned bow.*";
P_HTM[2009]="***9. Still, Sakka, may my breasts be firm, nor white-haired may I be;*";
P_HTM[2010]="***My body all unblemished, may I set the death-doomed free.*";
P_HTM[2011]="***10. Mid herons’ cries, and peacocks’ calls, with waiting women fair,*";
P_HTM[2012]="***Poets and bards to sing our praise, shawls waving in the air,*";
P_HTM[2013]="***11. When rattling on the painted door the menial calls aloud,*";
P_HTM[2014]="***God bless king Sivi! Come to meat! Be I his queen avowed.”*";
P_HTM[2015]="***Sakka said:*";
P_HTM[2016]="***12. “Know that these boons, my lady bright, which I have granted you,*";
P_HTM[2017]="***In Sivi kingdom, beauteous one, all ten fulfilled shall be.*";
P_HTM[2018]="***13. So spake the monarch of the gods, the great Sujampati,*";
P_HTM[2019]="***Called Vāsava, well pleased to grant a boon to Phusatī.”*";
P_HTM[2020]="***The Himālayas*";
P_HTM[2021]="***When she had thus chosen her boons, she left that world, and was conceived in the womb of king Madda’s queen; and when she was born, because her body was as it were sprinkled with the perfume of sandalwood, on her name-day they called her by the name Phusatī [Sprinkled]. She grew up amidst a great company of attendants until in her sixteenth year she surpassed all others in beauty.*";
P_HTM[2022]="***At that time prince Sañjaya, son of the king of Sivi, was to be invested with the white umbrella; the princess was sent for to be his bride, and she was made queen consort at the head of sixteen thousand women; wherefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[2023]="***14. “Next born a princess, Phusatī was to the city led,*";
P_HTM[2024]="***Jetuttara, and there anon to Sañjaya was wed.”*";
P_HTM[2025]="***Sañjaya loved her dearly. Now Sakka pondering remembered how that nine of his ten boons given to Phusatī were fulfilled. “But one is left unfulfilled,” he thought, “a goodly son; this I will fulfil for her.” At that time the Great Being was in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and his time was done; perceiving which Sakka approached him, and said: “Venerable sir, you must enter the world of men; without delay you must be conceived in the womb of Phusatī, queen consort of the king of Sivi.”*";
P_HTM[2026]="***With these words, asking the consent of the Great Being and the sixty thousand Devaputtas who were destined to rebirth, he went to his own place. The Great Being came down and was reborn there, and the sixty thousand Devaputtas were born in the families of sixty thousand courtiers. Phusatī, when the Great Being was conceived in her womb, finding herself with child, desired six alms halls to be built, one at each of the four gates, one in the middle of the city, and one at her own door; that each day she might distribute six hundred thousand pieces. The king, learning how it was with her, consulted the fortune-tellers, who said: “Great king, in your wife’s womb is conceived a being devoted to generosity, who will never be satisfied with giving.” Hearing this he was pleased, and made a practice of giving as before said.*";
P_HTM[2027]="***From the time of the Bodhisatta’s conception, there was no end one might say to the king’s revenue; by the influence of the king’s goodness, the kings of all Jambudīpa sent him presents.*";
P_HTM[2028]="***Now the queen while with child remained with her large company of attendants, until ten months were fulfilled, and then she wished to visit the city. She informed the king, who caused the city to be decorated like to a city of the gods: he set his queen in a noble chariot, and made procession about the city rightwise. When they had reached the midst of the Vessa quarter, the pains of travail seized upon her. They told the king, and then and there he caused a lying-in chamber to be made and made her go there; and then she brought forth a son; wherefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[2029]="***15. “Ten months she bore me in her womb; procession then they made;*";
P_HTM[2030]="***And Phusatī in Vessa Street through me was brought to bed.”*";
P_HTM[2031]="***The Great Being came from his mother’s womb free from impurity, open-eyed, and on the instant holding out his hand to his mother, he said: “Mother, I wish to make some gift; is there anything?” She replied, “Yes, my son, give as you will,” and dropped a purse of a thousand pieces into the outstretched hand. Three times the Great Being spoke as soon as born: in the Ummaggajātaka [Ja 546], in this Jātaka [Ja 547], and in his last birth. On his name-day, because he was born in the Vessa Street, they gave him the name Vessantara; wherefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[2032]="***16. “My name not from the mother’s side nor from the father’s came;*";
P_HTM[2033]="***As I was born in Vessa Street, Vessantara’s my name.”*";
P_HTM[2034]="***On his very birthday, a female flying elephant brought a young one, esteemed to be of lucky omen, white all over, and left it in the royal stables. Because this creature came to supply a need of the Great Being, they named it Paccaya [Support]. The king appointed four times sixty nurses for the Great Being, neither too tall nor too short, and free from all other fault, with sweet milk; he appointed also nurses for the sixty thousand children born with him, and so he grew up surrounded by this great company of sixty thousand children. The king caused to be made a prince’s necklace with a hundred thousand pieces of money, and gave it to his son; but he, being of four or five years of age, gave it away to his nurses, nor would he take it back when they wished to give it. They told this to the king, who said: “What my son has given is well given; be it a brahmin’s gift,” and had another necklace made. But the prince still in his childhood gave this also to his nurses, and so nine times over.*";
P_HTM[2035]="***When he was eight years old, as he reclined on his couch, the boy thought to himself, “All that I give comes from without, and this does not satisfy me; I wish to give something of my very own. If one should ask my heart, I would cut open my breast, and tear it out, and give it; if one ask my eyes, I would pluck out my eyes and give them; if one should ask my flesh, I would cut off all the flesh of my body and give it.” And thus he pondered with all his being and the depths of his heart; this earth, forty thousand quadrillions of leagues in extent, and two hundred thousands of leagues in depth, quaked thundering like a great mad elephant; Sineru chief of mountains bowed like a sapling in hot steam, and seemed to dance, and stood leaning towards the city of Jetuttara; at the earth’s rumbling the sky thundered with lightning and rain; forked lightning flashed; the ocean was stirred up: Sakka, King of the Devas, clapped his arms, Mahābrahmā gave a sign of approval, high as Brahmā’s Realm all was in uproar; wherefore it is said also:*";
P_HTM[2036]="***17. “When I was yet a little boy, but of the age of eight,*";
P_HTM[2037]="***Upon my terrace, generosity and gifts I meditate.*";
P_HTM[2038]="***18. If any man should ask of me blood, body, heart, or eye,*";
P_HTM[2039]="***Or blood or body, eye or heart I’d give him, was my cry.*";
P_HTM[2040]="***19. And as with all my being I pondered with thoughts like these*";
P_HTM[2041]="***The unshaken earth did shake and quake with mountains, woods and trees.” By the age of sixteen, the Bodhisatta had attained a mastery of all sciences. Then his father, desiring to make him king, consulted with his mother; from the family of king Madda they brought his first cousin, named Maddī, with sixteen thousand attendant women, and made her his queen consort, and sprinkled him with the water of coronation. From the time of his receiving the kingdom he distributed much alms, giving each day six hundred thousand pieces of money.*";
P_HTM[2042]="***By and by queen Maddī brought forth a son, and they laid him in a golden hammock, for which reason they gave him the name of prince Jāli [Net]. By the time he could go on foot the queen bore a daughter, and they laid her in a black skin, for which reason they gave her the name of Kaṇhājinā [Black Skin]. Each month the Great Being would visit his six alms halls six times, mounted upon his magnificent elephant.*";
P_HTM[2043]="***Now at that time there was drought in the kingdom of Kāliṅga: the corn grew not, there was a great famine, and men being unable to live resorted to robbery. Tormented by want, the people gathered in the king’s courtyard and upbraided him. Hearing this the king said: “What is it, my children?” They told him. He replied, “Good, my children, I will bring the rain,” and dismissed them. He pledged himself to virtue, and kept the Uposatha vow, but he could not make the rain come; so he summoned the citizens together, and said to them, “I pledged myself to virtue, and seven days I kept the Uposatha vow, yet I could not make the rain come: what is to be done now?” They replied, “If you cannot bring the rain, my lord, Vessantara in the city of Jetuttara, king Sañjaya’s son, is devoted to generosity; he has a glorious elephant all white, and wherever he goes the rain falls; send brahmins, and ask for that elephant, and bring him here.” The king agreed; and assembling the brahmins he chose out eight of them, gave them provisions for their journey, and said to them, “Go and fetch Vessantara’s elephant.”*";
P_HTM[2044]="***On this mission, the brahmins proceeded in due course to Jetuttara city; in the alms-hall they received entertainment; sprinkled their bodies with dust and smeared them with mud; and on the day of the full moon, to ask for the king’s elephant, they went to the eastern gate at the time the king came to the alms-hall. Early in the morning, the king, intending a visit to the alms-hall, washed himself with sixteen pitchers of perfumed water, and broke his fast, and mounted upon the back of his noble elephant richly adorned proceeded to the eastern gate. The brahmins found no opportunity there, and went to the southern gate, standing upon a mound and watched the king giving alms at the eastern gate. When he came to the southern gate, stretching out their hands they cried, “Victory to the noble Vessantara!” The Great Being, as he saw the brahmins, drove the elephant to the place whereon they stood, and seated upon its back uttered the first verse: 20. “With hairy armpits, hairy heads, stained teeth, and dust on poll,*";
P_HTM[2045]="***O brahmins, stretching forth your hands, what is it that you crave?”*";
P_HTM[2046]="***To this the brahmins replied:*";
P_HTM[2047]="***21. “We crave a precious thing, O prince that do your people save:*";
P_HTM[2048]="***That choice and saving elephant with tusks like any pole.”*";
P_HTM[2049]="***When the Great Being heard this, he thought: “I am willing to give anything that is my own, from my head onwards, and what they ask is something outside me; I will fulfil their wish,” and from the elephant’s back, he replied:*";
P_HTM[2050]="***22. “I give, and never shrink from it, that which the brahmins want,*";
P_HTM[2051]="***This noble beast, for riding fit, fierce tuskèd elephant,”*";
P_HTM[2052]="***and thus consenting:*";
P_HTM[2053]="***23. “The king, the saviour of his folk, dismounted from its back,*";
P_HTM[2054]="***And glad in sacrificing, gave the brahmins what they lacked.”*";
P_HTM[2055]="***The ornaments on the elephant’s four feet were worth four hundred thousand, those on his two sides were worth two hundred thousand, the blanket under his belly a hundred thousand, on his back were nets of pearls, of gold, and of jewels, three nets worth three hundred thousand, in the two ears two hundred thousand, on his back a rug worth a hundred thousand, the ornament on the frontal globes worth a hundred thousand, three wrappings three hundred thousand, the small ear-ornaments two hundred thousand, those on the two tusks two hundred thousand, the ornament for luck on his trunk a hundred thousand, that on his tail a hundred thousand, not to mention the priceless ornaments on his body two and twenty hundred thousand, a ladder to mount, by one hundred thousand, the food-vessel a hundred thousand, which comes to as much as four and twenty hundred thousand: moreover the jewels great and small upon the canopy, the jewels in his necklace of pearls, the jewels in the goad, the jewels in the pearl necklace about his neck, the jewels on his frontal globes, all these without price, the elephant also without price, making with the elephant seven priceless things – all these he gave to the brahmins; besides five hundred attendants with the grooms and stablemen: and with that gift the earthquake came to pass, and the other portents as related above.*";
P_HTM[2056]="***To explain this, the Teacher spoke:*";
P_HTM[2057]="***24. “Then was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;*";
P_HTM[2058]="***When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.*";
P_HTM[2059]="***25. Then was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;*";
P_HTM[2060]="***When the great elephant was given, trembled the town for fear.*";
P_HTM[2061]="***26. With a resounding mighty roar the city all did ring,*";
P_HTM[2062]="***When the great elephant was given by Sivi’s foster-king.” The city of Jetuttara all did tremble. The brahmins, we are told, at the southern gate received the elephant, mounted upon his back, and amidst a thronging multitude passed through the midst of the city. The crowd, beholding them, cried out, “O brahmins, mounted upon our elephant, why are you taking our elephant?” The brahmins replied, “The great king Vessantara has given the elephant to us: who are you?” and so with contemptuous gestures to the crowd, through the city they passed and out by the northern gate by aid of the deities. The people of the city, angry with the Bodhisatta, uttered loud reproaches.*";
P_HTM[2063]="***To explain this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2064]="***27. “Upon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,*";
P_HTM[2065]="***When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.*";
P_HTM[2066]="***28. Upon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,*";
P_HTM[2067]="***When the great elephant was given trembled the town to hear.*";
P_HTM[2068]="***29. So loud and mighty was the sound all terrible did ring,*";
P_HTM[2069]="***When the great elephant was given by Sivi’s foster-king.”*";
P_HTM[2070]="***The citizens, trembling at heart for this gift, addressed themselves to the king. Therefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[2071]="***30. “Then prince and brahmin, Vesiya and Ugga, great and small,*";
P_HTM[2072]="***Mahouts and footmen, charioteers and soldiers, one and all,*";
P_HTM[2073]="***31. The country landowners, and all the Sivi folk come by.*";
P_HTM[2074]="***Seeing the elephant depart, thus to the king did cry:*";
P_HTM[2075]="***32. ‘Your realm is ruined, sire: why should Vessantara your son*";
P_HTM[2076]="***Thus give away our elephant revered by every one?*";
P_HTM[2077]="***33. Why give our saviour elephant, pole-tuskèd, goodly, white,*";
P_HTM[2078]="***Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight?*";
P_HTM[2079]="***34. With jewels and his yak-tail fan; which trampled down all foes;*";
P_HTM[2080]="***Long-tuskèd, furious, white as Mount Kelāsa with his snows;*";
P_HTM[2081]="***35. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,*";
P_HTM[2082]="***With leech and driver, he has given away this precious thing.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2083]="***After saying this, they said again:*";
P_HTM[2084]="***36. “Whoso bestows with food and drink, with raiment, fire and fleet,*";
P_HTM[2085]="***That is a right and proper gift, for brahmins that is meet.*";
P_HTM[2086]="***37. O Sañjaya, your people’s friend, say why this thing was done*";
P_HTM[2087]="***By him, a prince of our own line, Vessantara, your son?*";
P_HTM[2088]="***38. The bidding of the Sivi folk if you refuse to do,*";
P_HTM[2089]="***The people then will act, I think, against your son and you.”*";
P_HTM[2090]="***Hearing this, the king suspected that they wished to slay Vessantara; and he said:*";
P_HTM[2091]="***39. “Yea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,*";
P_HTM[2092]="***Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,*";
P_HTM[2093]="***Nor will obey the people’s voice: my true-born son is he.*";
P_HTM[2094]="***40. Yea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,*";
P_HTM[2095]="***Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,*";
P_HTM[2096]="***Nor will obey the people’s voice: my very son is he.*";
P_HTM[2097]="***41. No, I will work no harm on him; all noble is he still;*";
P_HTM[2098]="***And it would be a shame for me, and it would cause much ill.*";
P_HTM[2099]="***Vessantara, my very son, with sword how could I kill?”*";
P_HTM[2100]="***The people of Sivi replied:*";
P_HTM[2101]="***42. “Not chastisement does he deserve, nor sword, nor prison cell,*";
P_HTM[2102]="***But from the kingdom banish him, on Vaṅka’s mount to dwell.”*";
P_HTM[2103]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[2104]="***43. “Behold the people’s will! And I that will do not gainsay.*";
P_HTM[2105]="***But let him bide one happy night before he go away.*";
P_HTM[2106]="***44. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,*";
P_HTM[2107]="***Together let the people come and banish him away.”*";
P_HTM[2108]="***They agreed to the king’s proposal for just the one night. Then he let them go away, and thinking to send a message to his son, he commissioned an agent, who accordingly went to Vessantara’s house and told him what had befallen.*";
P_HTM[2109]="***To make this clear, the following verses were said:*";
P_HTM[2110]="***45. “Rise, fellow, go away post-haste, and tell the prince my word.*";
P_HTM[2111]="***The people all, and citizens, in wrath, with one accord,*";
P_HTM[2112]="***46. Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins too, my son,*";
P_HTM[2113]="***Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, and footmen, every one,*";
P_HTM[2114]="***All citizens, all country folk, together here have run,*";
P_HTM[2115]="***47. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,*";
P_HTM[2116]="***They will assemble one and all and banish you away.*";
P_HTM[2117]="***48. This fellow sent by Sivi’s king swift on his errand pressed,*";
P_HTM[2118]="***Upon an armed elephant, perfumed, and finely dressed,*";
P_HTM[2119]="***49. Head bathed in water, jewelled rings in ears, and on he rode*";
P_HTM[2120]="***Till to that lovely town he came, Vessantara’s abode.*";
P_HTM[2121]="***50. Then he beheld the happy prince abiding in his land,*";
P_HTM[2122]="***Like Vāsava the king of gods; round him the courtiers stand.*";
P_HTM[2123]="***51. There in haste the fellow went, and to the prince said he:*";
P_HTM[2124]="***‘I bear ill tidings, royal sir: be not angry with me!’*";
P_HTM[2125]="***52. With due obeisance, weeping sore, he said unto the king:*";
P_HTM[2126]="***‘You are my master, sire, and you do give me every thing:*";
P_HTM[2127]="***Bad news I have to tell you now: do you some comfort bring.*";
P_HTM[2128]="***53. The people all and citizens, in wrath, with one consent,*";
P_HTM[2129]="***Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins, all are bent,*";
P_HTM[2130]="***54. Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, the footmen every one,*";
P_HTM[2131]="***All citizens and country folk together now have run,*";
P_HTM[2132]="***55. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,*";
P_HTM[2133]="***Determined all to come in crowds and banish you away.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2134]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[2135]="***56. “Why are people angry with me? For no offence I see.*";
P_HTM[2136]="***Tell me, good fellow, wherefore pray they wish to banish me?”*";
P_HTM[2137]="***The agent said:*";
P_HTM[2138]="***57. “Uggas and vesiyas, charioteers, and brahmins every one,*";
P_HTM[2139]="***Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers and footmen, there run,*";
P_HTM[2140]="***All angry at your giving gifts, and therefore banish you.”*";
P_HTM[2141]="***Hearing this, the Great Being, in all content, said:*";
P_HTM[2142]="***58. “My very eye and heart I’d give: why not what is not mine,*";
P_HTM[2143]="***Or gold or treasure, precious stones, or pearls, or jewels fine?*";
P_HTM[2144]="***59. Comes any one to ask of me, I’d give my hand, my right,*";
P_HTM[2145]="***Nor for a moment hesitate: in gifts is my delight.*";
P_HTM[2146]="***60. Now let the people banish me, now let the people kill,*";
P_HTM[2147]="***Or cut me sevenfold, for cease from gifts I never will.”*";
P_HTM[2148]="***On hearing this, the agent again spoke, no message of the king’s or of the people’s, but another command out of his own mind:*";
P_HTM[2149]="***61. “This is the Sivi people’s will; they bade me tell you so:*";
P_HTM[2150]="***Where Kontimārā by the hill Ārañjara does flow,*";
P_HTM[2151]="***There depart, where banished men, good sir, are wont to go.”*";
P_HTM[2152]="***This he said, we are told, by inspiration of a deity.*";
P_HTM[2153]="***Hearing this, the Bodhisatta replied, “Very well, I shall go by the road that those go who have offended; but me the citizens do not banish for any offence, they banish me for the gift of the elephant. In this case I wish to give the great gift of the seven hundreds, and I pray the citizens to grant me one day’s delay for that. Tomorrow I will make my gift, the next day I will go.”*";
P_HTM[2154]="***62. “So I by that same road shall go as they who do offend:*";
P_HTM[2155]="***But first to make a gift, one night and day I pray them lend.”*";
P_HTM[2156]="***“Very good,” said the agent, “I will report this to the citizens,” and away he went.*";
P_HTM[2157]="***The man gone, the Great Being summoning one of his captains said to him, “Tomorrow I am to make the gift called the gift of the seven hundreds. You must get ready seven hundred elephants, with the same number of horses, chariots, girls, cows, men slaves and women slaves, and provide every kind of food and drink, even the strong liquor, everything which is fit to give.” So having arranged for the great gift of the seven hundreds, he dismissed his courtiers, and alone departed to the dwelling of Maddī; where seating himself on the royal couch, he began to address her.*";
P_HTM[2158]="***The Teacher thus described it:*";
P_HTM[2159]="***63. “Thus did the king to Maddī speak, that lady passing fair:*";
P_HTM[2160]="***‘All that I ever gave to you, or goods or grain, beware,*";
P_HTM[2161]="***64. Or gold or treasure, precious stones, and plenty more beside,*";
P_HTM[2162]="***Your father’s dower, find a place this treasure all to hide.*";
P_HTM[2163]="***65. Then out spake Maddī to the king, that princess passing fair:*";
P_HTM[2164]="***Where shall I find a place, my lord, to hide it? Tell me where?’ ”*";
P_HTM[2165]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[2166]="***66. “In due proportion on the good your wealth in gifts bestow,*";
P_HTM[2167]="***No other place than this is safe to keep it, well I know.”*";
P_HTM[2168]="***She consented, and withal he exhorted her in this wise:*";
P_HTM[2169]="***67. “Be kind, O Maddī, to your sons, your husband’s parents both,*";
P_HTM[2170]="***To him who will your husband be do service, nothing loth.*";
P_HTM[2171]="***68. And if no man should wish to be your husband, when I’m gone,*";
P_HTM[2172]="***Go seek a husband for thyself, but do not pine alone.”*";
P_HTM[2173]="***Then Maddī thought: “Why I wonder does Vessantara say such a thing to me?” And she asked him, “My lord, why do you say to me what you ought not to say?” The Great Being replied, “Lady, the people of Sivi, angry with me for the gift of the elephant, are banishing me from the realm: tomorrow I am to make the gift of the seven hundreds, and next day I depart from the city.” And he said:*";
P_HTM[2174]="***69. “Tomorrow to a forest drear, beset with beasts of prey,*";
P_HTM[2175]="***I go: and whether I can live within it, who can say?”*";
P_HTM[2176]="***70. Then spake the princess Maddī, spake the lady passing fair:*";
P_HTM[2177]="***“It is not so! A wicked word! To say it do not dare!*";
P_HTM[2178]="***71. It is not meet and right, my king, that you alone should fare:*";
P_HTM[2179]="***Whatever journey you shall go, I also will be there.*";
P_HTM[2180]="***72. Give me the choice to die with you, or live from you apart,*";
P_HTM[2181]="***Death is my choice, unless I can live with you where you art.*";
P_HTM[2182]="***73. Kindle a blazing fiery flame the fiercest that can be,*";
P_HTM[2183]="***There I would rather die the death than live apart from thee.*";
P_HTM[2184]="***74. As close behind an elephant his mate is often found*";
P_HTM[2185]="***Moving through mountain pass or wood, o’er rough or level ground,*";
P_HTM[2186]="***75. So with my boys I’ll follow you, wherever you may lead,*";
P_HTM[2187]="***Nor shall you find me burdensome or difficult to feed.”*";
P_HTM[2188]="***With these words she began to praise the region of the Himālayas as if she had seen it:*";
P_HTM[2189]="***76. “When you shall see your pretty boys, and hear their prattle ring*";

P_HTM[2249]="***103. Belovèd by the king and queen, by all his kith and kin,*";
P_HTM[2250]="***Belovèd by his friends, the realm and all that are therein,*";
P_HTM[2251]="***Why banish they Vessantara, my unoffending son?”*";
P_HTM[2252]="***After this bitter lament, she consoled her son and his wife, and went before the king and said:*";
P_HTM[2253]="***104. “Like mangoes fallen to the ground, like money waste and spent,*";
P_HTM[2254]="***So falls your kingdom, if they will banish the innocent.*";
P_HTM[2255]="***105. Like a wild goose with crippled wing, when all the water’s gone,*";
P_HTM[2256]="***Deserted by your courtiers, you will live in pain alone.*";
P_HTM[2257]="***106. I tell you true, O mighty king: let not your good go by,*";
P_HTM[2258]="***Nor banish him, the innocent, because the people cry.”*";
P_HTM[2259]="***Hearing which, the king answered:*";
P_HTM[2260]="***107. “Your son, the people’s banner, if I send to exile drear,*";
P_HTM[2261]="***My royal duty I obey, than life itself more dear.”*";
P_HTM[2262]="***On hearing this, the queen said, lamenting:*";
P_HTM[2263]="***108-111. “Once hosts of men escorted him, with goodly banners flown,*";
P_HTM[2264]="***Like forests full of flowering trees: today he goes alone.*";
P_HTM[2265]="***112. Bright yellow robes, Gandhāra make, once round about him shone,*";
P_HTM[2266]="***Or glowing scarlet, as he went: today he goes alone.*";
P_HTM[2267]="***113. With chariot, litter, elephant he went in former days:*";
P_HTM[2268]="***Today the king Vessantara afoot must tramp the ways.*";
P_HTM[2269]="***114. He once by sandal-scent perfumed, awaked by dance and song,*";
P_HTM[2270]="***How wear rough skins, how axe and pot and pingo bear along?*";
P_HTM[2271]="***115. Why will they not bring yellow robes, why not the garb of skin,*";
P_HTM[2272]="***And dress of bark, the mighty woods that he may enter in?*";
P_HTM[2273]="***116. How can a banished king put on the robe of bark to wear,*";
P_HTM[2274]="***To dress in bark and grass how will the princess Maddī bear?*";
P_HTM[2275]="***117. Maddī, who once Benares cloth and linen used to wear,*";
P_HTM[2276]="***And fine kodumbara, how bark and grasses will she bear?*";
P_HTM[2277]="***118. She who in litter or in car was carried to and fro,*";
P_HTM[2278]="***The lovely princess, now today on foot how can she go?*";
P_HTM[2279]="***119. With tender hands and tender feet in happiness she stood:*";
P_HTM[2280]="***How can the lovely princess go trembling into the wood?*";
P_HTM[2281]="***120. With tender hands and tender feet she lived in happy state:*";
P_HTM[2282]="***The finest slippers she could wear would hurt her feet of late;*";
P_HTM[2283]="***Today how can the lovely one afoot now go her gait?*";
P_HTM[2284]="***121. Once she would go with garlands amidst a thousand maids:*";
P_HTM[2285]="***How can the beauteous one alone now walk the forest glades?*";
P_HTM[2286]="***122. Once if she heard the jackal howl she would be all dismayed:*";
P_HTM[2287]="***How can the timid beauteous one now walk the forest glade?*";
P_HTM[2288]="***123. She who of Sakka’s royal race would ever shrink afraid,*";
P_HTM[2289]="***Trembling like one possessed, to hear the hoot some owl had made,*";
P_HTM[2290]="***How can the timid beauteous one now walk the forest glade?*";
P_HTM[2291]="***124. Like as a bird beholds the nest empty, the brood all slain,*";
P_HTM[2292]="***So when I see the empty place long shall I burn in pain.*";
P_HTM[2293]="***125. Like to a bird that sees the nest empty, the brood all slain,*";
P_HTM[2294]="***Thin, yellow I shall grow to see my dear son ne’er again.*";
P_HTM[2295]="***126. Like to a bird that sees the nest empty, the brood all slain,*";
P_HTM[2296]="***I’ll run distracted, if I see my dear son ne’er again.*";
P_HTM[2297]="***127. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,*";
P_HTM[2298]="***So when I see the empty place long shall I live in pain.*";
P_HTM[2299]="***128. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,*";
P_HTM[2300]="***Thin, yellow I shall grow to see my dear son ne’er again.*";
P_HTM[2301]="***129. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,*";
P_HTM[2302]="***I’ll run distracted, if I see my dear son ne’er again.*";
P_HTM[2303]="***130. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the water’s gone,*";
P_HTM[2304]="***Long shall I live in pain, to see no more my dearest son.*";
P_HTM[2305]="***131. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the water’s gone,*";
P_HTM[2306]="***Thin, yellow I shall grow to see no more my dearest son.*";
P_HTM[2307]="***132. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the water’s gone,*";
P_HTM[2308]="***I’ll fly distracted, if I see no more my dearest son.*";
P_HTM[2309]="***133. And if you banish from the realm my unoffending son,*";
P_HTM[2310]="***In spite of this my sore complaint, I think my life is done.”*";
P_HTM[2311]="***Explaining this matter, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2312]="***134. “Hearing the queen bewailing sore, straight all together went*";
P_HTM[2313]="***The palace dames, their arms outstretched, to join in her lament.*";
P_HTM[2314]="***135. And in the palace of the prince, prone lying all around*";
P_HTM[2315]="***Women and children lay like trees blown down upon the ground.*";
P_HTM[2316]="***136. And when the night was at an end, and the sun rose next day,*";
P_HTM[2317]="***Then king Vessantara began his gifts to give away.*";
P_HTM[2318]="***137. ‘Food to the hungry give, strong drink to those who drink require,*";
P_HTM[2319]="***Give clothes to those who wish for clothes, each after his desire.*";
P_HTM[2320]="***138. Let not one suitor hither come go disappointed back,*";
P_HTM[2321]="***Show all respect, and food or drink to taste let no man lack.’*";
P_HTM[2322]="***139. And so they gathered thick and fast with joy and merry play,*";
P_HTM[2323]="***As Sivi’s great and fostering king prepared to go away.*";
P_HTM[2324]="***140. They did cut down a mighty tree that full of fruit did stand,*";
P_HTM[2325]="***When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.*";
P_HTM[2326]="***141. They did cut down a wishing tree, with every boon at hand,*";
P_HTM[2327]="***When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.*";
P_HTM[2328]="***142. They did cut down a wishing tree, with choicest boons at hand,*";
P_HTM[2329]="***When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.*";
P_HTM[2330]="***143. Both old and young, and all between, did weep and wail that day,*";
P_HTM[2331]="***Stretching their arms out, when the king prepared to go away,*";
P_HTM[2332]="***Who fostered Sivi’s realm.*";
P_HTM[2333]="***144. Wise women, eunuchs, the king’s wives, did weep and wail that day,*";
P_HTM[2334]="***Stretching their arms out, when the king prepared to go away,*";
P_HTM[2335]="***Who fostered Sivi’s realm.*";
P_HTM[2336]="***145. And all the women in the town did weep and wail that day,*";
P_HTM[2337]="***When Sivi’s great and fostering king prepared to go away.*";
P_HTM[2338]="***146. The brahmins and ascetics too, and all who begged for need,*";
P_HTM[2339]="***Stretching their arms out, cried aloud, ‘It is a wicked deed!’*";
P_HTM[2340]="***147. To all the city while the king his bounty did present,*";
P_HTM[2341]="***And by the people’s sentence, fared forth into banishment.*";
P_HTM[2342]="***148. Seven hundred elephants he gave, with splendour all bedight,*";
P_HTM[2343]="***With girths of gold, caparisoned with trappings golden bright,*";
P_HTM[2344]="***149. Each ridden by his own mahout, with spikèd hook in hand:*";
P_HTM[2345]="***Lo now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2346]="***150. Seven hundred horses too he gave, bedecked in bright array,*";
P_HTM[2347]="***Horses of Sindh, and thoroughbreds, all fleet of foot are they,*";
P_HTM[2348]="***151. Each ridden by a henchman bold, with sword and bow in hand:*";
P_HTM[2349]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2350]="***152. Seven hundred chariots all yoked, with banners flying free,*";
P_HTM[2351]="***With tiger skin and panther hide, a gorgeous sight to see,*";
P_HTM[2352]="***153. Each driven by mailèd charioteers, all armed with bow in hand:*";
P_HTM[2353]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2354]="***154. Seven hundred women too he gave, each standing in a car,*";
P_HTM[2355]="***With golden chains and ornaments bedecked these women are,*";
P_HTM[2356]="***155. With lovely dress and ornaments, with slender waist and small,*";
P_HTM[2357]="***Curved brows, a merry smile and bright, and shapely hips withal:*";
P_HTM[2358]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2359]="***156. Seven hundred kine he also gave, with silver milkpails all:*";
P_HTM[2360]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2361]="***157. Seven hundred female slaves he gave, as many men at call:*";
P_HTM[2362]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2363]="***158-159. Cars, horses, women, elephants he gave, yet after all,*";
P_HTM[2364]="***Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!*";
P_HTM[2365]="***160. That was a thing most terrible, that made the hair to stand,*";
P_HTM[2366]="***When now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!”*";
P_HTM[2367]="***Now a deity told the news to the kings of all Jambudīpa: how Vessantara was giving great gifts of high-born maidens and the like. Therefore the Khattiyas by the divine power came in a chariot, and returned with the high-born maidens and so forth that they had received. Thus did khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas, all receive gifts at his hands before they departed. He was still distributing his gifts when evening fell; so he returned to his dwelling, to greet his parents and that night to depart. In gorgeous chariot he proceeded to the place where his parents dwelt, and with him Maddī went, in order to take leave of his parents with him. The Great Being greeted his father and announced their coming.*";
P_HTM[2368]="***To explain this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2369]="***161. “Give greeting to king Sañjaya the righteous: bid him know*";
P_HTM[2370]="***That since he now does banish me, to Vaṅka hill I go.*";
P_HTM[2371]="***162. Whatever beings, mighty king, the future time shall know,*";
P_HTM[2372]="***With their desires unsatisfied to Yama’s house shall go.*";
P_HTM[2373]="***163. For wrong I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,*";
P_HTM[2374]="***By all the people’s sentence I go banished from the land.*";
P_HTM[2375]="***164. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:*";
P_HTM[2376]="***If you will wallow in the slough, yet I will still do good.”*";
P_HTM[2377]="***These four verses the Great Being addressed to his father; and then he turned to his mother, asking her permission to leave the world with these words:*";
P_HTM[2378]="***165. “Mother, I take my leave of you, a banished man I stand.*";
P_HTM[2379]="***For wrong I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,*";
P_HTM[2380]="***By all the people’s sentence I go banished from the land.*";
P_HTM[2381]="***166. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:*";
P_HTM[2382]="***If you will wallow in the slough, yet I will still do good.”*";
P_HTM[2383]="***In reply, Phusatī said:*";
P_HTM[2384]="***167. “I give you leave to go, my son, and take my blessing too:*";
P_HTM[2385]="***Leave Maddī and the boys behind, for she will never do;*";
P_HTM[2386]="***Fair rounded limbs and slender waist, why need she go with you?”*";
P_HTM[2387]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[2388]="***168. “Even a slave against her will I would not take away:*";
P_HTM[2389]="***But if she wishes, let her come; if not, then let her stay.”*";
P_HTM[2390]="***On hearing what his son said, the king proceeded to entreat her.*";
P_HTM[2391]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2392]="***169. “And then unto his daughter-in-law the king began to say:*";
P_HTM[2393]="***‘Let not your sandal-scented limbs bear dust and dirt, I pray,*";
P_HTM[2394]="***170. Wear not bark-fibre wraps instead of fine Benares stuff;*";
P_HTM[2395]="***Blessed princess, go not! Forest life indeed is hard enough.’*";
P_HTM[2396]="***171. Then princess Maddī, bright and fair, her father-in-law addressed:*";
P_HTM[2397]="***‘To be without Vessantara I care not to be blessed.’*";
P_HTM[2398]="***172. Then Sivi’s mighty fostering king thus spake to her again:*";
P_HTM[2399]="***‘Come, Maddī, listen while the woes of forests I explain.*";
P_HTM[2400]="***173. The swarms of insects and of gnats, of beetles and of bees*";
P_HTM[2401]="***Would sting you in that forest life, unto your great dis-ease.*";
P_HTM[2402]="***174. For dwellers on the river banks hear other plagues that wait:*";
P_HTM[2403]="***The boa-constrictor (poisonless ’tis true, but strong and great),*";
P_HTM[2404]="***175. If any man or any beast come near, will take firm hold,*";
P_HTM[2405]="***And drag them to his lurking-place enwrapped in many a fold.*";
P_HTM[2406]="***176. Then there are other dangerous beasts with black and matted hair;*";
P_HTM[2407]="***They can climb trees to catch a man: this beast is called a bear.*";
P_HTM[2408]="***177. Along the stream Sotumbarā there dwells the buffalo;*";
P_HTM[2409]="***Which with his great sharp-pointed horns can give a mighty blow.*";
P_HTM[2410]="***178. Seeing these herds of mighty kine wander the forest through,*";
P_HTM[2411]="***Like some poor cow that seeks her calf say what will Maddī do?*";
P_HTM[2412]="***179. When crowds of monkeys in the trees gather, they will affright*";
P_HTM[2413]="***You, Maddī, in your ignorance with their uncomely sight.*";
P_HTM[2414]="***180. In the past the jackal’s howl would bring great fear to you:*";
P_HTM[2415]="***Now dwelling on the Vaṅka hill, Maddī, what will you do?*";
P_HTM[2416]="***181. Why would you go to such a place? Even at high midday,*";
P_HTM[2417]="***When all the birds are stilled to rest, the forest roars away.’*";
P_HTM[2418]="***182. Then beauteous Maddī to the king spake up and answered so:*";
P_HTM[2419]="***‘As for these things so terrible, which you have tried to show,*";
P_HTM[2420]="***I willingly accept them all; I am resolved to go.*";
P_HTM[2421]="***183. Through all the hill and forest grass, through clumps of bulrush reed,*";
P_HTM[2422]="***With my own breast I’ll push my way, nor will complain indeed.*";
P_HTM[2423]="***184. She that would keep a husband well must all her duties do;*";
P_HTM[2424]="***Ready to roll up balls of dung, ready for fasting too,*";
P_HTM[2425]="***185. She carefully must tend the fire, must mop up water still,*";
P_HTM[2426]="***But terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2427]="***186. The meanest harries her about; she eats of leavings still:*";
P_HTM[2428]="***For terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2429]="***187. Knocked down and smothered in the dust, haled roughly by the hair –*";
P_HTM[2430]="***A man may do them any hurt, all simply stand and stare.*";
P_HTM[2431]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2432]="***188. Men pull about the widow’s sons with cruel blows and foul,*";
P_HTM[2433]="***Though fair and proud of winning charm, as crows would peck an owl.*";
P_HTM[2434]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2435]="***189. Even in a prosperous household, bright with silver without end,*";
P_HTM[2436]="***Unkindly speeches never cease from brother or from friend.*";
P_HTM[2437]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2438]="***190. Naked are rivers waterless, a kingdom without king,*";
P_HTM[2439]="***A widow may have brothers ten, yet is a naked thing.*";
P_HTM[2440]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2441]="***191. A banner is the chariot’s mark, a fire by smoke is known,*";
P_HTM[2442]="***Kingdoms by kings, a wedded wife by husband of her own.*";
P_HTM[2443]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2444]="***192. The wife who shares her husband’s lot, be it rich or be it poor,*";
P_HTM[2445]="***Her fame the very gods do praise, in trouble she is sure.*";
P_HTM[2446]="***193-194. My husband I will follow still, the yellow robe to wear,*";
P_HTM[2447]="***To be the queen of all the earth without, I would not care.*";
P_HTM[2448]="***O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.*";
P_HTM[2449]="***195. Those women have no heart at all, they’re hard and cannot feel,*";
P_HTM[2450]="***Who when their husbands are in woe, desire to be in weal.*";
P_HTM[2451]="***196. When the great lord of Sivi land goes forth to banishment,*";
P_HTM[2452]="***I will go with him; for he gives all joy and all content.’*";
P_HTM[2453]="***197. Then up and spake the mighty king to Maddī bright and fair:*";
P_HTM[2454]="***‘But leave your two children behind: for what can they do there,*";
P_HTM[2455]="***Auspicious lady? We will keep and give them every care.’*";
P_HTM[2456]="***198. Then Maddī answered to the king, that princess bright and fair:*";
P_HTM[2457]="***‘My Jāli and Kaṇhājinā are dearest to my heart:*";
P_HTM[2458]="***They’ll in the forest dwell with me, and they will ease my smart.’*";
P_HTM[2459]="***199. Thus answer made the monarch great, thus Sivi’s foster-king:*";
P_HTM[2460]="***‘Fine rice has been their food and well-cooked viands hitherto:*";
P_HTM[2461]="***If they must feed on wild tree fruit, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2462]="***200. From silver dishes well adorned or golden hitherto,*";
P_HTM[2463]="***They ate: but with bare leaves instead what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2464]="***201. Benares cloth has been their dress, or linen hitherto:*";
P_HTM[2465]="***If they must dress in grass or bark, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2466]="***202. In carriages or palanquins they’ve ridden hitherto*";
P_HTM[2467]="***When they must run about on foot, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2468]="***203. In gabled chambers they would sleep safe-bolted hitherto:*";
P_HTM[2469]="***Beneath the roots of trees to lie, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2470]="***204. On cushions, rugs or broidered beds they rested hitherto:*";
P_HTM[2471]="***Reclining on a bed of grass, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2472]="***205. They have been sprinkled with sweet scents and perfumes hitherto:*";
P_HTM[2473]="***When covered all with dust and dirt, what will the children do?*";
P_HTM[2474]="***206. When peacock’s feathers, yak’s tail fans have fanned them hitherto,*";
P_HTM[2475]="***Bitten by insects and by flies, what will the children do?’ ”*";
P_HTM[2476]="***As they conversed thus together, the dawn came, and after the dawn up rose the sun. They brought round for the Great Being a gorgeous carriage with a team of four Sindh horses, and stayed it at the door. Maddī did obeisance to her husband’s parents, and, bidding farewell to the other women, took leave, and with her two children went before Vessantara and took her place in the carriage.*";
P_HTM[2477]="***Explaining this matter, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2478]="***207. “Then Maddī answered to the king, that lady bright and fair:*";
P_HTM[2479]="***Do not lament for us, my lord, nor be perplexèd so:*";
P_HTM[2480]="***The children both will go with us wherever we shall go.*";
P_HTM[2481]="***208. With these words Maddī went away, that lady bright and fair:*";
P_HTM[2482]="***Along the highroad, and the two children her path did share.*";
P_HTM[2483]="***209. Then king Vessantara himself, his vow performed as bound,*";
P_HTM[2484]="***Does reverence to his parents both, and passes rightwise round.*";
P_HTM[2485]="***210. Then, mounting in the chariot swift, drawn by its team of four,*";
P_HTM[2486]="***With wife and children off he sped where Vaṅka’s peak did soar.*";
P_HTM[2487]="***211. Then drove the king Vessantara where most the crowd did swell,*";
P_HTM[2488]="***And cried: ‘We go! A blessing on my kinsfolk – fare you well!’ ”*";
P_HTM[2489]="***Addressing these words to the crowd, the Great Being admonished them to be careful, to give alms and do good deeds. As he went, the Bodhisatta’s mother, saying: “If my son desires to give, let him give,” sent to him two carts, one on each side, filled with ornaments, laden with the seven precious things. In eighteen gifts he distributed to beggars he met on the road all he had, including even the mass of ornaments which he wore on his own body. When he had got away from the city, he turned round and desired to look upon it; then according to his wish the earth cleft asunder to the measure of the chariot, and turning round, brought the chariot to face the city, and he beheld the place where his parents dwelt. So then followed earthquakes and other wonders; wherefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[2490]="***212. “When from the city he came forth, he turned again to look:*";
P_HTM[2491]="***And, therefore, like a banyan tree great Mount Sineru shook.”*";
P_HTM[2492]="***And as he looked, he uttered a verse to induce Maddī to look also:*";
P_HTM[2493]="***213. “See, Maddī, see the lovely place from which we now have come –*";
P_HTM[2494]="***The king of Sivi’s dwelling-house and our ancestral home!”*";
P_HTM[2495]="***Then the Great Being looking towards the sixty thousand courtiers, who were born when he was, and the rest of the people, made them turn back; and as he drove on with the carriage, he said to Maddī, “Lady, look out and see if any suitors are walking behind.” She sat watching. Now four brahmins, who had been unable to be present at the gift of the Seven Hundreds, had come to the city; and finding that the distribution was over, ascertained that the prince had gone. “Did he take anything with him?” they asked. “Yes: a chariot.” So they resolved to ask for the horses. These men Maddī saw approaching. “Beggars, my lord!” said she; the Great Being stayed the chariot. Up they came and asked for the horses: the Great Being gave them.*";
P_HTM[2496]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2497]="***214. “Then did four brahmins catch him up, and for the horses plead:*";
P_HTM[2498]="***He gave the horses on the spot – each beggar had one steed.”*";
P_HTM[2499]="***The horses disposed of, the yoke of the chariot remained suspended in the air; but no sooner were the brahmins gone than four Devaputtas in the guise of red deer came and caught it. The Great Being who knew them to be Devaputtas uttered this verse:*";
P_HTM[2500]="***215. “See, Maddī, what a wondrous thing – a marvel, Maddī, see!*";
P_HTM[2501]="***These clever horses, in the shape of red deer, drawing me!”*";
P_HTM[2502]="***But then as he went up came another brahmin and asked for the chariot. The Great Being dismounted his wife and children, and gave him the chariot; and when he gave the chariot, the Devaputtas disappeared.*";
P_HTM[2503]="***To explain the gift of the chariot, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2504]="***216. “A fifth came thereupon, and asked the chariot of the king:*";
P_HTM[2505]="***He gave this also, and his heart to keep it did not cling.*";
P_HTM[2506]="***217. Then made the king Vessantara his people to dismount,*";
P_HTM[2507]="***And gave the chariot to the man who came on that account.”*";
P_HTM[2508]="***After this, they all went on afoot.*";
P_HTM[2509]="***Then the Great Being said to Maddī:*";
P_HTM[2510]="***218. “Maddī, you take Kaṇhājinā, for she is light and young,*";
P_HTM[2511]="***But Jāli is a heavy boy, so I’ll bring him along.”*";
P_HTM[2512]="***Then they took up the two children, and carried them on their hips.*";
P_HTM[2513]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2514]="***219. “He carrying his boy, and she her daughter, on they went,*";
P_HTM[2515]="***Talking together on the road in joy and all content.”*";
P_HTM[2516]="***Entering the Forest*";
P_HTM[2517]="***When they met anyone coming to meet them along the road, they asked the way to Vaṅka hill, and learned that it was afar off. Thus it is said:*";
P_HTM[2518]="***220. “Whenever they met travellers coming along the way,*";
P_HTM[2519]="***They asked directions for their road, and where Mount Vaṅka lay.*";
P_HTM[2520]="***221. The travellers all wept full sore to see them on the way,*";
P_HTM[2521]="***And told them of their heavy task: ‘The road is long, they say.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2522]="***The children cried to see fruit of all kinds on the trees which grew on both sides of the road. Then by the Great Being’s power, the trees bowed down their fruit so that their hands could reach it, and they picked out the ripest and gave it to the little ones. Then Maddī cried out, “A marvel!” Thus it is said:*";
P_HTM[2523]="***222. “Whene’er the children did behold trees growing on the steep*";
P_HTM[2524]="***Laden with fruit, the children for the fruit began to weep.*";
P_HTM[2525]="***223. But when they saw the children weep, the tall trees sorrowful*";
P_HTM[2526]="***Bowed down their branches to their hands, that they the fruit might pull.*";
P_HTM[2527]="***224. Then Maddī cried aloud in joy, that lady fair and bright,*";
P_HTM[2528]="***To see the marvel, fit to make one’s hair to stand upright.*";
P_HTM[2529]="***225. One’s hair might stand upright to see the marvel here is shown:*";
P_HTM[2530]="***By power of king Vessantara the trees themselves bend down!”*";
P_HTM[2531]="***From the city of Jetuttara, the mountain named Suvaṇṇagiritāla is five leagues distant; from thence the river Kontimārā is five leagues away, and five leagues more to Mount Arañjaragiri, five leagues again to the brahmin village of Dunniviṭṭha, thence ten leagues to his uncle’s city: thus from Jetuttara the journey was thirty leagues. The gods shortened the journey, so that in one day they came to his uncle’s city. Thus it is said:*";
P_HTM[2532]="***226. “The Yakkhas made the journey short, pitying the children’s plight,*";
P_HTM[2533]="***And so to Ceta kingdom they arrived before the night.”*";
P_HTM[2534]="***Now they left Jetuttara at breakfast time, and in the evening they came to the kingdom of Ceta and to his uncle’s city.*";
P_HTM[2535]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2536]="***227. “Away to Ceta they proceed, a journey great and long,*";
P_HTM[2537]="***A kingdom rich in food and drink, and prosperous, and strong.”*";
P_HTM[2538]="***Now in his uncle’s city dwelt sixty thousand khattiyas. The Great Being entered not into the city, but sat in a hall at the city gate. Maddī brushed off the dust on the Great Being’s feet, and rubbed them; then with a view to announce the coming of Vessantara, she went forth from the hall, and stood within sight. So the women who came in and out of the city saw her and came round.*";
P_HTM[2539]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2540]="***228. “Seeing the auspicious lady there the women round her throng.*";
P_HTM[2541]="***The tender lady! Now afoot she needs must walk along.*";
P_HTM[2542]="***229. In palanquin or chariot once the noble lady rode:*";
P_HTM[2543]="***Now Maddī needs must go afoot; the woods are her abode.”*";
P_HTM[2544]="***All the people then, seeing Maddī and Vessantara and the children arrived in this unbecoming fashion, went and informed the king; and sixty thousand princes came to him weeping and lamenting.*";
P_HTM[2545]="***To explain this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2546]="***230. “Seeing him, the Ceta princes came, with wailing and lament.*";
P_HTM[2547]="***‘Greet you, my lord: we trust that you are prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[2548]="***That of your father and his realm you have good news to tell.*";
P_HTM[2549]="***231. Where is your army, mighty king? And where your royal car?*";
P_HTM[2550]="***With not a chariot, not a horse, you now have journeyed far:*";
P_HTM[2551]="***Were you defeated by your foes that here alone you are?’ ”*";
P_HTM[2552]="***Then the Great Being told the princes the cause of his coming:*";
P_HTM[2553]="***232. “I thank you, sirs; be sure that I am prosperous and well;*";
P_HTM[2554]="***And of my father and his realm I have good news to tell.*";
P_HTM[2555]="***233. I gave the saviour elephant, pole-tuskèd, goodly white,*";
P_HTM[2556]="***Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight;*";
P_HTM[2557]="***234. His jewels, and his yak’s tail fan; which trampled down the foes,*";
P_HTM[2558]="***Long-tuskèd, furious, white as Mount Kelāsa with his snows;*";
P_HTM[2559]="***235. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,*";
P_HTM[2560]="***With leech and driver: yes, I gave away this precious thing.*";
P_HTM[2561]="***236. Therefore the people were in wrath, my father took it ill:*";
P_HTM[2562]="***Therefore he banished me, and I now go to Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2563]="***I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.”*";
P_HTM[2564]="***The princes answered:*";
P_HTM[2565]="***237. “Now welcome, welcome, mighty king, and with no doubtful voice:*";
P_HTM[2566]="***Be lord of all that here is found, and use it at your choice.*";
P_HTM[2567]="***238. Take herbs, roots, honey, meat, and rice, the whitest and the best:*";
P_HTM[2568]="***Enjoy it at your will, O king, and you shall be our guest.”*";
P_HTM[2569]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[2570]="***239. “Your proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.*";
P_HTM[2571]="***But now the king has banished me; I go to Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2572]="***I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.”*";
P_HTM[2573]="***The princes said:*";
P_HTM[2574]="***240. “Stay here in Ceta, mighty king, until a message go*";
P_HTM[2575]="***To tell the king of Sivi land what we have come to know.*";
P_HTM[2576]="***241. Then they behind him in a throng escorting him did go,*";
P_HTM[2577]="***All full of joy and confidence: this I would have you know.”*";
P_HTM[2578]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[2579]="***242. “I would not have you send and tell the king that I am here:*";
P_HTM[2580]="***He is not king in this affair: he has no power, I fear.*";
P_HTM[2581]="***243. The palace folk and townsfolk all in wrath came gathering,*";
P_HTM[2582]="***All eager that because of me they might destroy the king.”*";
P_HTM[2583]="***The princes said:*";
P_HTM[2584]="***244. “If in that kingdom came to pass so terrible a thing,*";
P_HTM[2585]="***Surrounded by the Ceta folk stay here, and be our king.*";
P_HTM[2586]="***245. The realm is prosperous and rich, the people strong and great:*";
P_HTM[2587]="***Be minded, sir, to stay with us and govern this our state.”*";
P_HTM[2588]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[2589]="***246. “Hear me, O sons of Ceta land! I have no mind to stay,*";
P_HTM[2590]="***As I go forth a banished man, nor here hold royal sway.*";
P_HTM[2591]="***247. The Sivi people one and all would be ill pleased to know*";
P_HTM[2592]="***That you had sprinkled me for king, as banished forth I go.*";
P_HTM[2593]="***248. If you should do it, that would be a most unpleasant thing,*";
P_HTM[2594]="***To quarrel with the Sivi folk: I like not quarrelling.*";
P_HTM[2595]="***249-250. Your proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.*";
P_HTM[2596]="***But now the king has banished me: I go to Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2597]="***I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.”*";
P_HTM[2598]="***Thus the Great Being, in spite of so many requests, declined the kingdom. And the princes paid him great honour; but he would not enter within the city; so they adorned that hall where he was, and surrounded it with a screen, and preparing a great bed, they kept careful watch round about. One day and one night he lived in the hall well-guarded; and next day, early in the morning, after a meal of all manner of fine-flavoured food, attended by the princes, he left the hall, and sixty thousand Khattiyas went with him for fifteen leagues, then standing at the entering in of the wood, they told of the fifteen leagues which yet remained of his journey.*";
P_HTM[2599]="***251. “Yes, we will tell you how a king who leaves the world may be*";
P_HTM[2600]="***Good, peaceful by his sacred fire, and all tranquillity.*";
P_HTM[2601]="***252. That rocky mountain, mighty king, is Gandhamādana,*";
P_HTM[2602]="***Where with your children and your wife together you may stay.*";
P_HTM[2603]="***253. The Ceta folk, with faces all bewept and streaming eyes,*";
P_HTM[2604]="***Advise you to go northward straight where high its peaks uprise.*";
P_HTM[2605]="***254. There you shall see Mount Vipula (and blessing with you go),*";
P_HTM[2606]="***Pleasant with many a growing tree that casts cool shade below.*";
P_HTM[2607]="***255. When you shall reach it, you shall see (a blessing with you still)*";
P_HTM[2608]="***Ketumatī, a river deep and springing from the hill.*";
P_HTM[2609]="***256. Full of all fish, a safe resort, its deep flood flows away:*";
P_HTM[2610]="***There you shall drink, and there shall bathe, and with your children play.*";
P_HTM[2611]="***257. And there, upon a pleasant hill, cool-shaded, you will see,*";
P_HTM[2612]="***Laden with fruit as honey sweet, a noble banyan tree.*";
P_HTM[2613]="***258. Then you will see Mount Nālika, and that is haunted ground:*";
P_HTM[2614]="***For there the birds in concert sing and Kimpurisas abound.*";
P_HTM[2615]="***259. There further still towards the north is Mucalinda lake,*";
P_HTM[2616]="***On which the lilies blue and white a covering do make.*";
P_HTM[2617]="***260. Then a thick forest, like a cloud, with grassy sward to tread,*";
P_HTM[2618]="***Trees full of flowers and of fruit, all shady overhead,*";
P_HTM[2619]="***Enter: a lion seeking prey wherewith he may be fed.*";
P_HTM[2620]="***261. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,*";
P_HTM[2621]="***The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.*";
P_HTM[2622]="***262. And if those mountain cataracts you follow to their spring,*";
P_HTM[2623]="***You’ll find a lily-covered lake with blossoms flowering,*";
P_HTM[2624]="***263. Full of all fish, a safe resort, deep water without end,*";
P_HTM[2625]="***Foursquare and peaceful, scented sweet, no odour to offend:*";
P_HTM[2626]="***264. There build yourself a leafy cell, a little to the north,*";
P_HTM[2627]="***And from the cell which you shall make in search of food go forth.”*";
P_HTM[2628]="***Thus did the princes tell him of his fifteen-league journey, and let him go. But to prevent any fear of danger in Vessantara, and with a view to leave no hold for any adversary, they gave directions to a certain man of their country, wise and skilful, to keep an eye upon his goings and comings; whom they left at the entering in of the forest, and returned to their own city.*";
P_HTM[2629]="***And Vessantara with his wife and children proceeded to Gandhamādana; that day he abode there, then setting his face northwards he passed by the foot of Mount Vipula, and rested on the bank of the river Ketumatī, to eat a goodly repast provided by the forester, and there they bathed and drank, presenting their guide with a golden hairpin. With mind full of calmness he crossed the stream, and resting awhile under the banyan which stood on a flat space on the mountain, after eating its fruit, he rose up and went on to the hill called Nālika. Still moving onwards, he passed along the banks of lake Mucalinda to its northeastern corner: whence by a narrow footpath he penetrated into the thick forest, and passing through, he followed the course of the stream which rose out of the mountain until he came to the foursquare lake.*";
P_HTM[2630]="***At this moment, Sakka, King of the Devas, looked down and beheld that which had happened. “The Great Being,” he thought, “has entered the Himālayas, and he must have a place to dwell in.” So he gave orders to Vissakamma: “Go, pray, and in the dells of Mount Vaṅka, build a hermitage on a pleasant spot.” Vissakamma went and made two hermitages with two covered walks, rooms for the night and rooms for the day; alongside of the walks he plants rows of flowering trees and clumps of banana, and makes ready all things necessary for ascetics. Then he writes an inscription, “Whoso wishes to be an ascetic, these are for him,” and driving away all (malicious) Amanussas and all harsh-voiced beasts and birds, he went to his own place.*";
P_HTM[2631]="***The Great Being, when he beheld a path, felt sure that it must lead to some ascetics’ settlement. He left Maddī and the two children at the entrance of the hermitage, and went in; when seeing the inscription, he recognized that Sakka’s eye was upon him. He opened the door and entered, and putting off his bow and sword, with the garments which he wore, he donned the garb of an ascetic, took up the staff, and coming forth entered the covered walk and paced up and down, and with the quietude of a Paccekabuddha approached his wife and children. Maddī fell at his feet in tears; then with him entering the hermitage, she went to her own cell and donned the ascetic dress. After this they made their children to do the like. Thus the four noble ascetics dwelt in the recesses of Mount Vaṅka.*";
P_HTM[2632]="***Then Maddī asked a boon of the Great Being. “My lord, do you stay here with the children, instead of going out in search of wild fruits; and let me go instead.” Thenceforward she used to fetch the wild fruits from the forest and feed them all three. The Bodhisatta also asked her for a boon. “Maddī, we are now ascetics; and woman is the canker of chastity. Henceforward then, do not approach me unseasonably.” She consented.*";
P_HTM[2633]="***By the power of the Great Being’s compassion, even the wild animals, all that were within three leagues of their borders, had compassion one for another.*";
P_HTM[2634]="***Daily at dawn, Maddī arises, provides water for their drinking and food to eat, brings water and toothbrush for cleansing the mouth, sweeps out the hermitage, leaves the two children with their father, basket, spade, and hook in hand goes to the forest for wild roots and fruits, with which she fills her basket: at evening she returns, lays the wild fruits in the cell, washes the children; then the four of them sit at the door of the cell and eat their fruits. Then Maddī takes her two children, and retires to her own cell. Thus they lived in the recesses of the mountain for seven months.*";
P_HTM[2635]="***Jūjaka*";
P_HTM[2636]="***At that time, in the kingdom of Kāliṅga, and in a brahmin village named Dunniviṭṭha, lived a brahmin Jūjaka. He by quest of alms having obtained a hundred rupees deposited them with a certain brahmin family, and went out to get more wealth. As he was long away, the family spent that money; the other came back and upbraided them, but they could not return the money, and so they gave him their daughter named Amittatāpanā. He took the maiden with him to Dunniviṭṭha, in Kāliṅga, and there dwelt. Amittatāpanā tended the brahmin well. Some other brahmins, young men, seeing her dutifulness, reproached their own wives with it, “See how carefully she tends an old man, while you are careless of your young husbands!” This made the wives resolve to drive her out of the village. So they would gather in crowds at the river side and everywhere else, reviling her.*";
P_HTM[2637]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2638]="***265. “Once in Kāliṅga, Jūjaka a brahmin spent his life,*";
P_HTM[2639]="***Who had Amittatāpanā, quite a young girl, to wife.*";
P_HTM[2640]="***266. The women who with waterpots down to the river came,*";
P_HTM[2641]="***Cried shame upon her, crowding up, and roundly cursed her name.*";
P_HTM[2642]="***267. A foe indeed your mother was, a foe your father too,*";
P_HTM[2643]="***To let an old decrepit man wed a young wife like you.*";
P_HTM[2644]="***268-271. Your people brewed a secret plot, a bad, mean, cruel plan,*";
P_HTM[2645]="***To let a fine young girl be wed to an old decrepit man.*";
P_HTM[2646]="***272. A hateful thing your life must be, as youthful as you are,*";
P_HTM[2647]="***With an old husband to be wed; nay, death were better far.*";
P_HTM[2648]="***273. It surely seems, my pretty one, your parents were unkind*";
P_HTM[2649]="***If for a fine young girl they could no other husband find.*";
P_HTM[2650]="***274. Your fire-oblation, and your ninth were offered all for naught*";
P_HTM[2651]="***If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.*";
P_HTM[2652]="***275. Some brahmin or ascetic once no doubt you have reviled,*";
P_HTM[2653]="***Some virtuous or learned man, some ascetic undefiled,*";
P_HTM[2654]="***If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.*";
P_HTM[2655]="***276. Painful a spear-thrust, full of pain the serpent’s fiery bite:*";
P_HTM[2656]="***But a decrepit husband is more painful to the sight.*";
P_HTM[2657]="***277. With an old husband there can be no joy and no delight,*";
P_HTM[2658]="***No pleasant talk: his very laugh is ugly to the sight.*";
P_HTM[2659]="***278. When men and maidens, youth with youth, hold intercourse apart*";
P_HTM[2660]="***They make an end of all the woes that harbour in the heart.*";
P_HTM[2661]="***279. You are a girl whom men desire, you’re young and you are fair:*";
P_HTM[2662]="***How can an old man give you joy? Go home and tarry there!”*";
P_HTM[2663]="***When she heard their mockery, she went home with her waterpot, weeping. “Why are you weeping?” the husband asked; and she replied in this verse:*";
P_HTM[2664]="***280. “I cannot fetch the water home, the women mock me so:*";
P_HTM[2665]="***Because my husband is so old they mock me when I go.”*";
P_HTM[2666]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2667]="***281. “You need not fetch the water home, you need not serve me so:*";
P_HTM[2668]="***Do not be angry, lady mine: for I myself will go.”*";
P_HTM[2669]="***The woman said:*";
P_HTM[2670]="***282. “You fetch the water? No, indeed! That’s not our usual way.*";
P_HTM[2671]="***I tell you plainly, if you do, with you I will not stay.*";
P_HTM[2672]="***283. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,*";
P_HTM[2673]="***I tell you plainly I will go and will not live with you.”*";
P_HTM[2674]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2675]="***284. “How can I buy a slave? I have no craft, no corn, no pelf:*";
P_HTM[2676]="***Come, be not angry, lady mine: I’ll do your work myself.”*";
P_HTM[2677]="***The woman said:*";
P_HTM[2678]="***285. “Come now, and let me tell to you what I have heard them say.*";
P_HTM[2679]="***Out yonder in the Vaṅka hill lives king Vessantara:*";
P_HTM[2680]="***286. Go, husband, to Vessantara and ask him for a slave;*";
P_HTM[2681]="***The prince will certainly consent to give you what you crave.”*";
P_HTM[2682]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2683]="***287. “I am an old decrepit man; the road is rough and long;*";
P_HTM[2684]="***But do not worry, do not weep – and I am far from strong:*";
P_HTM[2685]="***But be not angry, lady mine: I’ll do the work myself.”*";
P_HTM[2686]="***The woman said:*";
P_HTM[2687]="***288. “You’re like a soldier who gives in before the fight: but why?*";
P_HTM[2688]="***And do you own that you are beat before you go and try?*";
P_HTM[2689]="***289. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,*";
P_HTM[2690]="***I tell you plainly, I will go, I will not live with you.*";
P_HTM[2691]="***That will be a most unpleasant thing, a painful thing for you.*";
P_HTM[2692]="***290. When happy in another’s arms you shall behold me soon,*";
P_HTM[2693]="***Dressed gaily at the season’s change, or changes of the moon.*";
P_HTM[2694]="***291. And as in your declining years my absence you deplore,*";
P_HTM[2695]="***Your wrinkles and your hoary hairs will double more and more.”*";
P_HTM[2696]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2697]="***292. “And now the brahmin full of fears to his wife’s will gives way;*";
P_HTM[2698]="***So then tormented by his love, you might have heard him say:*";
P_HTM[2699]="***293. ‘Get me provision for the road: make me some honey-cake,*";
P_HTM[2700]="***Prepare some bannocks too, and set the barley-bread to bake.*";
P_HTM[2701]="***294. And then an equal pair of slaves with me I’ll bring away,*";
P_HTM[2702]="***Who without wearying shall wait upon you night and day.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2703]="***Quickly she prepared the provision, and informed him that it was done. Meanwhile he repairs the weak places about his cottage, secures the door, brings in wood from the forest, draws water in the pitcher, fills all the pots and pans, and donning the garb of the ascetic he leaves her with the words, “Be sure not to go out at improper times, and be careful until I return.” Then putting on his shoes, he puts his bag of provisions over his shoulder, walks round his wife rightwise, and departs with streaming eyes.*";
P_HTM[2704]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2705]="***295. “This done, the brahmin dons his shoes; then rising presently,*";
P_HTM[2706]="***And walking round her towards the right he bids his wife good-bye.*";
P_HTM[2707]="***296. So went he, dressed in holiness, tears standing in his eyes:*";
P_HTM[2708]="***To the rich Sivi capital to find a slave he hies.”*";
P_HTM[2709]="***When he came to that city, he asked the assembled people where Vessantara was. Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2710]="***297. “When further he had come, he asked the people gathered round:*";
P_HTM[2711]="***‘Say, where is king Vessantara? Where can the prince be found?’*";
P_HTM[2712]="***To him replied the multitude who were assembled round:*";
P_HTM[2713]="***298. ‘By such as you he’s ruined; for by giving, giving still,*";
P_HTM[2714]="***He’s banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2715]="***299. By such as you he’s ruined; for by giving, giving still,*";
P_HTM[2716]="***He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaṅka hill.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2717]="***“So you have destroyed our king, and now come here again! Stand still, will you,” and with sticks and clods, kicks and fisticuffs, they chased him away. But he was guided by the gods into the right road for Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2718]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2719]="***300. “So he, upbraided by his wife, in greedy passion’s sway,*";
P_HTM[2720]="***Paid for his error in the wood where beasts and panthers prey.*";
P_HTM[2721]="***301. Taking his staff and begging-bowl and sacrificial spoon,*";
P_HTM[2722]="***He sought the forest where abode the giver of every boon.*";
P_HTM[2723]="***302. Once in the forest, came the wolves thronging around his way:*";
P_HTM[2724]="***He leapt aside, and went confused far from the path astray.*";
P_HTM[2725]="***303. This brahmin of unbridled greed, finding himself astray,*";
P_HTM[2726]="***The way to Vaṅka now quite lost, began these lines to say:*";
P_HTM[2727]="***304. ‘Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the prince all conquering,*";
P_HTM[2728]="***Giver of peace in time of fear, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2729]="***305. Refuge of suitors, as the earth to all that living be,*";
P_HTM[2730]="***Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2731]="***306. All who seek favours go to him as rivers to the sea:*";
P_HTM[2732]="***Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2733]="***307. Like to a safe and pleasant lake, with water fresh and cool,*";
P_HTM[2734]="***With lilies spread, whose filaments cover the quiet pool:*";
P_HTM[2735]="***Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2736]="***308. Like a great fig tree on the road, which growing there has made*";
P_HTM[2737]="***A rest for weary wayfarers who hasten to its shade:*";
P_HTM[2738]="***Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2739]="***309-310. Like Banyan, Sāl, or Mango tree, which on the road has made*";
P_HTM[2740]="***A rest for weary wayfarers that hasten to its shade:*";
P_HTM[2741]="***Who’ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?*";
P_HTM[2742]="***311-312. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?*";
P_HTM[2743]="***Glad I should be, could anyone tell where he may be found!*";
P_HTM[2744]="***313-314. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?*";
P_HTM[2745]="***Great blessing it would be, if one could tell where he may be found.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2746]="***Now the man who had been set to watch, who was ranging the woods as a forester, heard this lamentable outcry; and thought he:*";
P_HTM[2747]="***“Here is a brahmin crying out about Vessantara’s dwelling-place; he cannot be here for any good purpose. He will ask for Maddī or the children, no doubt. Well, I will kill him.” So he approached the man, and as he drew his bow, threatened him with the words, “Brahmin, I will not spare your life!”*";
P_HTM[2748]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[2749]="***315. “The hunter ranging in the wood heard this lament, and said:*";
P_HTM[2750]="***By such as you he’s ruined; for by giving, giving still,*";
P_HTM[2751]="***He’s banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2752]="***316. By such as you he’s ruined; for by giving, giving still,*";
P_HTM[2753]="***He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[2754]="***317. A good-for-nothing fool you are, if leaving home you wish*";
P_HTM[2755]="***To seek the prince in forests, like a crane that seeks a fish.*";
P_HTM[2756]="***318. Therefore, my worthy man, I will not spare your life; and so*";
P_HTM[2757]="***My arrow now shall drink your blood when shot from out my bow.*";
P_HTM[2758]="***319. I’ll split your head, tear out your heart and liver in a trice,*";
P_HTM[2759]="***Like birds to spirits of the road I’ll make you sacrifice.*";
P_HTM[2760]="***320. I’ll take your flesh, I’ll take your fat, I’ll take your heart and head,*";
P_HTM[2761]="***And you shall be a sacrifice as soon as you are dead.*";
P_HTM[2762]="***321. You’ll be a welcome sacrifice, a goodly offering;*";
P_HTM[2763]="***And then you’ll not destroy the wife and children of the king.”*";
P_HTM[2764]="***The brahmin, on hearing these words, was frightened to death, and made a false reply.*";
P_HTM[2765]="***322. “The ambassador’s inviolate, and no man may him kill:*";
P_HTM[2766]="***This is a very ancient rule; so listen, if you will.*";
P_HTM[2767]="***323. The people have repented them, his father misses him,*";
P_HTM[2768]="***His mother pines away for grief – her eyes are waxing dim.*";
P_HTM[2769]="***324. I come as their ambassador, Vessantara to bring:*";
P_HTM[2770]="***Hear me, and tell me if you know where I may find the king.”*";
P_HTM[2771]="***Then the man was pleased to hear that he was come to fetch Vessantara; he fastened up his dogs, and called the brahmin down, and seating him upon a pile of twigs he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[2772]="***325. “I love the envoy and the prince: and here I give to you*";
P_HTM[2773]="***A gift of welcome – leg of deer and pot of honey too;*";
P_HTM[2774]="***Our benefactor how to find I’ll tell you what to do.”*";
P_HTM[2775]="***The Small Wood*";
P_HTM[2776]="***So saying, the man gave the brahmin food, with a gourd of honey and a roast leg of deer, and set him on his way, raising his right hand to point out the place where the Great Being lived: and he said:*";
P_HTM[2777]="***326. “Sir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is Gandhamādan hill*";
P_HTM[2778]="***Where lives the king Vessantara with wife and children still.*";
P_HTM[2779]="***327. With brahmin’s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2780]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.*";
P_HTM[2781]="***328. See yonder, trees with many fruits, green on the mountain side,*";
P_HTM[2782]="***While the dark mountain-peaks uplift till in the clouds they hide.*";
P_HTM[2783]="***329. There shrubs, and creepers, horsear, sāl, and many another tree*";
P_HTM[2784]="***Sway in the wind like drunken men for anyone to see.*";
P_HTM[2785]="***330. High up above the rows of trees the birds in concert sing,*";
P_HTM[2786]="***Najjuha, cuckoo, flocks of them, from tree to tree flitting.*";
P_HTM[2787]="***331. Thronging among the leafy twigs they bid the stranger come,*";
P_HTM[2788]="***Welcome the guest, delighting all who make the woods their home,*";
P_HTM[2789]="***Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.*";
P_HTM[2790]="***332. With brahmin’s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2791]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care.”*";
P_HTM[2792]="***Moreover he said, in praise of the hermitage:*";
P_HTM[2793]="***333-334. “Mango, Jambu plum, Jackfruit, Sāl, all kinds of Myrobalan,*";
P_HTM[2794]="***Bo, Golden Tindook, many more, including the Banyan;*";
P_HTM[2795]="***335. Plenty of figs, all growing low, all ripe, as sweet as sweet,*";
P_HTM[2796]="***Dates, luscious grapes, and honeycomb, as much as you can eat.*";
P_HTM[2797]="***336. The mango trees are some in flower, some with the fruit just set,*";
P_HTM[2798]="***Some ripe and green as any frog, while some are unripe yet.*";
P_HTM[2799]="***337. A man may stand beneath the trees and pluck them as they grow:*";
P_HTM[2800]="***The choicest flavour, colour, taste, both ripe and unripe show.*";
P_HTM[2801]="***338. It makes me cry aloud to see that great and wondrous sight,*";
P_HTM[2802]="***Like heaven where the gods abide, the garden of delight.*";
P_HTM[2803]="***339. Palmyra, date-palm, coconut grow in that forest high,*";
P_HTM[2804]="***Festoons of flowers garlanded as when the banners fly,*";
P_HTM[2805]="***Blossoms of every hue and tint like stars that dot the sky.*";
P_HTM[2806]="***340-341. Ebony, aloe, trumpet-flower, and many another tree,*";
P_HTM[2807]="***Acacias, berries, nuts, and all as thick as thick can be.*";
P_HTM[2808]="***342. Hard by there is a lake bespread with lilies blue and white,*";
P_HTM[2809]="***As in the garden of the gods, the Garden of Delight.*";
P_HTM[2810]="***343. And there the cuckoos make the hills re-echo as they sing,*";
P_HTM[2811]="***Intoxicated with the flowers which in their season spring.*";
P_HTM[2812]="***344. See on the lilies drop by drop the honey-nectar fall,*";
P_HTM[2813]="***And feel the breezes blowing free from out the south and west,*";
P_HTM[2814]="***Until the pollen of the flowers is waften over all.*";
P_HTM[2815]="***345. Plenty of rice and berries ripe about the lake do fall,*";
P_HTM[2816]="***Which fish and crabs and turtles dart seeking with a zest,*";
P_HTM[2817]="***And honey drips like milk or ghee from the flowers one and all.*";
P_HTM[2818]="***346. A frequent breeze blows through the trees where every scent is found,*";
P_HTM[2819]="***And seems to intoxicate with flowers the forest all around.*";
P_HTM[2820]="***347. The bees about the scented flowers fly thronging with their hum,*";
P_HTM[2821]="***There fly the many-coloured birds together, all and some,*";
P_HTM[2822]="***Cooing and chirping in delight, each with his mate they come.*";
P_HTM[2823]="***348. O pretty chicky, happy chap! They twitter and they tweet:*";
P_HTM[2824]="***‘O lovey dovey, deary dear, my pretty little sweet!’*";
P_HTM[2825]="***349. Festoons of flowers garlanded as when the banners fly,*";
P_HTM[2826]="***Blossoms of every hue and tint, sweet odours wafted by,*";
P_HTM[2827]="***Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.*";
P_HTM[2828]="***350. With brahmin’s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2829]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.”*";
P_HTM[2830]="***Thus did the countryman describe the place where Vessantara lived; and Jūjaka, delighted, saluted him in this verse:*";
P_HTM[2831]="***351. “Accept this piece of barley-bread all soaked with honey sweet,*";
P_HTM[2832]="***And lumps of well-cooked honey-cake: I give it you to eat.”*";
P_HTM[2833]="***To this the countryman answered:*";
P_HTM[2834]="***352. “I thank you, but I have no need: keep your provision still;*";
P_HTM[2835]="***And take of my provision; then go, brahmin, where you will.*";
P_HTM[2836]="***353. Straight onward to a hermitage the pathway there will lead,*";
P_HTM[2837]="***Where Accata an ascetic dwells, black-toothed, with dirty head,*";
P_HTM[2838]="***With brahmin dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2839]="***354. Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care:*";
P_HTM[2840]="***Go there, ask the way of him, and he will give you speed.*";
P_HTM[2841]="***355. When this he heard, the brahmin walked round Ceta towards the right,*";
P_HTM[2842]="***And went in search of Accata, his heart in high delight.*";
P_HTM[2843]="***The Great Wood*";
P_HTM[2844]="***356. Then Bhāradvāja went along until he came anigh*";
P_HTM[2845]="***Unto the ascetic’s place, to whom he spake thus courteously:*";
P_HTM[2846]="***357. ‘O holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[2847]="***With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.*";
P_HTM[2848]="***358. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,*";
P_HTM[2849]="***Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?’ ”*";
P_HTM[2850]="***The ascetic said:*";
P_HTM[2851]="***359. “I thank you, brahmin – yes, I am both prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[2852]="***With grain to eat and roots and fruit abundant where I dwell.*";
P_HTM[2853]="***360. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer not annoy,*";
P_HTM[2854]="***And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.*";
P_HTM[2855]="***361. In all the innumerable years I’ve lived upon this ground,*";
P_HTM[2856]="***No harmful sickness that I know has ever here been found.*";
P_HTM[2857]="***362. Welcome, O brahmin! Bless the chance directed you this way,*";
P_HTM[2858]="***Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet I pray.*";
P_HTM[2859]="***363. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kāsumārī sweet,*";
P_HTM[2860]="***And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat,*";
P_HTM[2861]="***364. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,*";
P_HTM[2862]="***O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.”*";
P_HTM[2863]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2864]="***365. “Accepted is your offering, and your oblation, sir.*";
P_HTM[2865]="***I seek the son of Sañjaya, once banished far away*";
P_HTM[2866]="***By Sivi’s people: if you know where he abides, please say.”*";
P_HTM[2867]="***The ascetic said:*";
P_HTM[2868]="***366. “You seek the king of Sivi, sir, not with a good intent:*";
P_HTM[2869]="***I think your honour’s real desire upon his wife is bent:*";
P_HTM[2870]="***367. Kaṇhājinā for handmaiden, Jāli for serving-man,*";
P_HTM[2871]="***Or you would fetch the mother with her children, if you can,*";
P_HTM[2872]="***The prince has no enjoyments here, no wealth or food, my man.”*";
P_HTM[2873]="***On hearing this, Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2874]="***368. “I wish no ill to any man, no boon I come to pray:*";
P_HTM[2875]="***But sweet it is to see the good, pleasant with them to stay.*";
P_HTM[2876]="***369. I never saw this monarch, whom his people sent away:*";
P_HTM[2877]="***I came to see him: if you know where he abides, please say.”*";
P_HTM[2878]="***The other believed him. “Good, I will tell you; only stay with me here today.” So he entertained him with wild fruits and roots; and next day, stretching out his hand, he showed him the road.*";
P_HTM[2879]="***370. “Sir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is Gandhamādan hill*";
P_HTM[2880]="***Where lives the king Vessantara with wife and children still.*";
P_HTM[2881]="***371. With brahmin’s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2882]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.*";
P_HTM[2883]="***372. See yonder, trees with many fruits, green on the mountain side,*";
P_HTM[2884]="***While the dark mountain-peaks uplift till in the clouds they hide.*";
P_HTM[2885]="***There shrubs, and creepers, horsear, sāl, and many another tree*";

P_HTM[2889]="***374. Thronging among the leafy twigs they bid the stranger come,*";
P_HTM[2890]="***Welcome the guest, delighting all who make the woods their home,*";
P_HTM[2891]="***Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.*";

P_HTM[2893]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care.*";
P_HTM[2894]="***376. The foliage of the pepper tree in that fair spot is seen,*";
P_HTM[2895]="***No dust is ever blown aloft, the grass is ever green.*";
P_HTM[2896]="***377. The grasses like a peacock’s neck, soft-cotton to the touch,*";
P_HTM[2897]="***Grow never more than inches four, but always just so much.*";
P_HTM[2898]="***Kapittha, Mango, Jambu plum, and ripe figs dangling low,*";
P_HTM[2899]="***All trees whose fruit is good to eat in that fine forest grow.*";
P_HTM[2900]="***378. There sweet and clean and fragrant streams as blue as beryl flow,*";
P_HTM[2901]="***Through which disporting up and down the shoals of fishes go.*";
P_HTM[2902]="***379. A lake lies in a lovely spot, with lilies blue and white,*";
P_HTM[2903]="***Hard by, like that which in heaven is the Garden of Delight.*";
P_HTM[2904]="***380. Three kinds of lilies in that lake present them to the sight,*";
P_HTM[2905]="***With varied colours: some are blue, some blood-red, others white.”*";
P_HTM[2906]="***Thus he praised the foursquare lake of lilies, and went on to praise lake Mucalinda:*";
P_HTM[2907]="***381. “As soft as linen are the flowers, those lilies blue and white,*";
P_HTM[2908]="***And other herbs grow there: the lake is Mucalinda hight.*";
P_HTM[2909]="***382. And there in number infinite the full-blown flowers you see,*";
P_HTM[2910]="***In summer and in winter both as high as to the knee.*";
P_HTM[2911]="***383. Always the many-coloured flowers blow fragrant on the breeze,*";
P_HTM[2912]="***And you may hear drawn by the scent the buzzing of the bees.*";
P_HTM[2913]="***384. All round about the water’s edge are standing in a row*";
P_HTM[2914]="***The ebony, the trumpet-flower, and tall kadamba trees.*";
P_HTM[2915]="***385-390. Six-Petals and many another tree with flowers all blow,*";
P_HTM[2916]="***And leafy bowers all standing round about the lake one sees.*";
P_HTM[2917]="***There trees of every shape and size, there flowers of every hue,*";
P_HTM[2918]="***All shrubs and bushes, high and low are spread before the view:*";
P_HTM[2919]="***391. The breezes sweetly waft the scent from flowers white, blue, and red,*";
P_HTM[2920]="***That grow about the hermitage wherein the fire is fed.*";
P_HTM[2921]="***392. Close round about the water’s edge grow many plants and trees,*";
P_HTM[2922]="***Which tremble as they echo to the murmurs of the bees.*";
P_HTM[2923]="***393-397. The scent of all the lovely blooms that grow about that shore*";
P_HTM[2924]="***Will last you if you keep them for a week, or two, or more.*";
P_HTM[2925]="***398. Three kinds of gourds, all distinct, grow in this lake, and some*";
P_HTM[2926]="***Have fruit as big as waterpots, others big as a drum.*";
P_HTM[2927]="***399-401. Mustard, green garlic, lilies blue to pick, and flowers full-blown,*";
P_HTM[2928]="***Jasmine, sweet sandal, creepers huge about the trees are grown.*";
P_HTM[2929]="***402. Sweet jasmine, cotton, indigo, and plants of many a name,*";
P_HTM[2930]="***Cress, trumpet-flower, grow all around like tongues of golden flame.*";
P_HTM[2931]="***403-404. Yea, every kind of flower that grows in water or on land,*";
P_HTM[2932]="***In and about this lovely lake lo and behold they stand.*";
P_HTM[2933]="***405-406. There crocodiles and water-beasts abide of every sort,*";
P_HTM[2934]="***Red deer and other animals for water do resort.*";
P_HTM[2935]="***407-408. Turmeric, camphor, panick-seed, the liquorice-plant, and all*";
P_HTM[2936]="***Most fragrant seeds and grasses grow with stalks exceeding tall.*";
P_HTM[2937]="***409-410. There lions, tigers, elephants are seeking for a mate,*";
P_HTM[2938]="***Deer red and dappled, jackals, dogs, and fawns so swift of gait,*";
P_HTM[2939]="***411. Yaks, antelopes, and flying fox, and monkeys great and small,*";
P_HTM[2940]="***Bears, bulls, and other mighty beasts come flocking one and all:*";
P_HTM[2941]="***412-413. Rhinoceros, mongoose, squirrel, boar, dog, jackal, buffalo,*";
P_HTM[2942]="***Loris, hare, speckled panther, wolf and lizard, there they go:*";
P_HTM[2943]="***414-416. Spiders and snakes and hairy things, and every kind of bird,*";
P_HTM[2944]="***Which as they chirp and twitter round all make their voices heard:*";
P_HTM[2945]="***417. Hawk, woodcock, heron, piper, owl, the cuckoo with his flute,*";
P_HTM[2946]="***Partridge, geese, ospreys, pheasants, cranes, and redbacks, follow suit.*";
P_HTM[2947]="***418. There sweetly singing to their mates the gorgeous-coloured things,*";
P_HTM[2948]="***White-tufted, blue-necked, peacock-hued flutter their pretty wings.*";
P_HTM[2949]="***419-427. Why should I try their thousand names in detail to rehearse?*";
P_HTM[2950]="***Imagine every kind of bird, and add them to my verse.*";
P_HTM[2951]="***428. There a melodious company their thousand songs they make*";
P_HTM[2952]="***And fill the air with pleasant noise round Mucalinda lake.*";
P_HTM[2953]="***429. The wood is full of elephants, of antelopes and deer,*";
P_HTM[2954]="***Where hanging down from all the trees great creepers do appear.*";
P_HTM[2955]="***430. There mustard grows, and sugar-cane, and many kinds of rice,*";
P_HTM[2956]="***And beans and other plants and herbs, all comers to suffice.*";
P_HTM[2957]="***431. Yonder the footpath leads you straight unto his settling-ground*";
P_HTM[2958]="***Where never hunger, never thirst, and no distaste is found,*";
P_HTM[2959]="***Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king:*";
P_HTM[2960]="***432. With brahmin’s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic’s matted hair,*";
P_HTM[2961]="***Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care.*";
P_HTM[2962]="***433. When this he heard, the brahmin walked around him towards the right,*";
P_HTM[2963]="***And went to seek Vessantara, his heart in high delight.”*";
P_HTM[2964]="***The Children*";
P_HTM[2965]="***Jūjaka went on by the road pointed out to him by Accata the Ascetic, and arrived at the foursquare lake. “It is now late evening,” he thought, “Maddī will by now have returned from the forest, and women are always in the way. Tomorrow, when she has gone into the forest, I will go to Vessantara, and ask him for the children, and before she comes back I will be away.” So he climbed a flat-topped hill not far off, and lay down in a pleasant spot.*";
P_HTM[2966]="***Now at dawn of the next morning, Maddī had a dream, and her dream was after this fashion: A black man clothed in two yellow robes, with red flowers in his two ears, came and entered the hut of leaves, clutched Maddī by the hair of her head and dragged her out, threw her down on the ground backwards, and amidst her shrieks tore out her two eyes, cut off two arms, cut open her breast, and tearing out the heart dripping with blood carried it away. She awoke in affright, thinking: “I have seen an evil dream; I have no one here but Vessantara to interpret my dream, so I will ask him about it.” Then going to the hut of the Great Being, she knocked at the door. “Who’s there?” “I, my lord, Maddī.” “Lady, why have you come here unseasonably, and broken our compact?” “My lord, it is not from desire that I come; but I have had an evil dream.” “Tell it to me then, Maddī.” She told it as it had appeared; the Great Being understood what the dream meant. “The perfection of my giving,” he thought, “is to be fulfilled; this day comes a suitor to ask for my children. I will console Maddī and let her go.” So he said: “Your mind must have been disturbed by uneasy sleep or by indigestion; fear nothing.” With this deceit he consoled her, and let her go. And when the night grew light, she did all that had to be done, embraced and kissed the children, and said: “Last night I had a bad dream; be careful, my dears!” Then she gave them in charge of the Great Being, begging him to take care of them, took her basket and tools, wiped her tears, and away to the woods for fruits and roots.*";
P_HTM[2967]="***But Jūjaka, thinking that she would now be gone, came down from the hill and went up the footpath towards the hermitage. And the Great Being came out of his hut, and seated himself upon a slab of stone like a golden image. “Now the suitor will come!” he thought, like a drunkard, thirsting for a draught, and sat watching the road by which he would come, his children playing about his feet. And as he looked down the road, he saw the brahmin coming; taking up as it were the burden of his giving, for seven months laid down, he cried in joy, “Brahmin, pray draw near!” and to the boy Jāli he addressed this verse:*";
P_HTM[2968]="***434. “Jāli, arise and stand: behold a brahmin in my sight!*";
P_HTM[2969]="***’Tis the old time come back again, and fills me with delight!”*";
P_HTM[2970]="***Hearing this, the boy says:*";
P_HTM[2971]="***435. “Yes, yes, my father, I behold the brahmin whom you see;*";
P_HTM[2972]="***He comes as though a boon to ask; our guest he needs must be.”*";
P_HTM[2973]="***And with these words, to show him honour, the boy rose up from his seat, and went to meet the brahmin, offering to relieve him of his baggage. The brahmin looked at him, and thought: “This must be Jāli, the son of Vessantara; from the very first I will speak harshly to him.” So he snapped his fingers at him, crying, “Go away, go away!” The boy thought: “A harsh man this, to be sure!” and looking at his body, he perceived in him the eighteen blemishes of a man. But the brahmin came up to the Bodhisatta, and politely greeting him, said:*";
P_HTM[2974]="***436. “O holy man, we trust that you are prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[2975]="***With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.*";
P_HTM[2976]="***437. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,*";
P_HTM[2977]="***Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?”*";
P_HTM[2978]="***The Bodhisatta answered politely*";
P_HTM[2979]="***438. “I thank you, brahmin, and reply: we prosper and are well*";
P_HTM[2980]="***With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where we dwell.*";
P_HTM[2981]="***439. From flies and gnats and creeping things we suffer no annoy,*";
P_HTM[2982]="***And from wild beasts of prey we here immunity enjoy.*";
P_HTM[2983]="***440. Seven months we have lived happy in this forest, and have not*";
P_HTM[2984]="***Once seen a brahmin, as we now see you, godlike, I wot,*";
P_HTM[2985]="***With wood apple-staff and tinder-box, and with the waterpot.*";
P_HTM[2986]="***441. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way;*";
P_HTM[2987]="***Come, enter with a blessing, come and wash your feet, I pray.*";
P_HTM[2988]="***442. The tindook and the piyal leaves, the kāsumāri sweet,*";
P_HTM[2989]="***And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.*";
P_HTM[2990]="***443. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,*";
P_HTM[2991]="***O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.”*";
P_HTM[2992]="***After these words, the Great Being thought: “Not without cause is this brahmin come to this great forest; I will ask him the reason without delay,” and he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[2993]="***444. “Now tell me what may be the cause, what can the reason be,*";
P_HTM[2994]="***That brings you to this mighty wood? I pray you tell to me.”*";
P_HTM[2995]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[2996]="***445. “As a great water-flood is full, and fails not any day,*";
P_HTM[2997]="***So you, from whom I come to beg – give me your children, pray!”*";
P_HTM[2998]="***On hearing this, the Great Being was delighted in heart; and said, like one who sets in the outstretched hand a purse of a thousand pieces of money:*";
P_HTM[2999]="***446. “I give, and shrink not: you shall be their master. But my queen*";
P_HTM[3000]="***Went out this morning for our food; at evening she’ll be seen.*";
P_HTM[3001]="***447. Stay here this night: the morning light shall see you on your way.*";
P_HTM[3002]="***She’ll wash them and perfume them both, and garland them with flowers.*";
P_HTM[3003]="***448. Stay here this night: the morning light shall see you on your way.*";
P_HTM[3004]="***Decked out with flowers they both shall be, with scents and perfumes sweet;*";
P_HTM[3005]="***Take them away, and plenty take of fruits and roots to eat.”*";
P_HTM[3006]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[3007]="***449. “No, mighty monarch, I would go; I do not wish to stay:*";
P_HTM[3008]="***I’ll go, lest some impediment should thwart me in the way.*";
P_HTM[3009]="***450. Women no generous givers are, to thwart they always try,*";
P_HTM[3010]="***They know all sorts of cunning spells, and always go awry.*";
P_HTM[3011]="***451. Let him who gives a gift in faith not see his mother’s face,*";
P_HTM[3012]="***Or she will find impediments: O king, I’d go apace.*";
P_HTM[3013]="***452. Give me your children; let them not behold their mother’s face:*";
P_HTM[3014]="***For he that gives a gift in faith, his merit grows apace.*";
P_HTM[3015]="***453. Give me your children; let them not behold their mother’s face:*";
P_HTM[3016]="***He who gives wealth to such as I, up to heaven goes apace.”*";
P_HTM[3017]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[3018]="***454. “If you wish not to see my wife, a faithful wife is she!*";
P_HTM[3019]="***Let Jāli and Kaṇhājinā their grandfather go and see.*";
P_HTM[3020]="***455. When these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,*";
P_HTM[3021]="***He’ll give you wealth in plenty, full of joy and high delight.”*";
P_HTM[3022]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[3023]="***456. “I fear the spoiling of my goods: O prince, I pray you hear!*";
P_HTM[3024]="***The king may deal me punishment, may slay, or sell, I fear;*";
P_HTM[3025]="***Without wealth and servants, my wife would mock at me, and jeer!”*";
P_HTM[3026]="***Vessantara said:*";
P_HTM[3027]="***457. “When these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,*";
P_HTM[3028]="***The foster-king of Sivi folk, who always does the right,*";
P_HTM[3029]="***Will give you wealth in plenty, filled with pleasure and delight.”*";
P_HTM[3030]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[3031]="***458. “No, no, I will not do this thing which you would recommend:*";
P_HTM[3032]="***I’ll take the children, on my wife as servants to attend.”*";
P_HTM[3033]="***The children, hearing these harsh words, slunk behind the hut, and away they ran from behind the hut, and hid close to a clump of bushes. Even there they seemed to see themselves caught by Jūjaka: trembling, they could not keep still anywhere, but ran here and there, until they came to the bank of the square lake; where, wrapping the bark garments tightly about them, they plunged into the water and stood there concealed, their heads hidden under the lily leaves.*";
P_HTM[3034]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3035]="***459. “So Jāli and Kaṇhājinā here and there ran,*";
P_HTM[3036]="***In deep distress to hear the voice of the pursuing man.”*";
P_HTM[3037]="***And Jūjaka, when he saw nothing of the children, upbraided the Bodhisatta, “Ho, Vessantara! When you gave me the children just now, as soon as I told you that I would not go to the city of Jetuttara, but would make the children my wife’s attendants, you made them some sign, and caused them to run away, sitting there like innocence itself! Such a liar there is not in the world, I’m thinking.” The Great Being was moved. “They have run away, no doubt,” he thought, and said aloud, “Do not trouble about it, sir, I’ll fetch them.” So he arose and went behind the hut; perceiving that they must have fled to the woods, he followed their footprints to the lakeside, and then seeing a footprint where they went down into the water, he perceived that they must have gone into the water: so he called, “Jāli, my boy!” reciting these two verses:*";
P_HTM[3038]="***460. “Come hither, my beloved son, my perfect state fulfil;*";
P_HTM[3039]="***Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.*";
P_HTM[3040]="***461. Be you my ship to ferry me safe o’er existence’s sea,*";
P_HTM[3041]="***Beyond the worlds of birth and gods I’ll cross and I’ll be free.”*";
P_HTM[3042]="***“Come, Jāli, my boy!” cried he; and the lad hearing his voice thought thus, “Let the brahmin do with me what he will, I will not quarrel with my father!” He raised his head, parted the lily-leaves, and came out of the water, throwing himself upon the Great Being’s right foot; embracing the ankle he wept. Then the Great Being said: “My boy, where is your sister?” He answered, “Father, all creatures take care of themselves in time of danger.” The Great Being recognized that the children must have made a bargain together, and he cried out, “Here, Kaṇhā!” reciting two verses:*";
P_HTM[3043]="***462. “Come hither, my beloved girl, my perfect state fulfil,*";
P_HTM[3044]="***Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.*";
P_HTM[3045]="***463. Be you my ship to ferry me safe o’er existence’s sea,*";
P_HTM[3046]="***Beyond the worlds of men and gods I’ll cross and lift me free!”*";
P_HTM[3047]="***She also thought: “I will not quarrel with my father,” and in a moment out she came, and falling on her father’s left foot clasped his ankle and wept. Their tears fell upon the Great Being’s feet, coloured like a lily-leaf; and his tears fell on their backs, which had the colour of golden slabs. Then the Great Being raised up his children and comforted them, saying: “My son Jāli, don’t you know that I have gladly given you away? Behave well so do that my desire may attain fulfilment.” And then and there he put a price on the children, as one puts a price on cattle.*";
P_HTM[3048]="***To his son he said: “Son Jāli, if you wish to become free, you must pay the brahmin a thousand pieces of gold. But your sister is very beautiful; if any person of low birth should give the brahmin so and so much to make her free, he would break her birthright. None but a king can give all things by the hundred; therefore if your sister would be free let her pay the brahmin a hundred male and a hundred female slaves, with elephants, horses, bulls, and gold pieces, all a hundred each.” Thus did he price the children, and comforted them, and took them back to the hermitage. Then he took water in his waterpot, and calling the brahmin to come near, he poured out the water, praying that he might attain omniscience. “Dearer than my son a hundredfold, a thousandfold, a hundred thousandfold is omniscience!” he cried, making the earth resound, and to the brahmin he gave this precious gift of his children.*";
P_HTM[3049]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3050]="***464-465. “The foster-king of Sivi land then took his children both,*";
P_HTM[3051]="***And gave this gift most precious to the brahmin, nothing loth.*";
P_HTM[3052]="***466. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did quake,*";
P_HTM[3053]="***What time the king with folded hands bestowed the children both;*";
P_HTM[3054]="***467. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did shake,*";
P_HTM[3055]="***When Sivi’s king his children gave the brahmin, nothing loth.”*";
P_HTM[3056]="***When the Great Being had made the gift, he was joyful, thinking how good a gift he had made, as he stood looking upon the children. And Jūjaka went into the jungle, and bit off a creeper, and with it he bound the boy’s right hand to the girl’s left, and drove them away beating them with the ends of the creeper.*";
P_HTM[3057]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3058]="***468. “The cruel brahmin bit a length of creeper off; which done,*";
P_HTM[3059]="***He with the creeper bound their hands, and dragged the children on.*";
P_HTM[3060]="***469. And then the brahmin, staff in hand, holding the creeper tight,*";
P_HTM[3061]="***Beat them and drove them on and on before their father’s sight.”*";
P_HTM[3062]="***Where he struck them, the skin was cut, the blood ran, when struck they staggered against each other back to back. But in a rugged place the man stumbled and fell: with their tender hands the children slipped off the light bond, and ran away weeping to the Great Being.*";
P_HTM[3063]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3064]="***470. “The children thus at liberty then from the brahmin fly;*";
P_HTM[3065]="***The boy looks on his father’s face, the tears are in his eye.*";
P_HTM[3066]="***471. Then like a fig-leaf in the wind the little boy did quake,*";
P_HTM[3067]="***Embracing threw his arms around his father’s feet, and spake:*";
P_HTM[3068]="***472. ‘Father, will you dispose of us while mother is away?*";
P_HTM[3069]="***O do not give us till she come! Till she return, O stay!*";
P_HTM[3070]="***473. And will you then dispose of us while mother is away?*";
P_HTM[3071]="***O wait until she shall return, then give us if you will!*";
P_HTM[3072]="***Then let the brahmin sell us both, then let the brahmin kill!*";
P_HTM[3073]="***474. His foot is huge, his nails are torn, his flesh hangs sagging down,*";
P_HTM[3074]="***Long underlip and broken nose, all trembling, tawny-brown,*";
P_HTM[3075]="***475. Pot-bellied, broken-backed, with eyes that chew an ugly squint,*";
P_HTM[3076]="***All spots and wrinkles, yellow-haired, with beard of bloody tint,*";
P_HTM[3077]="***476. Yellow, loose-jointed, cruel, huge, in skins of goats bedight,*";
P_HTM[3078]="***An Amanussa, he was a most terrifying sight;*";
P_HTM[3079]="***477. A man, or monstrous cannibal? And can you tamely see*";
P_HTM[3080]="***This Yakkha come into the wood to ask this boon of thee?*";
P_HTM[3081]="***478. And is your heart a piece of stone fast bound about with steel,*";
P_HTM[3082]="***To care not when this greedy man, who can no pity feel,*";
P_HTM[3083]="***Binds us, and drives us off like kine? At least I would appeal*";
P_HTM[3084]="***479. That sister Kaṇha, who as yet no trouble knows, may stay,*";
P_HTM[3085]="***Now crying like a sucking fawn lost from the herd away.’ ”*";
P_HTM[3086]="***To this the Great Being answered not one word. Then the boy said, lamenting on account of his parents:*";
P_HTM[3087]="***480. “I care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:*";
P_HTM[3088]="***Ne’er more to see my mother’s face, ’tis this that does appal.*";
P_HTM[3089]="***481. I care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:*";
P_HTM[3090]="***Ne’er more to see my father’s face, ’tis this that does appal.*";
P_HTM[3091]="***482-487. Long will my parents mourn and weep, long will they nurse their woe,*";
P_HTM[3092]="***At midnight and at dawn their tears will like a river flow,*";
P_HTM[3093]="***No more to see Kaṇhājinā, whom they had cherished so.*";
P_HTM[3094]="***488. Those clusters of Jambu plum trees which droop around the lake,*";
P_HTM[3095]="***And all the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.*";
P_HTM[3096]="***489. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad and every tree that grows,*";
P_HTM[3097]="***Yea! All the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.*";
P_HTM[3098]="***490. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,*";
P_HTM[3099]="***The place where once we used to play, this day we do forsake.*";
P_HTM[3100]="***491. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,*";
P_HTM[3101]="***That yonder grow upon the hill, this day we do forsake.*";
P_HTM[3102]="***492-493. And all the pretty little toys that once we played with there,*";
P_HTM[3103]="***The horses, oxen, elephants, this day we do forsake.”*";
P_HTM[3104]="***In despite of these lamentations, Jūjaka came and drove him away with his sister.*";
P_HTM[3105]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3106]="***494. “The children to their father said as they were led away:*";
P_HTM[3107]="***O father! Wish our mother well, and happy be your day!*";
P_HTM[3108]="***495. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,*";
P_HTM[3109]="***Give them to mother, and they will somewhat her grief allay.*";
P_HTM[3110]="***496. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,*";
P_HTM[3111]="***When she looks on them, will anon somewhat her grief allay.”*";
P_HTM[3112]="***Now great pain arose in the Great Being because of his children, and his heart grew hot within him: he trembled violently, like an elephant seized by a maned lion, like the moon swallowed in Rāhu’s jaws. Not strong enough to endure it, he went into the hut, tears streaming from his eyes, and wept pitifully.*";
P_HTM[3113]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3114]="***497. “The warrior prince Vessantara thus gave his gift, and went,*";
P_HTM[3115]="***And there within his leafy bower he sadly did lament.”*";
P_HTM[3116]="***What follow are the verses of the Great Being’s lamentation.*";
P_HTM[3117]="***498-499. “O when at morning or at eve for food my children cry,*";
P_HTM[3118]="***Oppressed by hunger or by thirst, who will their want supply?*";
P_HTM[3119]="***500. How will their little trembling feet along the roadway go*";
P_HTM[3120]="***Unshod? Who’ll take them by the hand and lead them gently so?*";
P_HTM[3121]="***501. How could the brahmin feel no shame, while I was standing by,*";
P_HTM[3122]="***To strike my harmless innocents? A shameless man say I!*";
P_HTM[3123]="***502. No man with any sense of shame would treat another so,*";
P_HTM[3124]="***Were it a servant of my slave, and I brought very low.*";
P_HTM[3125]="***503. I cannot see him, but he scolds and beats my children dear,*";
P_HTM[3126]="***While like a fish caught in a trap I’m standing helpless here.”*";
P_HTM[3127]="***These thoughts came into the Great Being’s mind, through his affection for the children; he could not dismiss the pain thinking of how the brahmin cruelly beat his children, and he resolved to go in chase of the man, and kill him, and to bring the children back. But no, he thought: that was a mistake; to give a gift, then to repent because the children’s trouble would be very great, that was not the way of the righteous. And the two following verses contain the reflections which throw light on that matter.*";
P_HTM[3128]="***504. “He bound his sword upon his left, he armed him with his bow:*";
P_HTM[3129]="***‘I’ll bring my children back again; to lose them is great woe.*";
P_HTM[3130]="***505. But even if my children die ’tis wicked to feel pain:*";
P_HTM[3131]="***Who knows the customs of the good, yet asks a gift again?’ ”*";
P_HTM[3132]="***Meanwhile Jūjaka beat the children as he led them along. Then the boy said lamenting:*";
P_HTM[3133]="***506. “How true that saying seems to be which men are wont to tell:*";
P_HTM[3134]="***Who has no mother of his own is fatherless as well.*";
P_HTM[3135]="***507. Life’s nothing to us: let us die; we are his chattels now,*";
P_HTM[3136]="***This cruel greedy violent man, who drives us like his cow.*";
P_HTM[3137]="***508. These clusters of Jambu plum trees, which droop around the lake,*";
P_HTM[3138]="***And all the verdure of the woods, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.*";
P_HTM[3139]="***509. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan tree, and every tree that grows,*";
P_HTM[3140]="***Yea all the many kinds of fruit, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.*";
P_HTM[3141]="***510. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows;*";
P_HTM[3142]="***The place where once we used to play, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.*";
P_HTM[3143]="***511-512. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,*";
P_HTM[3144]="***That yonder grow upon the hill, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.*";
P_HTM[3145]="***513. And all the little pretty toys that once we played with there,*";
P_HTM[3146]="***The horses, oxen, elephants, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.”*";
P_HTM[3147]="***Again the brahmin fell down in a rough place: the cord fell from his hand, and the children, trembling like wounded fowls, ran away without stopping back to their father.*";
P_HTM[3148]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3149]="***514. “Now Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, thus by the brahmin led,*";
P_HTM[3150]="***Somehow got free, and then away and on and on they fled.”*";
P_HTM[3151]="***But Jūjaka quickly got up, and followed them, cord and stick in hand, spitting like the fire at the world’s end, “Very clever you are indeed,” said he, “at running away,” and he tied their hands and brought them back.*";
P_HTM[3152]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3153]="***515. “And so the brahmin took his cord, and so his staff he took,*";
P_HTM[3154]="***And brought them back with beating, while the king was forced to look.”*";
P_HTM[3155]="***As they were led away, Kaṇhājinā turned back, and lamented to her father. Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3156]="***516. “Then spake Kaṇhājinā and said: ‘My father, pray you see –*";
P_HTM[3157]="***As though I were a home-born slave this brahmin thrashes me!*";
P_HTM[3158]="***517. Brahmins are men of upright life: no brahmin he can be.*";
P_HTM[3159]="***A Yakkha sure in brahmin-shape, that leads us off to eat.*";
P_HTM[3160]="***And can you stay and see us led to be a Yakkha’s meat?’ ”*";
P_HTM[3161]="***As his young daughter lamented, trembling as she went, dire grief arose in the Great Being: his heart grew hot within him; his nose was not large enough, so from his mouth he sent forth hot pantings; tears like drops of blood fell from his eyes. Then he thought: “All this pain comes from affection, and no other cause; I must quiet this affection, and be calm.” Thus by power of his knowledge he did away with that keen pang of sorrow, and sat still as usual.*";
P_HTM[3162]="***Ere they had yet reached the entering in of the mountains, the girl went on lamenting:*";
P_HTM[3163]="***518. “Sore are these little feet of mine, hard in the way we go,*";
P_HTM[3164]="***The brahmin drives us on and on, the sun is sinking low.*";
P_HTM[3165]="***519. On hills and forests, and on those that dwell in them, we call,*";
P_HTM[3166]="***We reverently bow to greet the spirits, one and all*";
P_HTM[3167]="***520-521. That haunt this lake; its plants and roots and creepers, and we pray*";
P_HTM[3168]="***To wish our mother health: but us the brahmin drives away.*";
P_HTM[3169]="***If she would follow after us, let her make no delay.*";
P_HTM[3170]="***522. Straight leads unto the hermitage this path by which we go;*";
P_HTM[3171]="***And if she will but follow this, she soon will find us so.*";
P_HTM[3172]="***523. You gatherer of wild fruits and roots, you of the knotted hair,*";
P_HTM[3173]="***To see the empty hermitage will cause you great despair.*";
P_HTM[3174]="***524. Long stayed our mother on her quest, great store she must have found,*";
P_HTM[3175]="***Who knows not that a cruel man and greedy has us bound,*";
P_HTM[3176]="***A very cruel man, who now like cattle drives us round.*";
P_HTM[3177]="***525. Ah, had our mother come at eve, and had they chanced to meet,*";
P_HTM[3178]="***Had she given him a meal of fruit with honey mixed, to eat,*";
P_HTM[3179]="***526. He would not drive us cruelly, when he his meal had hent:*";
P_HTM[3180]="***Cruel he drove us, and our feet loud echoed as we went!*";
P_HTM[3181]="***So for their mother longing sore the children did lament.”*";
P_HTM[3182]="***Maddī*";
P_HTM[3183]="***Now whereas the king gave his dearly beloved children to the brahmin, the earth did resound with a great uproar that reached even to Brahmā’s Realm and pierced the hearts of the deities which dwelt in the Himālayas, who, hearing the children’s lamentation as the man drove them along, thought to themselves, “If Maddī come betimes to the hermitage, not seeing her children she will ask Vessantara about it; great will be her longing when she hears that they have been given away; she will run after them, and will get into great trouble: so they instructed three of the Devaputtas to take upon them the shape of a lion and a tiger and a leopard, and to obstruct her way, not to let her go back for all her asking until the setting of the sun, that she might only get back by moonlight, guarding her safe from the attacks of lions and other wild beasts.*";
P_HTM[3184]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3185]="***527. “A lion, tiger, a leopard, three creatures of the brake,*";
P_HTM[3186]="***Which heard this lamentation loud, thus each to other spake:*";
P_HTM[3187]="***528. Let not the princess back return at eve from seeking food,*";
P_HTM[3188]="***Lest the wild beasts should slay her in our kingdom of the wood.*";
P_HTM[3189]="***529. If lion, leopard, tiger should the auspicious mother slay,*";
P_HTM[3190]="***O where would then prince Jāli be, O where Kaṇhājinā,*";
P_HTM[3191]="***The parent and the children both do you preserve this day.”*";
P_HTM[3192]="***They agreed, and obeyed the words of the Devatā. Becoming a lion, a tiger, and a leopard, they lay down near the road by which she must go. Now Maddī was thinking to herself, “Last night I saw a bad dream; I will collect my fruits and roots and get me betimes to the hermitage.” Trembling she searched for the roots and fruits: the spade fell from her hand, the basket fell from her shoulder, her right eye went throbbing, fruit trees appeared as barren and barren trees as fruitful, she could not tell whether she were on head or heels. “What can be the meaning,” she thought, “of this strangeness today!” and she said:*";
P_HTM[3193]="***530. “Down falls my spade, a throbbing now in my right eye I feel,*";
P_HTM[3194]="***The fruitful trees unfruitful seem, all round me seems to reel!”*";
P_HTM[3195]="***531. And when she turned at evening time to go, the day’s work done,*";
P_HTM[3196]="***Wild beasts beset her homeward path at setting of the sun.*";
P_HTM[3197]="***532. “The hermitage is far, I think, the sun is sinking low*";
P_HTM[3198]="***And all the food they have to eat is what I bring, I know.*";
P_HTM[3199]="***533. And there my prince sits all alone within the leafy hut,*";
P_HTM[3200]="***The hungry children comforting: and I returning not.*";
P_HTM[3201]="***534-535. It is the time of evening meal, O woe is me! ’Tis late:*";
P_HTM[3202]="***Thirsting for water or for milk my children me await;*";
P_HTM[3203]="***536-538. They come to meet me, standing like calves looking for their dam;*";
P_HTM[3204]="***Like wild-goose chicks above the lake – O wretched that I am!*";
P_HTM[3205]="***539. This is the sole and only path, with ponds and pits around:*";
P_HTM[3206]="***And I can see no other road now I am homeward bound.*";
P_HTM[3207]="***540. O mighty monarchs of the woods, O royal beasts, I cry,*";
P_HTM[3208]="***Be brothers now in righteousness, and let me safe go by!*";
P_HTM[3209]="***541. I am a banished prince’s wife, a prince of glory fair;*";
P_HTM[3210]="***As Sītā did for Rāma, so I for my husband care.*";
P_HTM[3211]="***542. When you go home at evening time, your children you can see:*";
P_HTM[3212]="***So Jāli and Kaṇhājinā be given once more to me!*";
P_HTM[3213]="***543. Here are abundant roots and fruits, much food I have to chew:*";
P_HTM[3214]="***The half I offer now to you: O let me safely go!*";
P_HTM[3215]="***544. A king my father, and a queen my mother – hear my cry!*";
P_HTM[3216]="***Be brothers now in righteousness, and let me safe go by!”*";
P_HTM[3217]="***Then the Devaputtas, observing the time, saw that it was time to let her go; and they rose up and departed.*";
P_HTM[3218]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3219]="***545. “The beasts that heard her thus lament with great exceeding woe,*";
P_HTM[3220]="***In voice of sweet and gentle sound, went off and let her go.”*";
P_HTM[3221]="***When the beasts had departed, she returned to the hermitage. Now it was the night of the full moon; and when she came to the end of the covered walk, where she had been used to see her children, and saw them not, she cried out:*";
P_HTM[3222]="***546. “The children, dusty, close to home, are wont to meet me here*";
P_HTM[3223]="***Like calves that seek the mother-cow, like birds above the mere.*";
P_HTM[3224]="***547-549. Like little deer, with pricked-up ear, they meet me on the way:*";
P_HTM[3225]="***With joy and happiness they skip and frolic in their play:*";
P_HTM[3226]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3227]="***550. As goat and lioness may leave their young, a bird her cage,*";
P_HTM[3228]="***To seek for food, so have I done their hunger to assuage:*";
P_HTM[3229]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3230]="***551. Here are their traces, close by home, like snakes upon the hill,*";
P_HTM[3231]="***The little heaps of earth they made all round, remaining still:*";
P_HTM[3232]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3233]="***552. All covered up with dust to me my children used to run,*";
P_HTM[3234]="***Sprinkled with mud, but now indeed I can see neither one.*";
P_HTM[3235]="***553. Like kids to welcome back their dam they ran from home away*";
P_HTM[3236]="***As from the forest I returned; I see them not today.*";
P_HTM[3237]="***554-555. Here they were playing, here this yellow wood apple fruit let fall:*";
P_HTM[3238]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3239]="***556-557. These breasts of mine are full of milk, my heart will break withal:*";
P_HTM[3240]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3241]="***558. They used to cling about my hips, one hanging from my breast:*";
P_HTM[3242]="***How they would meet me, dust-begrimed, at time of evening rest!*";
P_HTM[3243]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.*";
P_HTM[3244]="***559. In the past this hermitage became our meeting-ground:*";
P_HTM[3245]="***But now I see no children here, the whole place spins around.*";
P_HTM[3246]="***560-561. My children must be dead! The place so silent has become –*";
P_HTM[3247]="***The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.”*";
P_HTM[3248]="***Lamenting in this fashion, she came up to the Great Being, and set down the basket of fruit. Seeing him sitting in silence, and no children with him, she said:*";
P_HTM[3249]="***562-563. “Why are you silent? How that dream comes to my thought again:*";
P_HTM[3250]="***The birds and ravens make no sound, my children must be slain!*";
P_HTM[3251]="***564. O sir, have they been carried off by some wild beast of prey?*";
P_HTM[3252]="***Or in the deep deserted wood have they been led astray?*";
P_HTM[3253]="***565. O do the pretty prattlers sleep? On errands do they fare?*";
P_HTM[3254]="***O have they wandered out afar in frolic or in play?*";
P_HTM[3255]="***566. I cannot see their hands and feet, I cannot see their hair:*";
P_HTM[3256]="***Was it a bird that swooped? Or who has carried them away?”*";
P_HTM[3257]="***To this the Great Being made no reply. Then she asked, “My lord, why do you not speak to me? What is my fault?” and said:*";
P_HTM[3258]="***567. “ ’Tis like the wound of arrow-shot, and still more bitter smart*";
P_HTM[3259]="***(But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!)*";
P_HTM[3260]="***568. This is a second wound that you have struck me to the heart,*";
P_HTM[3261]="***That I my children cannot see, that you have nought to say.*";
P_HTM[3262]="***569. And so, O royal prince! This night since you will not reply,*";
P_HTM[3263]="***I think my days are done indeed, and you will see me die.”*";
P_HTM[3264]="***The Great Being thought that he would assuage his pain for the children by harsh speech, and recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[3265]="***570. “O Maddī, royal princess born, whose glory is so great,*";
P_HTM[3266]="***You went for food in early morn: why come you very late?”*";
P_HTM[3267]="***She replied:*";
P_HTM[3268]="***571. “Did you not hear the lion and the tiger loudly roar*";
P_HTM[3269]="***When by the lake their thirst to slake they stood upon the shore?*";
P_HTM[3270]="***572. As in the woods I walked, there came the sign I knew so well:*";
P_HTM[3271]="***My spade fell from my hand, and from my arm the basket fell.*";
P_HTM[3272]="***573. Then hurt, alarmed, I worshipped all the quarters, one by one,*";
P_HTM[3273]="***Praying that good might come of this, my hands outstretched in prayer:*";
P_HTM[3274]="***574. And that no lion, no leopard, hyena, wolf or bear,*";
P_HTM[3275]="***Might tear or harry or destroy my daughter or my son.*";
P_HTM[3276]="***575. A lion, tiger, and leopard, three ravening beasts, laid wait*";
P_HTM[3277]="***And kept me from my homeward path: so that is why I’m late.”*";
P_HTM[3278]="***This was all that the Great Being said to her until sunrise, after which Maddī uttered a long lament:*";
P_HTM[3279]="***576. “My husband and my children I have tended day and night,*";
P_HTM[3280]="***As pupil tends a teacher, when he tries to do what’s right.*";
P_HTM[3281]="***577. In goatskins clothed, wild roots and fruits I from the forest brought,*";
P_HTM[3282]="***And every day and every night for your convenience sought.*";
P_HTM[3283]="***578. I brought you yellow wood apple fruit, my little girl and boy,*";
P_HTM[3284]="***And many a ripe woodland fruit, to play and make you joy.*";
P_HTM[3285]="***579. This lotus root and lotus stalk, of golden yellow hue,*";
P_HTM[3286]="***Join with your little ones, O prince, and eat your portion too.*";
P_HTM[3287]="***580. Give the white lily to your girl, to Jāli give the blue,*";
P_HTM[3288]="***And see them dance in garlands decked: O call them, Sivi, do!*";
P_HTM[3289]="***581. O mighty monarch! Lend an ear while with delightful sound*";
P_HTM[3290]="***Kaṇhājinā sings sweetly, and enters our settling-ground.*";
P_HTM[3291]="***582. Since we were banished, joy and woe in common shared has been:*";
P_HTM[3292]="***O answer! My Kaṇhājinā and Jāli have you seen?*";
P_HTM[3293]="***583. How many holy brahmins I must have offended sore,*";
P_HTM[3294]="***Of holy life, and virtuous, and full of sacred lore,*";
P_HTM[3295]="***That Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!”*";
P_HTM[3296]="***To this lament the Great Being answered not one word. As he said nothing, trembling she sought her children by the light of the moon; and wheresoever they used to play, under the Jambu plum trees or where not, she sought them, weeping the while, and saying:*";
P_HTM[3297]="***584. “These clusters of Jambu plum trees, that droop around the mere,*";
P_HTM[3298]="***And all the fruitage of the woods – my children are not here!*";
P_HTM[3299]="***585. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad, and every tree that grows,*";
P_HTM[3300]="***Yea, all the fruitage of the woods – my children are not here!*";
P_HTM[3301]="***586-587. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,*";
P_HTM[3302]="***The place where once they used to play – but now they are not here.*";
P_HTM[3303]="***588. The fruit that once they used to eat, the flowers they used to wear*";
P_HTM[3304]="***That yonder grow upon the hill – the children are not there!*";
P_HTM[3305]="***589. And all the little toys that once they played with, there are those,*";
P_HTM[3306]="***The oxen, horses, elephants – the children are not there!*";
P_HTM[3307]="***590. Here are the many hares and owls, the dark and dappled deer,*";
P_HTM[3308]="***With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!*";
P_HTM[3309]="***591. The peacocks with their gorgeous wings, the herons and the geese,*";
P_HTM[3310]="***With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!”*";
P_HTM[3311]="***Not finding her darling children in the hermitage, she entered a clump of flowering plants and looked here and there for them, saying:*";
P_HTM[3312]="***592. “The woodland thickets, full of flowers that every season blow,*";
P_HTM[3313]="***Where once the children used to play, but they themselves not here!*";
P_HTM[3314]="***593. The lovely lakes that listen, when the ruddy geese give call,*";
P_HTM[3315]="***When lotus white and lotus blue and trees like coral grow,*";
P_HTM[3316]="***Where once the children played, but now no children are at all.”*";
P_HTM[3317]="***But nowhere could she see the children. Then returning to the Great Being, whom she beheld with his face cast down, she said to him:*";
P_HTM[3318]="***594. “The kindling wood you have not split, the fire you have not lit,*";
P_HTM[3319]="***Nor brought the water as before: why do you idly sit?*";
P_HTM[3320]="***595. When I return unto my den my toil is done away,*";
P_HTM[3321]="***But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!”*";
P_HTM[3322]="***Still the Great Being sat silent; and she distressed at his silence, trembling like a wounded fowl, went again round the places which she had searched before, and returning said:*";
P_HTM[3323]="***596-597. “O husband mine, I cannot see by whom their death has come:*";
P_HTM[3324]="***The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.”*";
P_HTM[3325]="***Still the Great Being said no word. And she, in her longing for the little ones, a third time searched the same places quick as the wind: in one night the space which she traversed in seeking them was fifteen leagues. Then the night gave place to dawn, and at sunrise she came again to the Great Being, and stood before him lamenting. The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3326]="***598. “When she had traversed in the search each forest and each hill,*";
P_HTM[3327]="***Back to her husband she returned, and stood lamenting still.*";
P_HTM[3328]="***599-601. In hills, woods, caves I cannot see by whom their death has come:*";
P_HTM[3329]="***The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.*";
P_HTM[3330]="***602. Then Maddī, dame of high renown, princess of royal birth,*";
P_HTM[3331]="***Lamenting with her arms outstretched fell down upon the earth.”*";
P_HTM[3332]="***“She’s dead!” thought the Great Being, and trembled. “Ah, this is no place for Maddī to die! Had she died in Jetuttara city, great pomp there would have been, two kingdoms would have quaked. But I am alone in the forest, and what can I do?” Great trouble came upon him; then recovering himself somewhat, he determined to do what he could. Rising up he laid a hand on her heart, and felt it to be still warm: he brought water in a pitcher, and although for seven months past he had not touched her body, in his distress he could no longer keep to the ascetic’s part, but with tears in his eyes he raised her head and laid it upon his lap, sprinkling it with water, and massaging her face and bosom as he sat. Then Maddī after a little while regains her senses, and, rising up in confusion, does obeisance to the Great Being, and asks, “My lord Vessantara, where are the children gone?” “I have given them,” says he, “to a brahmin.”*";
P_HTM[3333]="***The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[3334]="***603. “He sprinkled her with water as she fell down faint as dead,*";
P_HTM[3335]="***And when she had come back again to consciousness, he said.”*";
P_HTM[3336]="***She asked him, “My dear, if you had given the children to a brahmin, why did you let me go weeping about all night, without saying a word?” The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[3337]="***604. “I did not speak at once, because I shrank to cause you pain.*";
P_HTM[3338]="***A poor old brahmin came to beg, and so, of giving fain,*";
P_HTM[3339]="***I gave the children: do not fear, O Maddī! Breathe again.*";
P_HTM[3340]="***605. O Maddī, do not grieve too sore, but set your eyes on me:*";
P_HTM[3341]="***We’ll get them back alive once more, and happy shall we be.*";
P_HTM[3342]="***606. Good men should ever give when asked, sons, cattle, wealth, and grain.*";
P_HTM[3343]="***Maddī, rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.”*";
P_HTM[3344]="***Maddī replied:*";
P_HTM[3345]="***607. “I do rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.*";
P_HTM[3346]="***By giving set your mind at rest; pray do the like again:*";
P_HTM[3347]="***608. For you, the mighty fostering king of all the Sivi land,*";
P_HTM[3348]="***Amidst a world of selfish men gave gifts with lavish hand.”*";
P_HTM[3349]="***To this the Great Being answered, “Why do you say this, Maddī? If I had not been able to set my mind at peace by giving my children, these miracles would not have happened to me,” and then he told her all the earth-rumblings and what else had happened. Then Maddī rejoicing described the miracles in these words:*";
P_HTM[3350]="***609. “The earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,*";
P_HTM[3351]="***The lightning flared, the thunder woke the echoes of the hills!*";
P_HTM[3352]="***610. Then Nārada and Pabbata both greatly did rejoice,*";
P_HTM[3353]="***Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods with Sakka, at that voice.*";
P_HTM[3354]="***611. Thus Maddī, dame of royal birth, princess of high degree,*";
P_HTM[3355]="***Rejoiced with him: a greater gift than children none can be.”*";
P_HTM[3356]="***Thus the Great Being described his own gift; and thus did Maddī repeat the tale, affirming that he had given a noble gift, and there she sat rejoicing in the same gift: on which occasion the Teacher repeated the verse, “Thus Maddī.”*";
P_HTM[3357]="***Sakka*";
P_HTM[3358]="***As they were thus talking together, Sakka thought: “Yesterday Vessantara gave his children to Jūjaka, and the earth did resound. Now suppose a vile creature should come and ask him for Maddī herself, the incomparable, the virtuous, and should take her away with him leaving the king alone: he will be left helpless and destitute. Well, then, I will take the form of a brahmin, and beg for Maddī. Thus I will enable him to attain the supreme height of perfection; I shall make it impossible that she should be given to anyone else and then I will give her back.” So at dawn, Sakka went to him.*";
P_HTM[3359]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3360]="***612. “And so when night was at an end, about the peep of day,*";
P_HTM[3361]="***Sakka in brahmin’s form to them first early made his way.*";
P_HTM[3362]="***613. O holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[3363]="***With grain to glean, and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.*";
P_HTM[3364]="***614. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,*";
P_HTM[3365]="***Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?”*";
P_HTM[3366]="***The Great Being replied:*";
P_HTM[3367]="***615. “Thank you, brahmin – yes, I am both prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[3368]="***With grain to glean, and fruits and roots abundant where I dwell.*";
P_HTM[3369]="***616. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer no annoy,*";
P_HTM[3370]="***And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.*";
P_HTM[3371]="***617. I’ve lived here seven sad months, and you the second brahmin found,*";
P_HTM[3372]="***Holding a goat-staff in his hand, to reach this forest-ground.*";
P_HTM[3373]="***618. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way;*";
P_HTM[3374]="***Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet, I pray.*";
P_HTM[3375]="***619. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kāsumārī sweet,*";
P_HTM[3376]="***And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.*";
P_HTM[3377]="***620. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,*";
P_HTM[3378]="***O noble brahmin! Take of it, drink if it be your will.”*";
P_HTM[3379]="***As thus they talked pleasantly together he asked of his coming:*";
P_HTM[3380]="***621. “And now what reason or what cause directed you this way?*";
P_HTM[3381]="***Why have you sought the mighty woods? Resolve me this, I pray.”*";
P_HTM[3382]="***Then Sakka replied, “O king, I am old, but I have come here to beg your wife Maddī; pray give her to me,” and he repeated this verse:*";
P_HTM[3383]="***622. “As a great water-flood is full and fails not any day,*";
P_HTM[3384]="***So you, from whom I come to beg – give me your wife, I pray.”*";
P_HTM[3385]="***To this the Great Being did not reply: “Yesterday I gave away my children to a brahmin, how can I give Maddī to you and be left alone in the forest!” No, he was as though putting a purse of a thousand pieces in his hand; indifferent, unattached, with no clinging of mind, he made the mountain re-echo with this verse:*";
P_HTM[3386]="***623. “Weary am I, nor hide I that; yet in my own despite,*";
P_HTM[3387]="***I give, and shrink not – for in gifts my heart does take delight.”*";
P_HTM[3388]="***This said, quickly he drew water in a pitcher, and poured it upon his hand, and made over Maddī to the brahmin. At that moment, all the portents which had occurred before were again seen and heard.*";
P_HTM[3389]="***The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[3390]="***624. “Then he took up a water-jar, the king of Sivi land,*";
P_HTM[3391]="***And taking Maddī, gave her straight into the brahmin’s hand.*";
P_HTM[3392]="***625. Then was there terror and affright, then the great earth did quake,*";
P_HTM[3393]="***What time he rendered Maddī for his visitor to take.*";
P_HTM[3394]="***626. The face of Maddī did not frown, she did not massage or cry,*";
P_HTM[3395]="***But looked on silent, thinking, ‘He knows best the reason why.’*";
P_HTM[3396]="***627. ‘Both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I let another take,*";
P_HTM[3397]="***And Maddī my devoted wife, and all for wisdom’s sake.*";
P_HTM[3398]="***628. Not hateful is my faithful wife, nor yet my children are,*";
P_HTM[3399]="***But perfect knowledge, to my mind, is something dearer far.’ ”*";
P_HTM[3400]="***Then the Great Being looked upon Maddī’s face to see how she took it; and she, asking him why he looked upon her, cried aloud with a lion’s voice in these words:*";
P_HTM[3401]="***629. “From maidenhood I was his wife, he is my master still:*";
P_HTM[3402]="***Let him to whomso he desire to give, or sell, or kill.”*";
P_HTM[3403]="***Then Sakka, seeing her excellent resolution, gave her praise; and the Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3404]="***630. “Thereat spake Sakka, seeing how her wishes did incline:*";
P_HTM[3405]="***Conquered is every obstacle, both human and divine.*";
P_HTM[3406]="***631. The earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,*";
P_HTM[3407]="***The lightning flares, the thunder wakes the echoes of the hills.*";
P_HTM[3408]="***632. Now Nārada and Pabbata to hear this mighty voice,*";
P_HTM[3409]="***Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods at this hard feat rejoice.*";
P_HTM[3410]="***633. ’Tis hard to do as good men do, to give as they can give,*";
P_HTM[3411]="***Bad men can hardly imitate the life that good men live.*";
P_HTM[3412]="***634. And so, when good and evil go to pass away from earth,*";
P_HTM[3413]="***The bad are born in hell below, in heaven the good have birth.*";
P_HTM[3414]="***635. This is the Supreme Vehicle: both wife and child were given,*";
P_HTM[3415]="***Therefore let him descend no more, but this bear fruit in heaven.”*";
P_HTM[3416]="***When thus Sakka had expressed his approval, he thought: “Now I must make no more delay here, but give her back and go,” and he said:*";
P_HTM[3417]="***636. “Sir, now I give you Maddī back, your fair and lovely wife,*";
P_HTM[3418]="***A pair well-matched, and fitted for a most harmonious life.*";
P_HTM[3419]="***637. Like the inevitable bond ’twixt water and a shell,*";
P_HTM[3420]="***So you with Maddī; mind and heart are both according well.*";
P_HTM[3421]="***638. Of equal birth and family on either parents’ side*";
P_HTM[3422]="***Here in a forest hermitage together you abide,*";
P_HTM[3423]="***That you may go on doing good where in the woods you dwell.”*";
P_HTM[3424]="***This said, he went on, offering a boon:*";
P_HTM[3425]="***639. “Sakka the king of Gods am I, here come your place to see:*";
P_HTM[3426]="***Choose you a boon, O royal sage, eight boons I give to you.”*";
P_HTM[3427]="***As he spoke, he rose into the air ablaze like the morning sun. Then the Bodhisatta said, choosing his boons:*";
P_HTM[3428]="***640. “Sakka, the lord of all the earth, has given me a boon.*";
P_HTM[3429]="***Pray you my father reconcile, let him recall me soon*";
P_HTM[3430]="***And set me in my royal seat: this the first boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3431]="***641. May I condemn no man to death, not though he guilty be,*";
P_HTM[3432]="***Condemned, may I release from death: this second boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3433]="***642. May all the people for their help look only unto me,*";
P_HTM[3434]="***The young, the old, the middle-aged: this the third boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3435]="***643. May I not seek my neighbour’s wife, contented with my own,*";
P_HTM[3436]="***Nor subject to a woman’s will: this the fourth boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3437]="***644. I pray you, Sakka, grant long life to my beloved son,*";
P_HTM[3438]="***Conquering the world in righteousness: this the fifth boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3439]="***645. Then at the end of every night, at dawning of the day,*";
P_HTM[3440]="***May food celestial be revealed: this the sixth boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3441]="***646. May means of giving never fail, and may I give alway*";
P_HTM[3442]="***With hearty gladness and content: this the seventh boon I crave.*";
P_HTM[3443]="***647. Hence freed, may I be straight advanced to heaven, then that I may*";
P_HTM[3444]="***No more be born upon the earth: this the eighth boon I crave.”*";
P_HTM[3445]="***When Sakka, king of Gods, had heard his saying, thus said he;*";
P_HTM[3446]="***648. “Ere long, the father whom you love, will wish his son to see.”*";
P_HTM[3447]="***With this address, Sakka went back to his own place.*";
P_HTM[3448]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3449]="***649. “The Mighty One, the King of Gods, this said, Sujampati,*";
P_HTM[3450]="***After the giving of the boons straight back to heaven went he.”*";
P_HTM[3451]="***The Great King*";
P_HTM[3452]="***Now the Bodhisatta and Maddī lived happily together in the hermitage which Sakka had given them; but Jūjaka, with the children, went on a journey of sixty leagues. The deities watched over the children; when the sun went down Jūjaka used to tie up the children with willows and leave them lying upon the ground, but himself in fear of cruel and wild beasts would climb up a tree and would sit in the fork of the boughs. Then a Devaputta would come to the children in the form of Vessantara, and a Devadhītā in the form of Maddī; they would set free the children, and massage their hands and feet, wash them and dress them, would give them food and put them to rest on a celestial couch: then at dawn they would lay them down again in their bonds, and would disappear. Thus by help of the gods the children went on their way unhurt.*";
P_HTM[3453]="***Jūjaka also was guided by the gods, so that intending to go to the kingdom of Kaliṅga, in fifteen days he came to the city of Jetuttara. The same night, Sañjaya, king of Sivi, dreamt a dream, and his dream was on this fashion: As he was seated in high durbar, a man came and gave him two blossoms into his hand, and he hung them one on either ear; and the pollen fell from them upon his chest. When he awoke in the morning, he asked his brahmins what it meant. They said: “Some relatives of yours, sire, who have been long absent, will return.” So next morning, after feasting on many a dainty dish, he sat in his durbar, and the deities brought this brahmin and set him in the courtyard of the palace. In a moment the king saw the children, and said:*";
P_HTM[3454]="***650. “Whose face is this that yellow shines, dry as though fire did scorch,*";
P_HTM[3455]="***Like some gold bangle – one as though all shrivelled with a torch?*";
P_HTM[3456]="***651. Both like in body, like in marks – who can these children be?*";
P_HTM[3457]="***Like Jāli is the boy, and like Kaṇhājinā is she.*";
P_HTM[3458]="***652. They’re like two little lion cubs that from their cave descend,*";
P_HTM[3459]="***And like each other: and they seem all golden as they stand.”*";
P_HTM[3460]="***After thus praising them in three verses the king sent a courtier to them, with instructions to bring them to him. Quickly he brought them; and the king said to the brahmin:*";
P_HTM[3461]="***653. “Good Bhāradvāja, tell me whence you have those children brought?”*";
P_HTM[3462]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[3463]="***654. “A fortnight since one gave them me, well pleased with what he wrought.”*";
P_HTM[3464]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[3465]="***655. “By what soft speech or word of truth did you make him believe?*";
P_HTM[3466]="***From whom these children, chief of all gifts, did you receive?”*";
P_HTM[3467]="***Jūjaka said:*";
P_HTM[3468]="***656. “It was the king Vessantara, in forest lands who lives,*";
P_HTM[3469]="***Gave them as slaves, who like the earth to all suitors freely gives.*";
P_HTM[3470]="***657. ’Twas king Vessantara who gave his own as slaves to me,*";
P_HTM[3471]="***To whom all suitors go, as go all rivers to the sea.”*";
P_HTM[3472]="***Hearing this, the courtiers spake in dispraise of Vessantara:*";
P_HTM[3473]="***658. “Were he at home, it were ill done by any king that’s good:*";
P_HTM[3474]="***How could he give his children then, when banished in the wood?*";
P_HTM[3475]="***659. O listen to me, gentles all, that here assembled stand,*";
P_HTM[3476]="***How could the king his children give to serve another’s hand?*";
P_HTM[3477]="***660. Slaves male or female he might give, a horse, a mule, a car,*";
P_HTM[3478]="***Or elephants: but how give those who his own children are?”*";
P_HTM[3479]="***But the boy hearing this, could not stomach his father’s blame; but as though raising with his arm Mount Sineru smitten by the windblast, he recited this verse:*";
P_HTM[3480]="***661. “How, grandfather, can he give, when none in his possession are,*";
P_HTM[3481]="***Slaves male or female, elephants, a horse, a mule, a car?”*";
P_HTM[3482]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[3483]="***662. “Children, I praise your father’s gift: no word of blame I say.*";
P_HTM[3484]="***But then how was it with his heart when he gave you away?”*";
P_HTM[3485]="***The lad replied:*";
P_HTM[3486]="***663. “All full of trouble was his heart, and it burned hot as well,*";
P_HTM[3487]="***His eyes were red like Rohinī, and down the teardrops fell.”*";
P_HTM[3488]="***Then spake Kaṇhājinā and said:*";
P_HTM[3489]="***664. “Father, this brahmin see –*";
P_HTM[3490]="***With creepers, like his homeborn slave, my back he loves to beat.*";
P_HTM[3491]="***665. This is no brahmin, father dear! For brahmins righteous be;*";
P_HTM[3492]="***A Yakkha this in brahmin shape, who drives us off to eat.*";
P_HTM[3493]="***How can you see us driven off with all this cruelty?”*";
P_HTM[3494]="***The king, seeing that the brahmin did not let them go, recited a verse:*";
P_HTM[3495]="***666. “You children of a king and queen, royal your parents are:*";
P_HTM[3496]="***Once you would climb upon my hip; why do you stand afar?”*";
P_HTM[3497]="***The lad replied:*";
P_HTM[3498]="***667. “We’re children of a king and queen, royal our parents are,*";
P_HTM[3499]="***But now a brahmin’s slaves are we, and so we stand afar.”*";
P_HTM[3500]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[3501]="***668. “My dearest children, speak not so; my heart is parched with heat,*";
P_HTM[3502]="***My body’s like a blazing fire, uneasy is this seat.*";
P_HTM[3503]="***669. My dearest children, speak not so; you make me sorrow sore.*";
P_HTM[3504]="***Come, I will buy you with a price, you shall be slaves no more.*";
P_HTM[3505]="***670. Come tell me truly as it is, I will the brahmin pay –*";
P_HTM[3506]="***What price your father set on you when he gave you away?”*";
P_HTM[3507]="***The lad replied:*";
P_HTM[3508]="***671. “A thousand pieces was my price: to set my sister free,*";
P_HTM[3509]="***Of elephants and all the rest a hundred each fixed he.”*";
P_HTM[3510]="***The king bade pay the price for the children.*";
P_HTM[3511]="***672. “Up, bailiff, pay the brahmin quick, and let the price be told:*";
P_HTM[3512]="***A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,*";
P_HTM[3513]="***A hundred elephants and bulls, a thousand pounds in gold.’*";
P_HTM[3514]="***673. The bailiff paid the brahmin quick, at once the price was told:*";
P_HTM[3515]="***A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,*";
P_HTM[3516]="***A hundred bulls and elephants, a thousand pounds in gold.”*";
P_HTM[3517]="***Thereto he gave him a seven-storeyed palace; great was the brahmin’s pomp! He put away all his treasure, and went up into his palace, and lay down on his fine couch, eating choice meats.*";
P_HTM[3518]="***The children were then washed and fed and dressed; the grandfather took one on his hip, the grandmother took the other.*";
P_HTM[3519]="***To explain this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3520]="***674. “The children bought, well washed and dressed, richly adorned, and fed,*";
P_HTM[3521]="***And set on their grandparents’ hips, the king then spake and said:*";
P_HTM[3522]="***675-677. ‘Jāli, your parents are we trust both prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[3523]="***With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.*";
P_HTM[3524]="***678. Have they been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,*";
P_HTM[3525]="***And have they from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?’ ”*";
P_HTM[3526]="***The lad replied:*";
P_HTM[3527]="***679. “I thank you, king, and answer thus: my parents both are well,*";
P_HTM[3528]="***With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.*";
P_HTM[3529]="***680. From flies and gnats and creeping things they suffer not annoy,*";
P_HTM[3530]="***And from wild beasts of prey they there immunity enjoy.*";
P_HTM[3531]="***681. Wild bulbs and radishes she digs, catmint and herbs seeks she,*";
P_HTM[3532]="***With jujubes, nuts, and wood apple fruit she finds us food alway.*";
P_HTM[3533]="***682. And when she brings wild fruits and roots, whatever they may be,*";
P_HTM[3534]="***We all together come and eat by night and eke by day.*";
P_HTM[3535]="***683. Our mother’s thin and yellow grown by seeking for our food,*";
P_HTM[3536]="***Exposed to heat, exposed to wind in the beast-haunted wood.*";
P_HTM[3537]="***684. Like to a tender lotus flower held in the hand which fades:*";
P_HTM[3538]="***Her hair is thin with wandering amid the forest glades.*";
P_HTM[3539]="***685. Beneath her armpits clotted dirt, her hair in topknot bound,*";
P_HTM[3540]="***She tends the fire, and clothed in skins she sleeps upon the ground.”*";
P_HTM[3541]="***Thus having described his mother’s hardships, he reproached his grandfather in these words:*";
P_HTM[3542]="***686. “It is the custom in the world that each man loves his son;*";
P_HTM[3543]="***But this in one case it would seem your honour has not done.”*";
P_HTM[3544]="***The king acknowledged his fault:*";
P_HTM[3545]="***687. “It was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,*";
P_HTM[3546]="***When by the people’s voice I drove my son to banishment.*";
P_HTM[3547]="***688. Then all the wealth which I possess, all that I have in hand,*";
P_HTM[3548]="***Be his; and let Vessantara come and rule in Sivi land.”*";
P_HTM[3549]="***The lad replied:*";
P_HTM[3550]="***689. “Not for my word will he return, the chief of Sivi land:*";
P_HTM[3551]="***Then go thyself and fill your son with blessings from your hand.”*";
P_HTM[3552]="***Then to his general-in-chief king Sañjaya thus said:*";
P_HTM[3553]="***690. “My horses, chariots, elephants, and soldiers go prepare,*";
P_HTM[3554]="***And let the people come around, the family priests all be there.*";
P_HTM[3555]="***691. The sixty thousand warrior lords armed and adorned so fair,*";
P_HTM[3556]="***Dressed up in blue or brown or white, with bloodred crests, be there.*";
P_HTM[3557]="***692-694. Like as the spirit-haunted hills, where trees a plenty grow,*";
P_HTM[3558]="***Are bright and sweet with plants divine, so here the breezes blow.*";
P_HTM[3559]="***695-696. Bring fourteen thousand elephants, with trappings all of gold,*";
P_HTM[3560]="***With drivers holding lance and hook: as many horse be told.*";
P_HTM[3561]="***697-698. Sindh horses, all of noble breed, and very swift to go,*";
P_HTM[3562]="***Each ridden by a henchman bold, and, holding sword and bow.*";
P_HTM[3563]="***699. Let fourteen thousand chariots be yoked and well arrayed,*";
P_HTM[3564]="***Their wheels well wrought of iron bands, and all with gold inlaid.*";
P_HTM[3565]="***700. Let them prepare the banners there, the shields and coats of mail,*";
P_HTM[3566]="***And bows withal, those men of war that strike and do not fail.”*";
P_HTM[3567]="***Thus the king described the constitution of his army; and he gave orders to level the road from Jetuttara away to Mount Vaṅka to a width of eight rods, and thus and thus to decorate it. He said:*";
P_HTM[3568]="***701. “Strow lāja flowers all about, and scented garlands strow,*";
P_HTM[3569]="***Let there be pious offerings on the way that he shall go.*";
P_HTM[3570]="***702. Each hamlet bring a hundred jars of wine for those who wish,*";
P_HTM[3571]="***And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.*";
P_HTM[3572]="***703. Let flesh and cakes be ready there, soup garnished well with fish,*";
P_HTM[3573]="***And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.*";
P_HTM[3574]="***704. Wine, oil, and ghee, milk, millet, rice, and curds in many a dish,*";
P_HTM[3575]="***Let them be set beside the road by which my son shall go.*";
P_HTM[3576]="***705-706. Cooks and confectioners be there, and men to sing or play,*";
P_HTM[3577]="***Dancers and tumblers, tomtom men, to drive dull care away.*";
P_HTM[3578]="***707. The lutes give voice, the harsh-mouthed conch, and let the people thrum*";
P_HTM[3579]="***On timbrels and on tabours and on every kind of drum.”*";
P_HTM[3580]="***Thus the king described the preparation of the road.*";
P_HTM[3581]="***But Jūjaka ate too much and could not digest it, so he died on the spot. The king arranged for his funeral: proclamation was made through the city by beat of drum, but no relative could be found, and his goods fell to the king again.*";
P_HTM[3582]="***On the seventh day, all the host assembled. The king in great ceremony set out with Jāli as his guide.*";
P_HTM[3583]="***This the Teacher explained as follows:*";
P_HTM[3584]="***708. “Then did the mighty host set forth, the army of the land,*";
P_HTM[3585]="***And went towards the Vaṅka hill, while Jāli led the band.*";
P_HTM[3586]="***709. The elephant of sixty years gave forth a trumpet sound,*";
P_HTM[3587]="***Loud trumpeted the mighty beast what time his girth they bound.*";
P_HTM[3588]="***710. Then rattled loud the chariot wheels, then neighed the horses loud,*";
P_HTM[3589]="***As the great army marched along the dust rose in a cloud.*";
P_HTM[3590]="***711. For every need provided well the host marched with a will,*";
P_HTM[3591]="***And Jāli led the army on as guide to Vaṅka hill.*";
P_HTM[3592]="***712. They entered in the forest wide, so full of birds and trees,*";
P_HTM[3593]="***With every kind of flowering plant and any fruit you please.*";
P_HTM[3594]="***713. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,*";
P_HTM[3595]="***The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.*";
P_HTM[3596]="***714. A night and day they marched, and came to the end of their long road,*";
P_HTM[3597]="***And entered on the district where Vessantara abode.”*";
P_HTM[3598]="***The Acts of the Six Nobles*";
P_HTM[3599]="***On the banks of lake Mucalinda, prince Jāli caused them to set up a camp: the fourteen thousand chariots he set facing the road by which they came, and a guard here and there to keep off lions, tigers, rhinoceros, and other wild beasts. There was a great noise of elephants and so forth; this the Great Being heard, and scared to death thought he, “Have they killed my father and come here after me!” Taking Maddī with him he climbed a hill and surveyed the army.*";
P_HTM[3600]="***Explaining this, the Teacher said:*";
P_HTM[3601]="***715. “The noise of this approaching host Vessantara did hear;*";
P_HTM[3602]="***He climbed a hill and looked upon the army, full of fear.*";
P_HTM[3603]="***716. ‘O listen, Maddī, how the woods are full of roaring sound,*";
P_HTM[3604]="***The neighing of the horses hear, the banners see around.*";
P_HTM[3605]="***717. Can they be hunters, who with pits or hunting-nets or knives*";
P_HTM[3606]="***Seek the wild creatures in the woods with shouts to take their lives?*";
P_HTM[3607]="***718. So we, exiled though innocent, in this wild forest land,*";
P_HTM[3608]="***Expect a cruel death, now fallen into an enemy’s hand.’ ”*";
P_HTM[3609]="***When she had heard these words, she looked at the army, and convinced that it was their own army, she recited this verse to comfort him:*";
P_HTM[3610]="***719. “All will be well: your enemies can do no hurt to thee,*";
P_HTM[3611]="***No more than any flame of fire could overcome the sea.”*";
P_HTM[3612]="***So the Great Being was reassured, and with Maddī came down from the hill and sat before his hut. This the Teacher explained:*";
P_HTM[3613]="***720. “Then king Vessantara hereat descended from the hill,*";
P_HTM[3614]="***And sat before his leafy hut and bade his heart be still.”*";
P_HTM[3615]="***At that moment, Sañjaya sent for his queen, and said to her, “My dear Phusatī, if we all go together it will be a great shock, so I will first go alone. When you feel that they must be quiet and reassured, you may come with a company.” After a little time he told Jāli and Kaṇhājinā to come. He turned his chariot to face the road by which he had come, and set a guard in this place and in that, mounted upon his caparisoned elephant, and went to seek his son.*";
P_HTM[3616]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3617]="***721. “He set his army in array, his car turned to the road,*";
P_HTM[3618]="***And sought the forest where his son in loneliness abode.*";
P_HTM[3619]="***722. Upon his elephant, his robe over one shoulder thrown,*";
P_HTM[3620]="***Clasping his upraised hands, he went to give his son the throne.*";
P_HTM[3621]="***723. Then he beheld the beauteous prince, fearless, composed in will,*";
P_HTM[3622]="***Seated before his hut of leaves and meditating still.*";
P_HTM[3623]="***724. Vessantara and Maddī then their father went to greet,*";
P_HTM[3624]="***As they beheld him drawing nigh, eager his son to see.*";
P_HTM[3625]="***725. Then Maddī made obeisance, laid her head before his feet,*";
P_HTM[3626]="***Then he embraced them; with his hand he stroked them pleasantly.”*";
P_HTM[3627]="***Then weeping and lamenting for sorrow, the king spoke kindly to them.*";
P_HTM[3628]="***726. “I hope and trust, my son, that you are prosperous and well,*";
P_HTM[3629]="***With grain to glean and fruits and roots abundant where you dwell.*";
P_HTM[3630]="***727. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,*";
P_HTM[3631]="***And have you from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?”*";
P_HTM[3632]="***The Great Being answered his father:*";
P_HTM[3633]="***728. “My lord, the life we had to live a wretched life has been;*";
P_HTM[3634]="***We had to live as best we could, to eat what we could glean.*";
P_HTM[3635]="***729. Adversity breaks in a man, just as a charioteer*";
P_HTM[3636]="***Breaks in a horse: adversity, O king, has tamed us here.*";
P_HTM[3637]="***730. But ’tis our parents’ absence which has made our bodies thin,*";
P_HTM[3638]="***Banished, O king, and with the woods and forests to live in.”*";
P_HTM[3639]="***After this he asked the fate of his children.*";
P_HTM[3640]="***731. “But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, your hapless heirs, whom now,*";
P_HTM[3641]="***A brahmin cruel, merciless, drives on like any cow,*";
P_HTM[3642]="***732. If you know anything of these the royal children, tell,*";
P_HTM[3643]="***As a physician tries to make a man with snake-bite well.”*";
P_HTM[3644]="***The king said:*";
P_HTM[3645]="***733. “Both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, your children, now are bought:*";
P_HTM[3646]="***I paid the brahmin: therefore be consoled, my son, fear nought.”*";
P_HTM[3647]="***The Great Being was consoled to hear this, and conversed pleasantly with his father.*";
P_HTM[3648]="***734. “I hope, dear father, you are well, and trouble comes no more,*";
P_HTM[3649]="***And that my mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.”*";
P_HTM[3650]="***The king replied:*";
P_HTM[3651]="***735. “Thank you, my son, I am quite well, and trouble comes no more,*";
P_HTM[3652]="***So too your mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.”*";
P_HTM[3653]="***The Great Being said:*";
P_HTM[3654]="***736. “I hope the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,*";
P_HTM[3655]="***The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.”*";
P_HTM[3656]="***The king replied:*";
P_HTM[3657]="***737. “O yes, the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,*";
P_HTM[3658]="***The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.”*";
P_HTM[3659]="***As they thus talked together, queen Phusatī, feeling sure that they must be all relieved from anxiety, came to her son with a great company.*";
P_HTM[3660]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3661]="***738. “Now while they talked together thus, the mother there was seen*";
P_HTM[3662]="***Approaching to the door afoot, barefooted though a queen.*";
P_HTM[3663]="***739. Vessantara and Maddī then their mother went to greet,*";
P_HTM[3664]="***And Maddī ran and laid her head before her mother’s feet.*";
P_HTM[3665]="***740. The children safe and sound afar then Maddī did espy,*";
P_HTM[3666]="***Like little calves that see their dam loud greetings they did cry.*";
P_HTM[3667]="***741. And Maddī saw them safe and sound: like one possessed she sped,*";
P_HTM[3668]="***Trembling, and felt all full of milk the breasts at which they fed.”*";
P_HTM[3669]="***At that moment the hills resounded, the earth quaked, the great ocean was troubled, Sineru, king of mountains, bent down: the six abodes of the gods were all one mighty sound. Sakka, King of the Devas, perceived that six royal personages and their attendants lay senseless on the ground, and not one of them could arise and sprinkle the others with water; so he resolved to produce a shower of rain. This he did, so that those who wished to be wet were wet, and those who did not, not a drop of rain fell upon them, but the water ran off as it runs from a lotus-leaf. That rain was like rain that falls on a clump of lotus-lilies. The six royal persons were restored to their senses, and all the people cried out at the marvel, how the rain fell on the group of kinsfolk, and the great earth did quake.*";
P_HTM[3670]="***This the Teacher explained as follows:*";
P_HTM[3671]="***742. “When these of kindred blood were met, a mighty sound outspake,*";
P_HTM[3672]="***That all the hills reechoed round, and the great earth did quake.*";
P_HTM[3673]="***743. God brought a mighty cloud wherefrom he sent a shower of rain,*";
P_HTM[3674]="***When as the king Vessantara his kindred met again.*";
P_HTM[3675]="***744. King, queen, and son, and daughter-in-law, and grandsons, all were there,*";
P_HTM[3676]="***When they were met their flesh did creep with rising of the hair.*";
P_HTM[3677]="***The people clapped their hands and loud made to the king a prayer:*";
P_HTM[3678]="***745. They called upon Vessantara and Maddī, one and all:*";
P_HTM[3679]="***‘Be you our lord, be king and queen, and listen to our call!’ ”*";
P_HTM[3680]="***The City*";
P_HTM[3681]="***Then the Great Being addressed his father:*";
P_HTM[3682]="***746. “You and the people, countryfolk and townsfolk, banished me,*";
P_HTM[3683]="***When I upon my royal throne was ruling righteously.”*";
P_HTM[3684]="***The king replied, to allay his son’s resentment:*";
P_HTM[3685]="***747. “It was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,*";
P_HTM[3686]="***When by the people’s voice I drove my son to banishment.”*";
P_HTM[3687]="***After reciting this verse, he added yet another, to ask for relief from his own sorrow:*";
P_HTM[3688]="***748. “A father’s or a mother’s pain, or sister’s, to relieve,*";
P_HTM[3689]="***A man should never hesitate his very life to give.”*";
P_HTM[3690]="***The Bodhisatta, who had been desirous of resuming his royalty, but had refrained from saying so much in order to inspire respect, now agreed; whereupon the sixty thousand courtiers, his birthmates, cried out:*";
P_HTM[3691]="***749. “ ’Tis time to wash, O mighty king – wash off the dust and dirt!”*";
P_HTM[3692]="***But the Great Being replied, “Wait a little.” Then he entered his hut, and took off his ascetic’s dress, and put it away. Next he came out of the hut, and said: “This is the place where I have spent nine months and a half in ascetic practices, where I attained the summit of perfection in giving, and where the earth did quake.” Thrice he went about the hut rightwise and made the five-fold prostration before it. Then they attended to his hair and beard, and poured over him the water of consecration, while he shone in all his magnificence like the King of the Devas. So it is said:*";
P_HTM[3693]="***750. “Then did the king Vessantara wash off the dust and dirt.”*";
P_HTM[3694]="***Great was his glory: every place quaked that he looked on, those skilled in auspicious words uttered them, they caught up all manner of musical instruments; over the mighty ocean there was a sound like the noise of thunder; the precious elephant they brought richly caparisoned, and girding himself with an expensive sword he mounted the precious elephant, while the sixty thousand courtiers, his birthmates, compassed him around in gorgeous array. Maddī also they bathed and adorned and sprinkled with the water of consecration, and as they poured the water they cried aloud: “May Vessantara protect you!” with other words of good omen.*";
P_HTM[3695]="***The Teacher explained it thus:*";
P_HTM[3696]="***751. “With well-washed head and goodly robes and ornaments of state,*";
P_HTM[3697]="***Girt with his awful sword he rode the elephant his mate.*";
P_HTM[3698]="***752. And then the sixty thousand chiefs, so beauteous to view,*";
P_HTM[3699]="***His birthmates, came about their lord and did obeisance due.*";
P_HTM[3700]="***753. The women then bathed Maddī, and all together pray –*";
P_HTM[3701]="***Vessantara and Sañjaya preserve you all alway!*";
P_HTM[3702]="***754-755. Thus reestablished, and their past trouble remembering,*";
P_HTM[3703]="***There in the pleasant master’s land they made a merry cheer.*";
P_HTM[3704]="***756. Thus reestablished, and the past trouble remembering,*";
P_HTM[3705]="***Happy and glad the lady went with her own children dear.”*";
P_HTM[3706]="***So in happiness she said to her children:*";
P_HTM[3707]="***757. “I only ate one meal a day, I slept upon the ground,*";
P_HTM[3708]="***That was my vow for love of you until you should be found.*";
P_HTM[3709]="***758. But now my vow is brought to pass, and now again I pray,*";
P_HTM[3710]="***What good so ever we have done preserve you both alway,*";
P_HTM[3711]="***And may the great king Sañjaya preserve you both alway.*";
P_HTM[3712]="***759. What good so ever has been done by father or by me,*";
P_HTM[3713]="***By that truth grow you never old, immortal do you be.”*";
P_HTM[3714]="***Queen Phusatī said also, “Henceforth let my daughter-in-law be robed in these robes, and wear these ornaments!” These she sent her in boxes.*";
P_HTM[3715]="***This the Teacher explained thus:*";
P_HTM[3716]="***760. “Garments of cotton and of silk, linen and cloth so fine*";
P_HTM[3717]="***Her mother-in-law to Maddī sent which made her beauty shine.*";
P_HTM[3718]="***761-764. Necklet and bracelet, frontlet-piece, foot-bangle, jewelled zone,*";
P_HTM[3719]="***Her mother-in-law to Maddī sent, wherewith her beauty shone.*";
P_HTM[3720]="***765. And when the princess passing fair her jewellery surveyed,*";
P_HTM[3721]="***She shone, as shines in Nandana the Devakaññā arrayed.*";
P_HTM[3722]="***766. With well-washed head and ornaments and goodly robes to see,*";
P_HTM[3723]="***She shone, like to some Accharā before the Thirty-Three.*";
P_HTM[3724]="***767. As when in Cittalatā Grove the wind a plantain sways,*";
P_HTM[3725]="***The princess of the beauteous lips looked lovely as that tree.*";
P_HTM[3726]="***768. Like as a brilliant-feathered bird that flies the airy ways,*";
P_HTM[3727]="***She with her pretty pouting lips and beauty did amaze.*";
P_HTM[3728]="***769. They brought a fine young elephant, a mighty and a strong,*";
P_HTM[3729]="***Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.*";
P_HTM[3730]="***770. She mounts upon the elephant, so mighty and so strong,*";
P_HTM[3731]="***Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.”*";
P_HTM[3732]="***So they two in great pomp proceeded to the camp. King Sañjaya and his innumerable host amused themselves in hill sports and woodland sports for a whole month. During that time, by the Great Being’s glory, no hurt was done in all that great forest by wild beast or bird.*";
P_HTM[3733]="***The Teacher thus explained it:*";
P_HTM[3734]="***771-772. “By glory of Vessantara, through all that mighty wood,*";
P_HTM[3735]="***No beast or bird did any harm to the others, all did good.*";
P_HTM[3736]="***773-776. And when he was to go away, they all with one consent,*";
P_HTM[3737]="***Birds, beasts, and all the creatures of the wood, together went:*";
P_HTM[3738]="***But silent were all pleasant sounds when he had left the wood.”*";
P_HTM[3739]="***After the month’s merry-making, Sañjaya summoned his captain-in-chief, and said: “We have stayed a long time in the forest; is the road ready for my son’s return?” He replied, “Yes, my lord, it is time to go.” He sent word to Vessantara, and with his army departed, following with all his host the road which had been prepared from the heart of Vaṅka hill to the city of Jetuttara.*";
P_HTM[3740]="***This the Teacher explained as follows:*";
P_HTM[3741]="***777. “The royal road was newly made, with flowers and bunting fair arrayed*";
P_HTM[3742]="***From where he lived in forest glade down to the town Jetuttara.*";
P_HTM[3743]="***778-779. His sixty thousand mates around, and boys and women places found,*";
P_HTM[3744]="***Brahmins and vesiyas, homeward bound unto the town Jetuttara.*";
P_HTM[3745]="***780. There many an elephant mahout, the charioteers and men afoot,*";
P_HTM[3746]="***With all the royal guard to boot were going to Jetuttara.*";
P_HTM[3747]="***781. Warriors that skulls or pelties wore, of mailed men with swords good store,*";
P_HTM[3748]="***To guard the prince went on before down to the town Jetuttara.”*";
P_HTM[3749]="***The king traversed this journey of sixty leagues in two months. He then entered Jetuttara, decorated to receive him, and went up to the palace.*";
P_HTM[3750]="***This the Teacher explained:*";
P_HTM[3751]="***782. “Then the fair city entered they, with walls and arches high,*";
P_HTM[3752]="***With songs and dances, food and drink in plentiful supply.*";
P_HTM[3753]="***783. Delighted were the country folk and people of the town*";
P_HTM[3754]="***To welcome back to Sivi land their prince of high renown.*";
P_HTM[3755]="***784. All waved their kerchiefs in the air to see the giver come;*";
P_HTM[3756]="***Now is a goal-delivery proclaimed by beat of drum.”*";
P_HTM[3757]="***So king Vessantara set free all creatures, down to the very cats; and on the day that he entered the city, in the evening, he thought: “When day dawns, the suitors who have heard of my return will come, and what shall I give them?” At that moment Sakka’s throne grew hot: he considered, and saw the reason. He brought down a rain of the seven kinds of jewels like a thundershower, filling the back and front of the palace with them waist-high, and over all the city knee-deep. Next day, he allotted this or that place to various families and let them pick up the jewels; the rest he made to be collected and placed in his own dwelling with his treasure; and in his treasuries he had enough to distribute always in future.*";
P_HTM[3758]="***This the Teacher explained as follows: 785. “When as Vessantara came back, Sivi’s protector king,*";
P_HTM[3759]="***The god a shower of precious gold upon the place did bring.*";
P_HTM[3760]="***786. So when Vessantara the prince his generous gifts had given;*";
P_HTM[3761]="***He died at last, and fully wise, he passed away to heaven.”*";
P_HTM[3762]="***When the Teacher had ended this discourse of Vessantara, with its thousand verses, he identified the Jātaka, “At that time, Devadatta was Jūjaka, the lady Ciñcā was Amitatāpanī, Channa was Cetaputta, Sāriputta was the ascetic Accuta, Anuruddha was Sakka, king Suddhodana was king Sañjaya, Mahāmāyā was Phusatī, Rāhula’s mother was queen Maddī, Rāhula was prince Jāli, Uppalavaṇṇā was Kaṇhājinā, the followers of Buddha were the rest of the people, and king Vessantara was I myself.”*";
