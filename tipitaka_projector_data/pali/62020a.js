P_HTM[8]="***If with thought corrupt a man speak or act,*";
P_HTM[9]="***Suffering follows him, even as a wheel follows the hoof of the beast of burden.*";
P_HTM[10]="***Where was this religious instruction given? At Sāvatthi. With reference to whom? Cakkhupāla the Elder.*";
P_HTM[11]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, lived a householder named Great-Wealth, Mahā-Suvaṇṇa. He was rich, possessed of great wealth, possessed of ample means of enjoyment, but at the same time he was childless. One day, as he was on his way home from bathing at a ghat, he saw by the roadside a large forest tree with spreading branches. Thought he, “This tree must be tenanted by a powerful tree-spirit.” So he caused the ground under the tree to be cleared, the tree itself to be inclosed with a wall, and sand to be spread within the inclosure. And having decked the tree with flags and banners, he made the following vow: “Should I obtain a son or a daughter, I will pay you great honor.” Having so done, he went on his way.*";
P_HTM[12]="***Now in no long time his wife conceived a child in her womb. So soon as his wife knew that she was with child, she informed her husband, and he performed the Protection of the Embryo for her. On the expiration of ten lunar months she gave birth to a son. Since the merchant obtained a son by protecting the tree, he named his son Protector, Pāla. After a time he obtained a second son. The younger son he named Protector junior, Culla Pāla, calling the older Protector senior, Mahā Pāla. When they reached manhood, their parents obtained wives for them. After a time the mother and father died, leaving the entire estate to be administered by the two sons.*";
P_HTM[13]="***At this time the Teacher, having set in motion the glorious Wheel of the Law, after journeying from place to place, took up his residence at Jetavana, a monastery erected by the wealthy merchant Anāthapiṇḍika at a cost of fifty-four crores of treasure. While in residence at Jetavana, he established the multitude in the Way to Heaven and the Way to Deliverance. (For the Tathāgata kept residence during but a single rainy season at the monastery erected by twice eighty thousand families of kinsmen, eighty on his mother’s side, eighty on his father’s. At Jetavana monastery, erected by Anāthapiṇḍika, he kept residence during nineteen rainy seasons; at Pubbārāma, erected by Visākhā at a cost of twenty-seven crores, he kept residence during six rainy seasons. Thus, by reason of the great merit of these two families, he kept residence near Sāvatthi during twenty-five rainy seasons.)*";
P_HTM[14]="***Anāthapiṇḍika and Visākhā, the eminent female lay disciple, went regularly twice every day to wait upon the Tathāgata. Knowing that the young novices would expect alms from them, they never went empty-handed. Before breakfast they took food, both hard and soft; after breakfast they took the five medicaments and the eight beverages. Moreover, in their residences seats were always prepared for two thousand monks. Whoever wished food or drink or medicine was immediately provided with just what he wished.*";
P_HTM[15]="***Not a single day had Anāthapiṇḍika asked the Teacher a question. Anāthapiṇḍika, we are told, refrained from asking questions by reason of his excessive love for the Teacher. He thought to himself, “The Tathāgata is a delicate Buddha, a delicate prince. Were the Teacher, because of the thought, ‘This householder is my supporter,’ to preach the Law to me, he would grow weary.” Therefore he asked the Teacher no questions. But so soon as Anāthapiṇḍika took his seat, the Teacher thought to himself, “This merchant protects me where I have no need to be protected. For I spent four Incalculables and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition fulfilling the Perfections. My own gloriously adorned head have I cut off; my eyes have I torn out; my heart’s flesh have I uprooted; both son and wife, dear to me as life, have I renounced, solely that I might preach the Law to others. This man protects me where I have no need to be protected.” And straightway he preached a sermon on the Law.*";
P_HTM[16]="***At this time seventy million people dwelt in Sāvatthi. Of these, fifty million became Noble Disciples after hearing the discourse of the Teacher, but twenty million remained unconverted. The Noble Disciples had two duties: before breakfast they gave alms; after breakfast, bearing perfumes and garlands in their hands, with servants bearing garments, medicaments, and beverages, they went to hear the Law.*";
P_HTM[17]="***Now one day Mahā Pāla saw the Noble Disciples going to the monastery with perfumes and garlands in their hands. When he saw them, he asked, “Where is this great throng going?” “To hear the Law.” “I will go too,” said he. So he went, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down in the outer circle of the congregation.*";
P_HTM[18]="***Now when the Buddhas preach the Law, they have regard to the predispositions of their hearers for the Refuges, the Moral Precepts, and Retirement from the World. Thus they always preach the Law with reference to the disposition of mind of each individual. When, therefore, the Teacher preached the Law on that day, he had regard to Mahā Pāla’s predispositions. And he preached in orderly sequence, expounding one subject after another; to wit, Almsgiving, the Moral Precepts, Heaven, the evil consequences and folly and defilement of Sensual Pleasures, and the blessings of Retirement from the World.*";
P_HTM[19]="***Mahā Pāla the householder listened. Thought he, “When a man goes to the next world, neither sons nor daughters nor riches follow him; nay, even his own body goes not with him. Of what profit is it for me to live the house-life? I will become a monk.” So at the end of the discourse he approached the Teacher and asked to be received into the Order. The Teacher asked him, “Have you no kinsman of whom it is proper that you should ask leave?” “Why yes, Reverend Sir, I have a younger brother.” “Well then, ask him.” To this Mahā Pāla agreed, and said, “Very well.” So he paid obeisance to the Teacher and went home. Summoning his younger brother, he said to him,*";
P_HTM[20]="***“Dear brother, whatever wealth is in this house, whether animate or inanimate, all this I give into your hands; take possession thereof.” “But you, master?” “I shall enter the Order under the Teacher.” “What say you, dear brother? When my mother died, I gained in you as it were a mother; when my father died, as it were a father. Your house contains great wealth. Surely you can do works of merit even though you live the house-life. Do not so.” “Dear brother, after hearing the Teacher preach the Law, I can no longer live the life of a householder. For the Teacher preached a Law lovely in its beginning, its middle, and its end, and established precisely and exactly the Three Characteristics of existing things: Impermanence, Suffering, and Absence of Individuality. I cannot fulfill the Law amid the cares of the household life; I must enter the Order, dear brother.” “Dear brother, now you are young. Wait until you are old, and then enter the Order.” “Dear brother, in the case of an old man, even hands and feet are disobedient and answer not to his will; how much more so his kinsmen? No, I will not do as you say; I will fulfill the duties of a monk.*";
P_HTM[21]="***Hands and feet weakened by old age are disobedient;*";
P_HTM[22]="***How shall he whose strength is impaired fulfill the Law?*";
P_HTM[23]="***Dear brother, I shall enter the Order despite all considerations to the contrary.”*";
P_HTM[24]="***In spite of his brother’s lamentations Mahā Pāla went to the Teacher and asked to be admitted to the Order. He was admitted and professed and spent five rainy seasons in residence with teachers and preceptors. When he had completed his fifth residence and celebrated the terminal festival, he approached the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and asked, “Reverend Sir, how many Duties are there in this religion?” “Two Duties only, monk: the Duty of Study and the Duty of Contemplation.” “Reverend Sir, what is meant by the Duty of Study, and what is meant by the Duty of Contemplation?” “The Duty of Study necessitates gaining a knowledge of the Word of the Buddha in a manner conformable to one’s understanding, the mastery of one or two Nikāyas, or indeed of the whole Tipiṭaka, bearing it in mind, reciting it, teaching it. On the other hand the Duty of Contemplation, which leads to Arahatship, involves frugal living, satisfaction with a remote lodging, fixing firmly in one’s mind the idea of decay and death, and the development of Spiritual Insight by persistent effort.” “Reverend Sir, since I became a monk in old age, I shall not be able to fulfill the Duty of Study. But I can fulfill the Duty of Contemplation; teach me a Formula of Meditation.”*";
P_HTM[25]="***So the Teacher taught him a Formula of Meditation leading to Arahatship. Then he paid obeisance to the Teacher, sought monks to accompany him, and having obtained sixty, departed with them. When he had proceeded a distance of twenty leagues, he arrived at a larger border-village, and accompanied by his retinue, entered the village for alms. The inhabitants, observing that the monks were faithful in the performance of their duties, were favorably disposed to them, provided them with seats, and served them with savory food. Then they inquired, “Reverend Sirs, whither go the noble monks?” “Lay brethren, to a suitable retreat.” Then the wise villagers knew within themselves, “The reverend monks seek lodgings wherein to spend the rainy season.”*";
P_HTM[26]="***Said they, “If the noble monks would reside here during these three months, we would abide steadfast in the Refuges and receive the Moral Precepts.” The monks, thinking to themselves, “Through these families we shall effect escape from the round of existences,” gave their consent. The villagers, having obtained the consent of the monks, proceeded to erect a monastery, building night-quarters and day-quarters, and when it was finished, presented it to the monks. The monks resorted regularly to that village only for alms. And a certain physician came to them and offered his services, saying, “Reverend Sirs, where many reside, disease is inevitable. Should sickness arise, pray send me word, and I will prescribe remedies for you.”*";
P_HTM[27]="***When the monks entered upon residence on the first day of the rainy season, the Elder, addressing them, asked this question, “Brethren, in how many Postures will you spend these three months?” “In all Four Postures, Reverend Sir.” “But, brethren, is this proper? Assuredly we must be heedful, for it was from the living Buddha that we received our Formula of Meditation on coming hither; and the favor of the Buddhas may not be won by double-dealing, but only by the manifestation of upright intent. Four States of Suffering await whoso is heedless, that he may enter therein as into his own habitation. Therefore, brethren, be heedful.” “But you, Reverend Sir?” “I shall spend the time in the Three Postures; I shall not stretch out my back, brethren.” “Very well, Reverend Sir. Be heedful.”*";
P_HTM[28]="***At the end of the first month the Elder, who allowed himself no sleep, began to suffer from an affection of the eyes. Streams of tears trickled from his eyes, as streams of water from a broken jar. All night long he devoted himself to meditation, and with the coming of dawn entered his cell and sat down. When it was time for the monks to go the rounds for alms, they came to the Elder and said to him, “Reverend Sir, it is time for us to go the rounds for alms.” “Very well, brethren; take bowl and robe.” Having thus directed them to take their own bowls and robes, he himself set out. The monks observed that his eyes were running and asked him, “What is the matter, Reverend Sir?” “The wind cuts my eyes, brethren.” “Were we not offered the services of a physician, Reverend Sir? We will inform him.” “Very well, brethren.”*";
P_HTM[29]="***They informed the physician, who prepared an ointment and sent it to the Elder. The Elder applied the ointment to his nose, remaining seated as he did so, and then entered the village. The physician, seeing him, said to him, “Reverend Sir, I am informed that the wind hurts your reverence’s eyes.” “That is true, lay disciple.” “Reverend Sir, did you apply to your nose an ointment which I prepared and sent you?” “Yes, lay disciple.” “How do you feel now?” “The pain continues just the same, lay disciple.” The physician thought to himself, “The ointment which I sent him should have cured him with only one application. How is it that he is not cured?” So he asked the Elder, “Were you seated when you applied the ointment, or were you lying down?” The Elder remained silent. Though the physician repeated the question several times, he answered not a word. The physician thought to himself, “I will go to the monastery and have a look at his cell.” So he dismissed the Elder, saying to him, “That will do, Reverend Sir.” And going to the monastery, he inspected the Elder’s cell. Seeing only a place to walk and a place to sit down, but no place to lie down, he asked the Elder, “Reverend Sir, were you seated when you applied the ointment, or were you lying down?” The Elder remained silent. “Reverend Sir, do not act in this way; the duties of a religious can be performed only so long as the body is properly cared for. Were you lying down when you applied the ointment?” After the physician had repeated the question several times, the Elder replied, “Go your way, brother; I will take counsel and decide the matter for myself.”*";
P_HTM[30]="***Now the Elder had no kinsmen or blood-relatives there. With whom, therefore, was he to take counsel? Therefore he took counsel with his own person, saying, “Come now, brother Pālita, tell me this. Will you regard your eyes or the Religion of the Buddha? For in the round of existences without conceivable beginning, there is no counting the number of times you have been without eyes. But while unnumbered hundreds of Buddhas and thousands of Buddhas have passed, your experience does not cover the period of even a single Buddha. Now in this rainy season you resolved not to lie down for three months. Therefore let your eyes perish or decay. Keep only the Law of the Buddha, not your eyes.” And admonishing his own physical body, he uttered the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[31]="***My eyes perish, my ears perish, so also my body,*";
P_HTM[32]="***All that has to do with my body perishes;*";
P_HTM[33]="***Why, Pālita, continue heedless?*";
P_HTM[34]="***My eyes wear out, my ears wear out, so also my body,*";
P_HTM[35]="***All that has to do with my body wears out;*";
P_HTM[36]="***Why, Pālita, continue heedless?*";
P_HTM[37]="***My eyes decay, my ears decay, so also my body,*";
P_HTM[38]="***All that has to do with my body decays;*";
P_HTM[39]="***Why, Pālita, continue heedless?*";
P_HTM[40]="***Having thus admonished himself in three Stanzas, he applied the ointment to his nose, remaining seated as before, and then entered the village for alms. The physician, seeing him, asked him, “Reverend Sir, have you applied the ointment to your nose?” “Yes, lay disciple.” “How do you feel?” “The pain continues just the same, lay disciple.” “Reverend Sir, were you seated when you applied the ointment, or were you lying down?” The Elder remained silent. The physician repeated the question several times, but the Elder answered never a word. Then the physician said to him, “You are not doing as you ought for your own good. Henceforth do not say, ‘So and So prepared ointment for me’ and I will not say, ‘I prepared ointment for you.’ ”*";
P_HTM[41]="***Given up by the physician, the Elder went to the monastery. Said he, “Monk, though you have been given up by the physician, do not give up your Posture.”*";
P_HTM[42]="***You are given up as incurable, you are abandoned by your physician.*";
P_HTM[43]="***Destined to the King of Death, why, Pālita, are you heedless?*";
P_HTM[44]="***Having admonished himself in this Stanza, he resumed his meditations. At the end of the middle watch his eyes and his Depravities were blotted out simultaneously, and he became an Arahat dwelling in the bliss of Spiritual Insight. He entered his cell and sat down. When the time came for the monks to go the rounds for alms, they came to the Elder and said to him, “Reverend Sir, it is time for us to go the rounds for alms.” “Is it time, brethren?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Well then, go your way.” “But you, Reverend Sir?” “The sight of my eyes is gone, brethren.” They looked at his eyes, and their own eyes filled with tears. “Do not worry, Reverend Sir; we will look after you,” said they to the Elder, comforting him. And having performed the various duties required of them, they entered the village for alms.*";
P_HTM[45]="***Not seeing the Elder, people asked the monks, “Brethren, where is our noble Elder?” When they learned what had happened, they sent rice-porridge to him. Afterwards, taking food, they went in person, paid obeisance to the Elder, and rolling on the ground before his feet, poured out their lamentations. Then they comforted him, saying, “We will care for you, Reverend Sir; do not worry,” and went their way. From that time on they sent rice-porridge regularly to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[46]="***The Elder constantly admonished the other sixty monks, and they carried out his admonitions so faithfully that at the next Pavāraṇā all of them became Arahats possessed of the Supernatural Faculties. At the end of the rainy season, desiring to see the Teacher, they said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, we desire to see the Teacher.” When the Elder heard their request, he thought to himself, “I am weak, and on the way is a forest haunted by evil spirits. If I go with them, all will become weary and will be unable to obtain alms. I will send them on ahead.”*";
P_HTM[47]="***So he said to them, “Brethren, you go on ahead.” “But you, Reverend Sir?” “I am weak, and on the way is a forest haunted by evil spirits. If I go with you, you will all become weary; therefore you go on ahead.” “Do not so, Reverend Sir; we will go only with you.” “Brethren, please do not do so; if you do so, it will displease me. When my younger brother sees you and asks after me, tell him that I have lost the sight of my eyes, and he will send someone to guide my steps. Greet in my name the Possessor of the Ten Forces and the eighty Chief Elders.” So saying, he dismissed them.*";
P_HTM[48]="***They begged the Elder to pardon them for their insistence, and entered the village for alms. The villagers provided them with seats, presented them with alms, and asked them, “Reverend Sirs, may we know why the noble monks are leaving?” “Yes, lay disciples, we desire to see the Teacher.” The villagers repeatedly begged the monks to remain, but finding that they were firm in their determination to go, accompanied them on their way weeping, and then turned back.*";
P_HTM[49]="***After journeying from place to place, the monks arrived at Jetavana and greeted the Teacher and the eighty Chief Elders in the name of the Elder. Having so done, they entered for alms the street where lived the Elder’s younger brother. The householder recognized them, received them cordially, provided them with seats, and asked them, “Where is my dear brother the Elder?’ ” They told him what had happened. Flinging himself at their feet, he rolled on the ground and wept.*";
P_HTM[50]="***Then he asked them, “Now, brethren, what is to be done?” “The Elder wishes to have someone come from here, that he may return with him.” “Brethren, here is my sister’s son Pālita. Send him.” “It will never do to send him, for there is danger by the way. We might, however, send him, after first receiving him into the Order.” “Do so and send him, brethren.” So they received him into the Order and for a fortnight instructed him in such matters as the proper manner of putting on the robe. Then, showing him the way, they sent him forth.*";
P_HTM[51]="***After journeying from place to place, he arrived at the village. Seeing an old man at the village gate, he asked him, “Is there a forest hermitage near this village?” “There is, Reverend Sir.” “Who lives there?” “An Elder named Pālita, Reverend Sir.” “Show me the way there.” “Who are you, Reverend Sir?” “I am the son of the Elder’s sister.” So the old man took him and led him to the hermitage. He paid obeisance to the Elder and for a fortnight performed the major and minor duties for him, ministering to him faithfully. Then he said to him, “Reverend Sir, the householder my mother’s brother desires to have you come to him. Let us go thither.” “Very well, take hold of my staff.” Taking hold of the staff by the tip, he entered the village with the Elder. The villagers provided the Elder with a seat and asked him, “Reverend Sir, may we know your purpose in going?” “Yes, lay disciples, I am going to pay my respects to the Teacher.” The villagers sought by all means in their power to persuade them to remain, but failing in their efforts, escorted them part of the way, and then turned back weeping.*";
P_HTM[52]="***When the novice had gone part of the way with the Elder, holding the tip of the Elder’s staff, he arrived at a forest village named Kaṭṭhanagara, near which the Elder formerly resided. As the novice came out of the village, he heard in the forest the voice of a woman singing away as she gathered firewood. As he listened to her song, he fell in love with her voice. (There is no sound to be compared with a woman’s voice for power to thrill man’s whole frame. Therefore said the Exalted One, “Monks, I know of no other single sound which so completely takes possession of the heart of a man as this, monks; namely, a woman’s voice.”)*";
P_HTM[53]="***The novice, fascinated by her voice, let go his hold of the Elder’s staff. Said he, “Wait just a moment, Reverend Sir; I have some business.” So saying, he went in the direction of the woman. When she saw him, she became silent. The novice violated the law of chastity with her. The Elder thought to himself, “Just now I heard the sound of someone singing, and it was none other than a woman’s voice. The novice tarries; he must have violated the law of chastity.” When the novice had finished his business, he returned to the Elder and said, “Come, Reverend Sir, let us be off.” But the Elder asked him, “Novice, have you committed sin?” The novice remained silent, and though questioned repeatedly, answered never a word. Then said the Elder to him, “A sinner like you can never hold the tip of my staff.”*";
P_HTM[54]="***The novice, overwhelmed with remorse, removed his yellow robes, clothed himself in the garb of a householder, and said, “Reverend Sir, before I was a novice; now I have become a layman again. It was not through faith that I became a monk, but because I feared the dangers of the journey. Come, let us be off.” The Elder replied, “An evildoer is an evildoer, be he layman or be he novice. While you were a novice, you were unable to keep the law of chastity. Will you be a better man for having become a layman? A sinner like you can never hold the tip of my staff.” “Reverend Sir, the road is infested with evil spirits and you are blind. How can you remain here?” The Elder answered, “Brother, don’t worry about that. No matter whether I lie down right here and die, or wander hither and thither, with you I will never go.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[55]="***Alas! I have lost the sight of my eyes; a weary way have I come;*";
P_HTM[56]="***I will lie down and go no farther; with a simpleton no fellowship may be.*";
P_HTM[57]="***Alas! I have lost the sight of my eyes; a weary way have I come;*";
P_HTM[58]="***I shall die; I will go no farther; with a simpleton no fellowship may be.*";
P_HTM[59]="***When the novice heard this, he was overwhelmed with remorse. And he cried out, “A grievous sin indeed have I committed, a deed of violence and impropriety!” And wringing his hands and weeping, he plunged into the forest and made off.*";
P_HTM[60]="***By the power of the Elder’s virtue the Yellowstone Throne of Sakka king of gods, sixty leagues long, fifty leagues wide, fifteen leagues thick, of the color of the Jayasumana flower, which has a way of lowering itself when Sakka sits down and of rising again when he stands up, manifested signs of heat. “Who, pray, can be seeking to thrust me from my seat?” thought Sakka. Surveying the world with Supernatural Vision, he saw the Elder. Therefore said those of old time,*";
P_HTM[61]="***The king of gods, possessing a thousand eyes, purified the Divine Eye;*";
P_HTM[62]="***This sin-abhorring Pāla purified his life.*";
P_HTM[63]="***The king of the gods, possessing a thousand eyes, purified the Divine Eye;*";
P_HTM[64]="***This Pāla, reverer of the Law, sat delighting in Religion.*";
P_HTM[65]="***Then this thought occurred to him, “Should I fail to go to the assistance of such a sin-abhorring, Law-revering Elder, my head is likely to split into seven pieces. I will go to him.” And so*";
P_HTM[66]="***The king of the gods, possessed of a thousand eyes, bearing majestic sway over the gods,*";
P_HTM[67]="***In a single instant approaching, approached Cakkhupāla.*";
P_HTM[68]="***Accordingly Sakka approached the Elder. When he was quite near him, he shuffled his feet. “Who is there?” asked the Elder. “It is I, Reverend Sir, a traveler.” “Where are you going, lay disciple?” “To Sāvatthi, Reverend Sir.” “Continue your journey, brother.” “But, Reverend Sir, where is your reverence going?” “I am going there too.” “Well then, let us go together, Reverend Sir.” “I am weak, brother. If you go with me, you will be delayed.” “I have no urgent business. Besides, if I go with you, I can avail myself of one of the ten ways and means of acquiring merit. Let us go together, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[69]="***The Elder thought to himself, “This is without doubt some pious man.” So he said to him, “Very well, take hold of the tip of my staff, lay brother.” Sakka did so. And Sakka shortened the distance so that they arrived at Jetavana at eventide. The Elder, hearing the noise of trumpets, drums, and other instruments of music, asked, “Where is that noise?” “At Sāvatthi, Reverend Sir.” “Lay brother, when I came here before, we were a long time in coming.” “I know a short cut, Reverend Sir.” At that moment the Elder perceived within himself, “This is no human being; it must be a divinity.”*";
P_HTM[70]="***The king of gods, possessing a thousand eyes, bearing majestic sway over the gods,*";
P_HTM[71]="***Shortening the distance, came quickly to Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[72]="***Sakka conducted the Elder to a hut of leaves and grass which his younger brother had made for his express use, seated him on a couch, and then, disguising himself as a dear friend of the younger brother, went to summon him. “Friend Pāla!” he called out. “What is it, friend?” “Do you know that the Elder has arrived?” “No; is it true that the Elder has arrived?” “Yes, friend, I have just returned from the hermitage, and saw the Elder seated in the hut of leaves and grass you built for him.” So saying, he departed.*";
P_HTM[73]="***The householder went to the hermitage. When he saw the Elder, he flung himself at his feet, rolled on the ground, and wept. Then he said, “I knew this would happen, Reverend Sir. It was for this reason that I withheld from you my permission to become a monk.” After talking with him for some time, he freed two slave-boys, had the Elder receive them into the Order, and committed him to their care, saying, “Bring rice-porridge and other kinds of food from the village and minister to the Elder.” The novices ministered to the Elder, performing the major and minor duties faithfully.*";
P_HTM[74]="***Now one day a party of monks residing in foreign parts came to Jetavana to see the Teacher, After paying their respects to the Teacher and seeing the eighty Chief Elders, they made the rounds of the monastery. Coming to Cakkhupāla’s retreat, they said to each other, “Let us see him too.” So when evening came, they set out to visit him. Just at that moment a severe storm arose. So they turned back, saying, “It is now evening, and a storm has arisen. Therefore we will go and see him in the morning.” The rain continued during the first watch, but ceased in the second. The Elder, a man of great energy, accustomed to walking, came down into the cloister in the last watch. Now at that time many insects had come out of the newly wet earth, and as the Elder walked up and down, they perished in great numbers. The resident monks did not sweep betimes where the Elder walked. When the visiting monks arrived, saying, “We would see the place where the Elder resides,” and saw the insects in the cloister, they asked, “Who was it that walked in this cloister?” “Our master. Reverend Sirs.” They were offended and said, “See what the monk has done. When he had the sight of his eyes, he lay down and slept and did no sin. But now that he has lost his eyesight, saying to himself, ‘I will take a walk,’ he has destroyed these insects. ‘That which is right I will do,’ said he; but that which was not right he has done.” So they went and reported the matter to the Tathāgata, saying, “Reverend Sir, the Elder Cakkhupāla, saying to himself, ‘I will take a walk,’ has destroyed many insects.” “But did you see him killing them?” “We did not, Reverend Sir.” “Precisely as you did not see him, so also did he not see these insects. Monks, they that are freed from the Depravities have no thought of killing.” “Reverend Sir, seeing that he was destined to become an Arahat, how was it that he became blind?” “Monks, it was by reason of his misdeed in a former existence.” “Why, Reverend Sir, what did he do?” “Well then, monks, listen.”*";
P_HTM[75]="***1 a. Story of the Past: The wicked physician and the woman*";
P_HTM[76]="***In times long past, when the king of Kāsi reigned at Benāres, a certain physician went through towns and villages practicing his profession. Seeing a certain woman with weak eyes, he asked her, “What is the matter with you?” “My eyesight has failed.” “I will prescribe for you.” “Do so, master.” “What will you give me?” “If you succeed in making my eyes well and strong again, I will become your slave, and my sons and daughters too.” “Very well,” said he. So he prescribed a remedy for her, and with a single application of the remedy her eyes became well and strong again.*";
P_HTM[77]="***Upon this she thought, “I promised to become his slave, and my sons and daughters too. But he will not treat me kindly. Therefore I will deceive him.” So when the physician came and asked her how she was getting on, she answered, “Before, my eyes pained me a little; but now they hurt me worse than ever.” The physician thought, “This woman is deceiving me because she is unwilling to give me anything. I don’t want her fee; now I will make her blind.” So he went home and told his wife about the matter. His wife said nothing. Then he compounded an ointment, went to the woman’s house, and directed her to rub it into her eyes. She did so, and her eyes went out like the flame of a lamp. That physician was Cakkhupāla. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[78]="***“Monks, the evil deed then committed by my son followed him ever after; for an evil deed follows the evildoer even as a wheel follows the hoof of the ox that bears the yoke.” After relating this story, the King of Righteousness joined the connection, even as a king seals an edict with the royal seal after the clay has been affixed, and pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[79]="***1. Thought is of all things first, thought is of all things foremost, of thought are all things made.*";
P_HTM[80]="***If with thought corrupt a man speak or act.*";
P_HTM[81]="***Suffering follows him, even as a wheel follows the hoof of the beast of burden.*";
P_HTM[82]="*[2] 2. Maṭṭhakuṇḍalīvatthu**2. Why Cry for the Moon?*";
P_HTM[83]="***2. Thought is of all things first, thought is of all things foremost, of thought are all things made.*";
P_HTM[84]="***If with thought of faith a man speak or act,*";
P_HTM[85]="***Happiness follows him, even as a shadow never fading.*";
P_HTM[86]="***The Second Stanza also, beginning with the words, “Thought is of all things first,” was recited in the same city, Sāvatthi, with reference to Maṭṭhakuṇḍali.*";
P_HTM[87]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, lived a Brahman named Never-Gave, Adinnapubbaka. He never gave anything to anybody, and that is why they called him Never-Gave, Adinnapubbaka. He had an only son who was his darling and delight. Now he desired to have a set of ornaments made for him. But knowing that in case he gave the commission to a goldsmith, he should have to pay him a fee, he beat out the gold himself, made him a pair of burnished earrings, and gave them to him. In this way his son received the name Burnished-Earrings, Maṭṭhakuṇḍali.*";
P_HTM[88]="***When his son was sixteen years old, he had an attack of jaundice. The mother looked at the boy and said, “Brahman, your son is sick; have him treated by a physician.” “Wife, if I send for a physician, I shall have to pay him a fee in rice; you care nothing about the loss of my substance.” “Well, Brahman, what are you going to do about it?” “I shall manage things in such a way as to lose none of my wealth.” So he went to various physicians and asked, “What are you in the habit of prescribing for such and such an ailment?” They mentioned to him bark of trees and this or that.*";
P_HTM[89]="***So he procured these and prepared a remedy for his son. But in spite of all he did, his son’s condition grew worse and worse, until finally he was past help. The Brahman, perceiving that his son was very weak, sent for a physician. The physician looked at the youth and said, “I have important business to attend to; send for some other physician and have him treat him.” Having thus refused to treat the boy, he turned and left the house. The Brahman realized that his son was at the point of death. Thought he, “All who come to see this youth will see the wealth in my house; therefore I will place him outside.” So he carried his son out of the house and laid him down on the terrace.*";
P_HTM[90]="***On that day, very early in the morning, the Exalted One arose from a Trance of Great Compassion. And for the purpose of seeing those who had made their Earnest Wish under previous Buddhas, those the roots of whose merit were fully developed, brethren capable of conversion, he surveyed the universe with the Eye of a Buddha, spreading the Net of his Knowledge over the ten Cakkavāḷa Worlds. Straightway Maṭṭhakuṇḍali, lying outside on the terrace, appeared within the Net of his Knowledge. As soon as the Teacher saw him, he became aware that he had been removed from the house and laid there; and considering within himself, “Have I sufficient reason for going to him?” he saw the following:*";
P_HTM[91]="***“This youth will repose faith in me, will die, and will be reborn as a deity in the Heaven of the Thirty-three, in a golden mansion, with a retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs. The Brahman will burn his body and will go about the burning-ground weeping. The deity will survey his own person, three-quarters of a league in height, adorned with sixty cart-loads of ornaments, surrounded by a thousand celestial nymphs. And considering within himself, ‘Through what merit have I attained this attainment of splendor?’ he will perceive that he obtained it by reposing faith in me. Then he will say to himself, ‘My father, who failed to provide medicine for me for fear of wasting his wealth, has now gone to the burning-ground and is weeping. I will effect a change in his attitude.’ And provoked at his father, he will take the form of Maṭṭhakuṇḍali, will go to a place not far from the burning-ground, and will fling himself on the ground and weep.*";
P_HTM[92]="***“The Brahman will ask him, ‘Who are you?’ He will reply, ‘I am your son Maṭṭhakuṇḍali.’ ‘Where were you reborn?’ ‘In the World of the Thirty-three.’ The Brahman will ask him, ‘What deed of merit did you perform?’ and Maṭṭhakuṇḍali will tell him that he was reborn in the World of the Thirty-three by reposing faith in me. Then the Brahman will ask me, ‘Are there any that have been reborn in Heaven by reposing faith in you?’ and I will reply to him, ‘It is not so many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands–there is no counting the number of them.’ I will then recite a Stanza in the Dhammapada. At the conclusion of the Stanza eighty-four thousand living beings will obtain Comprehension of the Law, Maṭṭhakuṇḍali will receive the Fruit of Conversion, and so will Adinnapubbaka the Brahman. Thus through this noble youth many will obtain Comprehension of the Law.”*";
P_HTM[93]="***Of all this the Teacher became aware. Accordingly, on the following day, having attended to his toilet, he surrounded himself with a large company of monks, entered Sāvatthi for alms, and in due course arrived at the house of the Brahman. At that moment Maṭṭhakuṇḍali was lying with face turned towards the house. The Teacher, observing that he did not see him, sent forth a ray of light. “What is that radiance?” asked the youth, turning over. Seeing the Teacher from where he lay, he said, “On account of a foolish father, I have been deprived of the privilege of approaching so excellent a Buddha, nor have I obtained the privilege either of waiting upon him or of giving him alms or of hearing the Law. Now I cannot even control the movements of my hands; there is nothing else I can do.” So saying, he reposed faith in the Buddha. The Teacher said, “He has done enough,” and departed.*";
P_HTM[94]="***As the Tathāgata receded from his range of vision, he died with a believing heart, and as if awaking from sleep, was reborn in the World of the Gods in a golden mansion thirty leagues in extent. The Brahman burned the body of his son, and resorting to the burning-ground, abandoned himself entirely to lamentation. Every day he would go to the burning-ground and weep and say, “Where are you, my only son.’ ”*";
P_HTM[95]="***The deity his former son surveyed his own glory and considered within himself, “By what deed of merit have I obtained this?” Perceiving that it was by reposing faith in the Teacher, he said to himself, “This Brahman failed to provide medicine for me when I was sick, but now goes to the burning-ground and weeps; I must effect a change in his attitude.” Accordingly he took the form of Maṭṭhakuṇḍali, went to a place not far from the burning-ground, and stood wringing his hands and weeping. The Brahman saw him and thought to himself, “As for myself, I am weeping because of sorrow for my son; why is yonder youth weeping.’ I will ask him.” So he asked him in the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[96]="***Richly adorned, wearing earrings of burnished gold.*";
P_HTM[97]="***Bearing garlands, with protuberances of yellow sandal.*";
P_HTM[98]="***You wring your hands and weep.*";
P_HTM[99]="***Why are you afflicted in the midst of the forest?*";
P_HTM[100]="***Said the youth,*";
P_HTM[101]="***I have obtained a chariot-body.*";
P_HTM[102]="***Shining, of solid gold,*";
P_HTM[103]="***But I cannot find a pair of wheels for it;*";
P_HTM[104]="***Through grief over this I shall lose my life.*";
P_HTM[105]="***Then said the Brahman to him,*";
P_HTM[106]="***Name wheels of gold, of precious stones,*";
P_HTM[107]="***Of copper, or of silver.*";
P_HTM[108]="***Name them to me, good youth,*";
P_HTM[109]="***And I will procure you a pair of wheels.*";
P_HTM[110]="***Hearing this, the youth thought to himself, “This Brahman failed to provide medicine for his son. But seeing that I look like his son, he says, ‘I will procure wheels for your chariot, either of gold or of precious stones or of copper or of silver.’ Very well! I will humble him.” So he said, “How large a pair of wheels will you make for my chariot?” “As large as you wish.” “I want the moon and the sun,” said the youth. “Give them to me.” By way of request*";
P_HTM[111]="***Said the youth to the Brahman, the moon and the sun are brothers twain.*";
P_HTM[112]="***My chariot is of solid gold; with such a pair of wheels it would shine.*";
P_HTM[113]="***The Brahman replied.*";
P_HTM[114]="***Youth, you are a simpleton to seek for what cannot be obtained.*";
P_HTM[115]="***I suppose you will die, for you will never obtain the moon and the sun.*";
P_HTM[116]="***But the youth said to him, “But which is the greater simpleton, he who weeps for what exists, or he who weeps for what does not exist?”*";
P_HTM[117]="***They are seen that go and come;*";
P_HTM[118]="***The property of color is seen on both sides of the street;*";
P_HTM[119]="***But he that is dead and gone cannot be seen;*";
P_HTM[120]="***Which of us that weep here is the greater simpleton?*";
P_HTM[121]="***Hearing this, the Brahman came to the conclusion, “What this youth says is sensible.” And he said to him.*";
P_HTM[122]="***Youth, what you say is quite true; it is I that am the greater simpleton of the two that weep;*";
P_HTM[123]="***Like a child crying for the moon, I desired a son that is dead and gone.*";
P_HTM[124]="***Having thus spoken, freed from sorrow by the words of the youth, the Brahman pronounced the following Stanzas in praise of the youth.*";
P_HTM[125]="***When I was all on fire, and the fire was as if fed with ghee,*";
P_HTM[126]="***You poured water on the fire, as it were, and extinguished all my grief.*";
P_HTM[127]="***You drew out the arrow that was in me, the sorrow that was in my heart;*";
P_HTM[128]="***Although I was dead with sorrow, you removed my sorrow for my son.*";
P_HTM[129]="***The arrow of my grief has been withdrawn, and I am tranquil and happy;*";
P_HTM[130]="***Having heard your words, youth, I sorrow no more, nor do I weep.*";
P_HTM[131]="***Then the Brahman asked him, “Who are you?”*";
P_HTM[132]="***Are you a devatā or a gandhabba, or are you Sakka Purindada?*";
P_HTM[133]="***Who are you? whose son are you? how am I to know you?*";
P_HTM[134]="***The youth replied,*";
P_HTM[135]="***I am he for whom you lament, he for whom you weep.*";
P_HTM[136]="***Your son, whom you yourself burned in the burning-ground.*";
P_HTM[137]="***By the performance of a work of merit*";
P_HTM[138]="***I have attained the Society of the Thirty.*";
P_HTM[139]="***In these words the youth gave him the information he asked for. Then said the Brahman,*";
P_HTM[140]="***I never saw you give alms, either little or much, in your own home.*";
P_HTM[141]="***Nor did you so much as keep fast-day; by what work of merit did you attain the World of the Gods?*";
P_HTM[142]="***The youth replied,*";
P_HTM[143]="***As I lay in my own home, sick, afflicted, oppressed with a grievous ailment, my body weakened by disease,*";
P_HTM[144]="***I beheld the Buddha, free from passion, free from doubt, happy, of lofty wisdom.*";
P_HTM[145]="***With joyful mind and believing heart I did homage to the Tathāgata, with hands reverently clasped;*";
P_HTM[146]="***By the performance of this work of merit I attained the Society of the Thirty.*";
P_HTM[147]="***As the youth spoke, the whole body of the Brahman was suffused with joy. And this joy he made known in the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[148]="***Wonderful! marvelous! that such as this should be the fruit of a reverent salutation.*";
P_HTM[149]="***I too with joyful mind and believing heart seek refuge in the Buddha this very day.*";
P_HTM[150]="***Then said the youth,*";
P_HTM[151]="***This very day with believing heart seek refuge in the Buddha, the Law, and the Order;*";
P_HTM[152]="***Likewise take upon yourself the Five Precepts, and keep them unbroken and unimpaired;*";
P_HTM[153]="***Refrain from taking life, from this moment; take not that which is not given to you in this world;*";
P_HTM[154]="***Drink not strong drink; speak not falsely; be content with your own wife.*";
P_HTM[155]="***“Very well,” said the Brahman, agreeing. And he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[156]="***You desire my weal, yakkha; you desire my welfare, divinity;*";
P_HTM[157]="***I will obey your words; you are my teacher.*";
P_HTM[158]="***I seek refuge in the Buddha, and likewise in his incomparable Law,*";
P_HTM[159]="***And in the Order of the Prince of Men do I seek refuge.*";
P_HTM[160]="***From the taking of life do I refrain, from this moment; I abstain from taking that which is not given to me in this world;*";
P_HTM[161]="***I drink not strong drink; I speak not falsely; I am content with my own wife.*";
P_HTM[162]="***Then said the deity to him, “Brahman, you have much wealth in your house. Approach the Teacher, give alms, listen to the Law, and ask him questions.” So saying, he disappeared. The Brahman went home and said to his wife, “Wife, I shall invite the monk Gotama to my house and ask him questions; therefore prepare hospitality.” Then he went to the monastery, and without saluting the Teacher or expressing any pleasure at seeing him, stood on one side and said, “Sir Gotama, consent for to-day to take a meal in my house with your company of monks.” The Teacher consented. As soon as the Brahman received his consent, he returned home quickly and caused food, both hard and soft, to be prepared in his house.*";
P_HTM[163]="***The Teacher, accompanied by the Congregation of Monks, went to his house and sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Brahman waited upon him respectfully. A multitude of people assembled. We are told that when a man who holds false views invites the Tathāgata, two classes of people assemble. Those who hold false views assemble with the thought in their minds, “To-day we shall see the monk Gotama embarrassed by the questions that are asked him.” Those who hold orthodox views assemble with the thought, “To-day we shall see the power of a Buddha and the grace of a Buddha.”*";
P_HTM[164]="***Now when the Tathāgata had finished his meal, the Brahman approached him, seated himself on a low seat, and asked him the following question, “Sir Gotama, are there any that have been reborn in Heaven, without giving alms to you, without rendering honor to you, without hearing the Law, without keeping fast-day, solely by making an act of faith?” “Brahman, why do you ask me? Did not your own son Maṭṭhakuṇḍali tell you that he had been reborn in Heaven by reposing faith in me?” “When, Sir Gotama?” “Did you not go to the burning-ground to-day, and while you were weeping, see a youth near you wringing his hands and weeping? And did you not say to him, ‘Richly adorned, wearing earrings of burnished gold, bearing garlands, with protuberances of yellow sandal?’ ” Continuing, the Teacher related in detail the conversation of the two and told the whole story of Maṭṭhakuṇḍali.*";
P_HTM[165]="***For this very reason the Teacher pronounced this Word of the Buddha, “Brahman, it is not a question of one hundred or two hundred – there is no counting the number of those who have been reborn in Heaven by reposing faith in me.” The multitude were not free from doubt. The Teacher, perceiving that they were not free from doubt, commanded, “Let the deity Maṭṭhakuṇḍali come hither in his mansion.” Thereupon Maṭṭhakuṇḍali drew near, three-quarters of a league in height, his person adorned with celestial adornments. Descending from his mansion, he paid obeisance to the Teacher and stood respectfully on one side. The Teacher asked him, “What work of merit did you perform to attain this glory?”*";
P_HTM[166]="***Divinity, you who possess surpassing beauty,*";
P_HTM[167]="***Illuminating all four quarters like the herb-star,*";
P_HTM[168]="***I ask you, god of mighty power,*";
P_HTM[169]="***What meritorious act did you perform in your human estate?*";
P_HTM[170]="***When the Teacher had completed this Stanza, the deity replied, “Reverend Sir, I obtained this glory by reposing faith in you.” “You obtained it by reposing faith in me?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[171]="***The populace surveyed the god and exclaimed, “Marvelous, indeed, are the powers of the Buddhas! the son of the Brahman Adinnapubbaka obtained glory such as this simply by reposing faith in the Teacher, without doing a single other work of merit!” And they were filled with joy. Then the Teacher said to them, “Our thoughts are the source of all our actions, both good and bad, and by our thoughts are our actions controlled. For, like a shadow, an act done with thought of faith never leaves a man who goes to the World of the Gods or the world of men. Having related this story, the King of Truth joined the connection, and sealing, as it were, with the royal seal an edict to which the clay had been attached, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[172]="***2. Thought is of all things first, thought is of all things foremost, of thought are all things made.*";
P_HTM[173]="***If with thought of faith a man speak or act,*";
P_HTM[174]="***Happiness follows him, even as a shadow never fading.*";

P_HTM[179]="***If any cherish not this thought, their hatred ceases.*";
P_HTM[180]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder Tissa.*";
P_HTM[181]="***It seems that this Venerable Elder was the son of the sister of the father of the Exalted One. He was an old man when he retired from the world, and very fat. He enjoyed the gain and honor of the Buddhas; his clothes were always smooth from constant beating; he always sat in the center of the monastery in the Hall of State.*";
P_HTM[182]="***One day some visiting monks came to see the Tathāgata, and supposing Tissa to be some Great Elder, asked to be allowed the privilege of waiting upon him, offering among other things to rub his feet. Tissa remained silent. Thereupon a certain young monk asked him, “How many seasons have you kept residence?” “No seasons at all,” replied Tissa; “I was an old man when I retired from the world.” Said the young monk, “You wretched old monk, you overestimate your own importance. Seeing before you, as you do, all these Great Elders, you are not even civil to them. To their offers to perform various services for you, you answer by silence. Moreover, you show not the slightest regret for your misconduct.” So saying, he snapped his fingers. Recovering the pride of a member of the Warrior caste, Tissa asked them, “Whom did you come to see?” “We came to see the Teacher.” “But with reference to me, you say to yourselves, ‘Who is he?’ I will extirpate your whole race.” So saying, he went to the Teacher, weeping and sad and sorrowful.*";
P_HTM[183]="***The Teacher asked him, “Tissa, how is it that you come to me sad and sorrowful, with tears in your eyes, weeping?” The monks said to themselves, “If he goes alone, he may cause some trouble.” So they went right with him, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down respectfully on one side. Tissa answered the Teacher’s question as follows, “Reverend Sir, these monks are abusing me.” “But where were you sitting?” “In the center of the monastery in the Hall of State, Reverend Sir.” “Did you see these monks when they came?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, I saw them.” “Did you rise and go to meet them?” “No, Reverend Sir, I did not.” “Did you offer to take their monastic utensils?” “No, Reverend Sir, I did not offer to take them.”*";
P_HTM[184]="***“Did you offer to wait upon them and to provide them with water to drink?” “No, Reverend Sir, I did not offer to do either of these things.” “Did you bring seats for them and rub their feet?” “I did not, Reverend Sir,” “Tissa, you should have performed all these services for the old monks, for he who does not do this has no right to sit in the center of the monastery. You alone are to blame; ask pardon of these monks.” “But they abused me, Reverend Sir; I will not ask their pardon.” “Tissa, do not act thus. You alone are to blame; ask their pardon.” “I will not ask their pardon, Reverend Sir.” The monks said to the Teacher, “He is an obstinate monk, Reverend Sir.” The Teacher replied, “Monks, this is not the first time he has proved obstinate; he was obstinate also in a previous state of existence.” “We know all about his present obstinacy, Reverend Sir; but what did he do in a previous state of existence?” “Well then, monks, listen,” said the Teacher. So saying, he told the following*";
P_HTM[185]="***3 a. Story of the Past: Devala and Nārada*";
P_HTM[186]="***Once upon a time, when a certain king of Benāres reigned at Benāres, an ascetic named Devala, who had resided for eight months in the Himālaya country, desiring to reside near the city during the four months of the rains, returned from the Himālaya for salt and vinegar. Seeing two boys at the gate of the city, he asked them, “Where do monks who come to this city spend the night?” “In the potter’s hall, Reverend Sir.” So Devala went to the potter’s hall, stopped at the door, and said, “If it is agreeable to you, Bhaggava, I should like to spend one night in your hall.” The potter turned over the hall to him, saying, “I have no work going on in the hall at night, and the hall is a large one; spend the night here as you please, Reverend Sir,”*";
P_HTM[187]="***No sooner had Devala entered the hall and sat down than another ascetic named Nārada, returning from the Himālaya, asked the potter for a night’s lodging. The potter thought to himself, “The ascetic who arrived first may or may not be willing to spend the night with him; I will therefore relieve myself of responsibility.” So he said to the ascetic who had just arrived, “Reverend Sir, if the ascetic who arrived first approves, spend the night at his pleasure.” So Nārada approached Devala and said, “Teacher, if it is agreeable to you, I should like to spend one night here.” Devala replied, “The hall is a large one; therefore come in and spend the night on one side.” So Nārada went in and sat down behind the ascetic who had gone in before him. Both exchanged friendly greetings.*";
P_HTM[188]="***When it was bedtime, Nārada noted carefully the place where Devala lay and the position of the door, and then lay down. But when Devala lay down, instead of lying down in his proper place, he lay down directly across the doorway. The result was that when Nārada went out at night, he trod on Devala’s matted locks. Thereupon Devala cried out, “Who is treading on my locks?” Nārada replied, “Teacher, it is I.” “False ascetic,” said Devala, “you come from the forest and tread on my locks.” “Teacher, I did not know that you were lying here; pardon me.” Nārada then went out, leaving Devala weeping as if his heart would break.*";
P_HTM[189]="***Devala thought to himself, “I will let him tread on me when he comes in also.” So he turned around and lay down, placing his head where his feet had been before. When Nārada came in, he thought to himself, “The first time I injured the teacher; this time I will go in past his feet.” The result was that, when Nārada entered, he trod on Devala’s neck. Thereupon Devala cried out, “Who is that?” Nārada replied, “It is I, teacher.” “False ascetic,” said Devala, “the first time you trod on my locks; this time you tread on my neck. I will curse you.” “Teacher, I am not to blame. I did not know that you were lying in this position. When I came in I thought to myself, ‘The first time I injured the teacher; this time I will go in past his feet.’ Pardon me.” “False ascetic, I will curse you.” “Do not so, teacher.” But Devala, paying no attention to what Nārada said, cursed him all the same, saying,*";
P_HTM[190]="***The sun possesses a thousand rays and a hundred flames, is dispeller of darkness.*";
P_HTM[191]="***When the sun rises on the morrow, may your head split into seven pieces.*";
P_HTM[192]="***Nārada said, “Teacher, I told you it was not my fault. But in spite of what I said, you have cursed me. Let the head of the guilty man split into seven pieces, not that of the innocent.” Thereupon Nārada pronounced the following curse,*";
P_HTM[193]="***The sun possesses a thousand rays and a hundred flames, is dispeller of darkness.*";
P_HTM[194]="***When the sun rises on the morrow, may your head split into seven pieces.*";
P_HTM[195]="***Now Nārada possessed great supernatural power and could call to mind eighty cycles of time, forty cycles in the past and forty in the future. So considering, “On whom will the curse fall?” and perceiving that it would fall on his brother-ascetic, he felt compassion for him, and therefore put forth the power of his magic and prevented the sun from rising.*";
P_HTM[196]="***When the sun failed to rise, the citizens assembled before the gate of the king’s palace and wailed, “Your majesty, the sun has not risen, and you are king. Make the sun rise for us,” The king surveyed his own deeds, words, and thoughts, and seeing no impropriety, thought to himself, “What can be the cause?” Suspecting that it might be because of a quarrel of the monks, he inquired, “Are there any monks in this city?” “Your majesty, last evening there were some arrivals at the potter’s hall.” The king immediately went there with torches carried before him, paid obeisance to Nārada, seated himself respectfully on one side, and said,*";
P_HTM[197]="***Nārada, the people of the Land of the Rose-Apple are unable to pursue their wonted occupations.*";
P_HTM[198]="***Why is the world overspread with darkness? Tell me in answer to my question.*";
P_HTM[199]="***Nārada told him the whole story. “For this reason,” said he, “I was cursed by this ascetic. So I cursed him back, saying, ‘I am not to blame; let the curse fall upon whichever of us is to blame.’ But when I had cursed him, I considered within myself, ‘Upon whom will the curse fall?’ and perceived that, as soon as the sun rose, the head of my brother-ascetic would split into seven pieces. Therefore, out of pity for him, I am not permitting the sun to rise.” “But, Reverend Sir, how can he escape destruction?” “He may escape destruction by begging my pardon.”*";
P_HTM[200]="***“Well then,” said the king to Devala, “beg his pardon.” Devala replied, “Great king, this fellow trod on my matted locks and on my neck; I will not beg pardon of this false ascetic.” “Beg his pardon, Reverend Sir; do not act thus.” “Great king, I will not beg his pardon.” “Your head will split into seven pieces.” “Nevertheless I will not beg his pardon.” “I am convinced that you will not beg his pardon of your own free will,” said the king. Thereupon, taking him by the hands, feet, belly, and neck, the king compelled him to bow down before Nārada’s feet. Nārada said, “Rise, teacher, I pardon you.” Then said Nārada to the king, “Great king, since this ascetic does not ask pardon of his own free will, take him to a certain lake not far from the city, put a lump of clay on top of his head, and make him stand in the water up to his neck.”*";
P_HTM[201]="***The king did so. Then said Nārada to Devala, “Teacher, I will put forth my magical power and cause the sun to rise. At that moment duck in the water, rise in a different place, and go your way.” As soon as the sun’s rays touched the lump of clay, it split into seven pieces. Thereupon Devala ducked in the water, rose in a different place, and ran away. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[202]="***When the Teacher had given this religious instruction, he said, “Monks, at that time the king was Ānanda, Devala was Tissa, and Nārada was I myself; at that time also he was obstinate.” Then he addressed the Elder Tissa as follows, “Tissa, if a monk allows himself to think, ‘So and So abused me. So and So struck me. So and So defeated me. So and So robbed me of my goods,’ his hatred never ceases. But if he does not cherish such thoughts, his hatred ceases.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[203]="***3. “He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me;”*";
P_HTM[204]="***If any cherish this thought, their hatred never ceases.*";
P_HTM[205]="***4. “He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me;”*";
P_HTM[206]="***If any cherish not this thought, their hatred ceases.*";
P_HTM[207]="*[4] 4. Kāḷayakkhinīvatthu**4. Not Hatred for Hatred*";
P_HTM[208]="***5. For not by hatred are hatreds ever quenched here in this world.*";
P_HTM[209]="***By love rather are they quenched. This is an eternal law.*";
P_HTM[210]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain barren woman.*";
P_HTM[211]="***It appears that a certain householder’s son, on the death of his father, did all the farm and household work by himself alone and took care of his mother to boot. Now his mother said to him, “Dear son, I will fetch you a young woman to wife.” “Dear mother, speak not thus; my sole desire is to care for you so long as you shall live.” “Dear son, you alone are doing all the farm and household work, and I am not satisfied to have it so; let me fetch you a young woman to wife.” He protested time and again, and then held his peace.*";
P_HTM[212]="***The mother left the house, intending to go to a certain family and fetch home the daughter of that family. Her son asked her, “To what family are you going?” “To such and such a family.” He would not let her go to the family she had in mind, but told her of a family he liked better. So she went to the family he fancied, selected a wife for her son, and having set the day, installed her in her son’s house. The woman turned out to be barren.*";
P_HTM[213]="***Then said the mother to the son, “Son, you had me fetch you a wife you yourself selected. Now she turns out to be barren. Without children a family dies out, and the line is not continued. Therefore let me fetch you another young woman to wife.” “Enough said, dear mother,” replied the son; but the mother repeated her request time and again. The barren wife heard the talk and thought to herself, “It is certain that sons cannot disobey the words of their mothers and fathers. Now if she fetches him a wife who is fruitful, they will treat me like a slave. Suppose I were to fetch him a young woman of my own selection?”*";
P_HTM[214]="***So the barren wife went to a certain family and selected a young woman for him. But she immediately encountered the opposition of the young woman’s parents, who said to her, “Woman, what say you?” The barren wife replied, “I am a barren woman, and without children a family dies out. If your daughter gives birth to a son, she will be mistress of the family and the wealth thereof. Therefore give your daughter to me for my husband.” She finally prevailed upon them to grant her request, and taking the young woman with her, installed her in her husband’s house.*";
P_HTM[215]="***Then this thought occurred to her, “If my rival gives birth to a son or a daughter, she alone will be mistress of the household. I must see to it that she shall not give birth to a child.” So the barren wife said to her rival, “As soon as you have conceived a child in your womb, pray let me know.” “Very well,” replied her rival. In accordance with her promise, as soon as she had conceived, she told her fellow-wife.*";
P_HTM[216]="***Now the barren wife was accustomed to give her rival a meal of rice-porridge regularly every day with her own hand. So along with the food she gave her a drug to cause abortion. The result was that her rival had a miscarriage. Again the second time the fruitful wife conceived a child and informed the barren wife. And again her fellow-wife did as before and brought about a miscarriage.*";
P_HTM[217]="***The women who lived in the neighborhood asked the fruitful wife, “Is not your rival putting an obstacle in your way?” When she told them the facts, they said to her, “You foolish woman, why did you do this? This woman was afraid you would get the upper hand. So she mixed a preparation to bring about a miscarriage and gave it to you. Do not tell her again.” Accordingly the third time the fruitful wife said nothing to her rival. But the barren wife, seeing her belly, said to her, “Why did you not tell me that you had conceived a child?” Said the fruitful wife, “It was you who brought me here, and twice you have caused me to suffer a miscarriage; why should I tell you?”*";
P_HTM[218]="***“Now I am lost,” thought the barren wife. From that time on she watched to catch her rival off her guard. When the babe in the womb was fully matured, she took advantage of an opportunity, mixed a drug, and gave it to her. But because the babe in her womb was fully mature, an abortion was out of the question, and the result was that the child lodged across the neck of the womb. Immediately the mother suffered acute pains and feared that her hour had come.*";
P_HTM[219]="***“You have killed me!” she cried. “It was you alone that brought me here; it was you alone that killed my three children. Now I also am going to die. When I have passed out of this existence, may I be reborn as an ogress able to devour your children.” And having made this Earnest Wish, she died, and was reborn in that very house as a cat. The husband seized the barren wife, and saying to her, “It was you who destroyed my family,” beat her soundly with elbows, knees, and otherwise. As the result of the beating she received, she sickened and died, and was reborn in that very house as a hen.*";
P_HTM[220]="***So the fruitful wife was reborn as a cat, and the barren wife was reborn as a hen. The hen laid eggs, and the cat came and ate them. This happened three times. Said the hen, “Three times have you eaten my eggs, and now you are seeking an opportunity to eat me too. When I have passed out of this existence, may I be able to eat you and your offspring.” And having made this Earnest Wish, she passed out of that existence, and was reborn as a leopardess. The cat was reborn as a doe.*";
P_HTM[221]="***So the barren wife, at the end of her existence as a hen, was reborn as a leopardess; and the fruitful wife, at the end of her existence as a cat, was reborn as a doe. Thrice the doe brought forth young, and thrice the leopardess went and devoured the doe’s offspring. When the doe came to die, she said, “Thrice this beast has devoured my offspring, and now she purposes to devour me too. When I have passed out of this existence, may I be able to devour her and her offspring.” And having made this Earnest Wish, she was reborn as an ogress. When the leopardess passed out of that existence, she was reborn at Sāvatthi as a young woman of station.*";
P_HTM[222]="***So the fruitful wife, at the end of her existence as a doe, was reborn as an ogress; and the barren wife, at the end of her existence as a leopardess, was reborn at Sāvatthi as a young woman of station. When the latter grew up, she was married and went to live with her husband’s family in a little settlement near the gate of the city. After a time she gave birth to a son. The ogress disguised herself as a dear friend of the young woman and went to see her. “Where is my friend?” said the ogress. “In the inner room; she has just given birth to a child.” “Did she give birth to a son or a daughter? I should like to see her.” So saying, the ogress went in. While pretending to be looking at the child, she seized him, devoured him, and then went out. Again a second time she devoured a child of the young wife in the same way.*";
P_HTM[223]="***The third time the young wife was great with child she addressed her husband, “Husband, in this place an ogress has devoured two sons of mine and escaped. This time I intend to go to the house of my parents to give birth to my child.”*";
P_HTM[224]="***Now at this time that ogress was away doing her turn at drawing water. (For Vessavaṇa’s ogresses take their turn at drawing water from lake Anotatta, passing it along from the source. At the expiration of four or five months they are released; the others die of exhaustion.) The moment the ogress was released from her turn at drawing water she went quickly to the young wife’s house and inquired, “Where is my friend?” “Where you will not see her. There is an ogress that devours every child she bears in this house, and therefore, she has gone to the house of her parents.” “She may go wherever she likes, but she will not escape from me.” Spurred on by an impulse of hatred, the ogress dashed towards the city.*";
P_HTM[225]="***On the day appointed for the naming of the child the mother bathed him, gave him a name, and then said to her husband, “Husband, now we will go back to our own home.” Accordingly she took the boy in her arms and set out with her husband along the path leading through the grounds of the monastery. When they reached the monastery pool, the young wife gave the boy to her husband and bathed in the pool. When she had finished her bath, her husband bathed in the pool. While the husband was bathing, the wife remained near, giving suck to her child.*";
P_HTM[226]="***Just then the ogress drew near. The young wife saw her coming and recognized her. Immediately she screamed with a loud voice, “Husband! husband! come quickly! come quickly! here is that ogress!” Not daring to wait until her husband came, she turned and dashed into the monastery.*";
P_HTM[227]="***Now at this time the Teacher was preaching the Law in the midst of the congregation. The young wife laid her boy at the feet of the Tathāgata and said, “I give you this child; spare the life of my son.” The deity Sumana, who resided in the embattled chamber over the gate, prevented the ogress from entering. The Teacher addressed the Elder Ānanda, saying, “Go, Ānanda, summon that ogress within.” The Elder summoned her within. The young wife said, “Here she comes, Reverend Sir.” Said the Teacher, “Let her come; make no noise.”*";
P_HTM[228]="***When the ogress came and stood before him, the Teacher said, “Why have you so done? Had you not come face to face with a Buddha like me, you would have cherished hatred towards each other for an aeon, like the Snake and the Mongoos, who trembled and quaked with enmity, like the Crows and the Owls. Why do you return hatred for hatred? Hatred is quenched by love, not by hatred.” And when he had thus spoken, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[229]="***5. For not by hatred are hatreds ever quenched here in this world.*";
P_HTM[230]="***By love rather are they quenched. This is an eternal law.*";
P_HTM[231]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza the ogress was established in the Fruit of Conversion.*";
P_HTM[232]="***The Teacher said to the woman, “Give your child to this ogress.” “I am afraid to, Reverend Sir.” “Fear not. You have no reason to be alarmed because of her.” The young wife gave her child to the ogress. The ogress kissed and caressed him, gave him back again to his mother, and began to weep. The Teacher asked her, “Why do you weep?” “Reverend Sir, in the past I have managed somehow or other to get a living, but I have never had enough to eat. Now how am I to live?” Then the Teacher comforted her, saying, “Do not worry.” And turning to the mother, he said, “Take this ogress home with you, let her live in your own house, and feed her with the choicest rice-porridge.”*";
P_HTM[233]="***So the young wife took the ogress home with her, lodged her on the central rafter of the hut, and fed her with the choicest rice-porridge. Now when the rice was threshed and the flail was raised, she feared that it would strike her head. So she said to her friend, “I shall not be able to live here any longer; lodge me elsewhere.” She was lodged successively in the flail-hut, the water-chatty, the bake-house, the storeroom for nimbs, the dust-heap, and the village gate. But she refused to live in any of these places, saying, “Here the flail rises as if it would split my head in two; here boys empty out slops; here dogs lie down; here boys attend to nature’s needs; here they throw away sweepings; here village boys practice fortune-telling.” So they lodged her in a quiet place by herself outside of the village, and there they brought her the choicest rice-porridge.*";
P_HTM[234]="***The ogress said to her friend, “This year there will be abundance of rain; therefore plant your crops in a dry place. This year there will be a drought; therefore plant your crops in a moist place.” Other people’s crops were destroyed either by excessive moisture or by drought, but the crops of the young wife flourished above measure.*";
P_HTM[235]="***People asked the young wife, “Woman, your crops are destroyed neither by excessive moisture nor by drought. When you plant your crops, you seem to know in advance whether the season will be wet or dry. How is this?” The young wife replied, “I have a friend, an ogress, who tells me whether the season will be wet or dry; and I plant my crops according to her directions on high or low ground. Don’t you see? Every day the choicest rice-porridge and other kinds of food are carried out of our house; to her are they carried. Do you also carry the choicest rice-porridge and other kinds of food to her, and she will look after your crops also.”*";
P_HTM[236]="***Straightway all the residents of the city rendered honor to her. On her part, from that time forth, she looked after the crops of all. And she received abundant gifts and a large retinue. Subsequently she established the Eight Ticket-foods, which are kept up even to this present day.*";
P_HTM[237]="*[5] 5. Kosambakavatthu**5. The Quarrelsome Monks of Kosambi*";
P_HTM[238]="***6. But others do not understand that we must here control ourselves;*";
P_HTM[239]="***Yet let them understand this, and straight dissensions cease.*";
P_HTM[240]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the monks of Kosambi.*";
P_HTM[241]="***5 a. Quarrel among the monks*";
P_HTM[242]="***For at Kosambi, in Ghosita monastery, resided two monks, each with a retinue of five hundred monks. Of the two monks, one was a student of the Discipline, the other a preacher of the Law. One day the preacher of the Law, after easing himself, left in a vessel what remained of the water in which he had washed in the bathroom and came out. Afterwards the student of the Discipline went in and saw the water. When he came out, he asked his companion, “Brother, was it you that left the water?” “Yes, brother.” “But do you not know that it is a sin so to do?” “Indeed I do not.” “But, brother, it is a sin.” “Well then, I will make satisfaction for it.” “Of course, brother, if you did it unintentionally, inadvertently, it is no sin.” Thus the preacher of the Law came to look upon the sin as no sin.*";
P_HTM[243]="***Notwithstanding, the student of the Discipline said to his own pupils, “This preacher of the Law, although he has committed sin, does not realize it.” They, seeing the pupils of the preacher of the Law, said, “Your preceptor, although he has committed sin, does not realize it.” The preacher’s pupils went and informed their own preceptor. The preacher of the Law spoke thus, “This student of the Discipline said before, ‘It’s no sin.’ Now he says, ‘It is a sin.’ He’s a liar.” The preacher’s pupils went and said, “Your teacher is a liar.” Thus did they foment a quarrel between the two. Then the student of the Discipline, seizing the opportunity, pronounced sentence of excommunication against the preacher of the Law for failing to recognize his sin. Thenceforth even the supporters who furnished them the Requisites formed two factions. Even the nuns receiving instruction, even the protecting deities; their friends and intimates, the deities who dwell in the sky; beginning with these and extending to the world of Brahmā, all beings, even the unconverted, formed two factions. The quarrel extended from the Realm of the Four Great Kings to the Heaven of the Gods Sublime.*";
P_HTM[244]="***Now a certain monk drew near the Tathāgata and told him that those who pronounced the sentence of excommunication held the view that the monk had been excommunicated according to law; but that the partisans of the excommunicated monk held the view that he had been excommunicated contrary to law, and that the latter had gathered round in support of him, in spite of the fact that those who pronounced the sentence of excommunication forbade them to do so. Twice the Exalted One sent word, “Let them be united,” and received the reply, “Venerable Sir, they refuse to be united.” The third time he exclaimed, “The congregation of monks is rent asunder! The congregation of monks is rent asunder!” So saying, he went to them and pointed out to those who had pronounced sentence of excommunication the wrong involved in their act, and to those who had failed to recognize sin the wrong involved in theirs. Again he enjoined upon them the holding of fast-day and other ceremonies right there within the boundary, and laid down the rule that those who quarreled in refectories and elsewhere were to occupy separate seats in the refectory.*";
P_HTM[245]="***Hearing that they were quarreling again, he went to them, and beginning his discourse with the words, “Enough, monks! No quarreling!” he continued, “Monks, quarrels, strifes, contentions, disputes, – all these are unprofitable. For because of a quarrel even a tiny quail brought about the destruction of a noble elephant.” And he told the Birth-Story of the Tiny Quail. Continuing, he said: “Monks, be united; engage not in disputes. For because of a dispute many thousand quails lost their lives.” And he told the Birth-Story of the Quails.*";
P_HTM[246]="***But in spite of this they paid no attention to his words, and a certain heretical teacher, who wished the Tathāgata to be relieved of annoyance, said to him, “Reverend Sir, let the Exalted One, the Lord of Truth, remain at home. Reverend Sir, let the Exalted One live a life of inaction and ease in this present world. We shall make ourselves notorious by our quarrels, strifes, contentions, and disputes.” Thereupon the Tathāgata told the following Story of the Past:*";
P_HTM[247]="***“Once upon a time, monks, Brahmadatta reigned at Benāres as king of Kāsi. Brahmadatta fought against Dīghati Kosala, took away his kingdom, and killed him while he was living in disguise. Dīghati’s son, Prince Dīghāvu, although he knew that Brahmadatta was the murderer of his father, spared his life. Thenceforth they were at peace with each other. Such, monks, is said to have been the patience and gentleness of these kings who took scepter and sword. How much more, monks, should you, who have retired from the world under a Law and Discipline so well taught, let your light so shine in this world as to be known of men as patient and gentle.” Thus did the Teacher admonish them.*";
P_HTM[248]="***But in spite of his admonition he was unable to reunite them. Thereupon, unhappy because of the crowded conditions under which he lived, he reflected, “Under present conditions I am crowded and jostled and live a life of discomfort. Moreover, these monks pay no attention to what I say. Suppose I were to retire from the haunts of men and live a life of solitude.”*";
P_HTM[249]="***After making his round for alms in Kosambi, without bidding the Congregation of Monks farewell, he took his own bowl and robe, and went quite alone to the village of Bālaka, the salt-maker, where he discoursed to the Elder Bhagu on the solitary life; thence he went to Eastern Bamboo Deer-park, where he discoursed to the three youths of station on the bliss of the sweets of concord; and from there he went to Pārileyyaka. There, at the foot of a beautiful Sāl-tree, in Protected Forest, near Pārileyyaka, the Exalted One spent the rainy season pleasantly, attended by the elephant Pārileyyaka.*";
P_HTM[250]="***When the lay brethren resident at Kosambi went to the monastery and failed to see the Teacher, they asked, “Reverend Sirs, where has the Teacher gone?” “To Pārileyyaka Forest.” “For what reason?” “He strove to reunite us, but we would not be reunited.” “Do you mean, Reverend Sirs, that after receiving admission as monks at the hands of the Teacher, you refused to agree when he asked you to do so?” “Precisely so, brethren.” People said, “These monks, after receiving admission at the hands of the Teacher, were unwilling to patch up their differences when the Teacher asked them to do so. It’s all their fault that we were unable to see the Teacher. To these monks, assuredly, we will neither give seats nor offer respectful salutations or other civilities.” And from that time on they showed them not so much as a sign of civility.*";
P_HTM[251]="***The monks got so little food that they were nearly famished, and it required only a few days to bring them to a better state of mind. Then they confessed their sins, one to another, asked to be pardoned, and said, “Brethren, we are reconciled; be to us as before.” “Reverend Sirs, have you begged the Teacher’s pardon?” “No, we haven’t, brethren.” “Well then, beg the Teacher’s pardon, and as soon as the Teacher has pardoned you, we will be to you as before.” But as the rainy season was then at its height, they were unable to go to the Teacher and spent the rainy season very uncomfortably. The Teacher, however, spent the time pleasantly, attended by an elephant. For this elephant, of noble breed, left his herd and entered the forest for the sole purpose of having a pleasant time. As it is said,*";
P_HTM[252]="***5 b. The Buddha, the elephant, and the monkey*";
P_HTM[253]="***“Here I live, crowded by elephants, female elephants, elephant calves, and young elephants. They have chewed off the tips of the grass I eat; they eat branch after branch I break down; they muddy the water I have to drink. Whenever I plunge into the water, or come up out of the water, the female elephants come and rub against my body. Suppose I were to retire from the herd and live all alone.”*";
P_HTM[254]="***So then this noble elephant withdrew from the herd and drew near to Pārileyyaka, to Protected Forest, to the foot of the beautiful Sāl-tree; even to where the Exalted One was, thither did he draw near. And when he had drawn near and paid obeisance to the Exalted One, he looked all about for a broom. And seeing none, he smote with his foot the beautiful Sāl-tree below and hewed away with his trunk at the Sāl-tree above. And taking a branch, he then swept the ground.*";
P_HTM[255]="***Then he took a water-pot in his trunk and procured drinking-water. And as hot water was required, he prepared hot water. (How was that possible?) First he produced sparks with a fire-drill which he worked with his trunk; then he dropped sticks of wood on the sparks. Thus did he kindle a fire. In the fire he heated small stones; these he rolled along with a stick and dropped into a little depression in the rock. Then, lowering his trunk and finding the water hot enough, he went and made obeisance to the Teacher. The Teacher asked, “Is your water hot, Pārileyyaka?” and went there and bathed. After that the elephant brought various kinds of wild fruits and presented them to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[256]="***Now when the Teacher enters the village for alms, the elephant takes his bowl and robe, puts them on top of his head, and accompanies him. When the Teacher reaches the vicinity of the village, he bids the elephant bring him his bowl and robe, saying, “Pārileyyaka, farther than this you are not permitted to go. Fetch me my bowl and robe.” The Teacher then enters the village, and the elephant stands right there until he returns. When the Teacher returns, the elephant advances to meet him, takes his bowl and robe just as he did before, deposits them in the Teacher’s place of abode, pays him the usual courtesies, and fans him with the branch of a tree. At night, to ward off danger from beasts of prey, he takes a big club in his trunk, says to himself, “I’ll protect the Teacher,” and back and forth in the interstices of the forest he paces until sunrise. (From that time forth, we are told, that forest was called “Protected Forest.”) When the sun rises, the elephant gives the Teacher water wherewith to bathe his face, and in the manner before related performs all of the other duties.*";
P_HTM[257]="***Now a monkey saw the elephant up and doing each day, performing the lesser duties for the Tathāgata, and he said to himself, “I’ll do something too.” One day, as he was running about, he happened to see some stick-honey free from flies. He broke the stick off, took the honey-comb, stick and all, broke off a plantain-leaf, placed the honey on the leaf, and offered it to the Teacher. The Teacher took it. The monkey watched to see whether or not he would eat it. He observed that the Teacher, after taking the honey, sat down without eating. “What can be the matter?” thought he. He took hold of the stick by the tip, turned it over and over, carefully examining it as he did so, whereupon he discovered some insect’s eggs. Having removed these gently, he again gave the honey to the Teacher. The Teacher ate it.*";
P_HTM[258]="***The monkey was so delighted that he leaped from one branch to another and danced about in great glee. But the branches he grasped and the branches he stepped on broke off. Down he fell on the stump of a tree and was impaled. So he died. And solely because of his faith in the Teacher he was reborn in the World of the Thirty-three in a golden mansion thirty leagues in measure, with a retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs.*";
P_HTM[259]="***It became known over all the Land of the Rose-apple that the Teacher was residing in Protected Forest, attended by a noble elephant. From the city of Sāvatthi, Anāthapiṇḍika, Visākhā, the eminent female lay disciple, and other such great personages sent the following message to the Elder Ānanda,*";
P_HTM[260]="***“Reverend Sir, obtain for us the privilege of seeing the Teacher.” Likewise five hundred monks residing abroad approached the Elder Ānanda at the close of the rainy season and made the following request, “It is a long time, Ānanda, since we have heard a discourse on the Law from the lips of the Exalted One. We should like, brother Ānanda, if you please, to have the privilege of hearing a discourse on the Law from the lips of the Exalted One.”*";
P_HTM[261]="***So the Elder took those monks with him and went to Protected Forest. When he reached the forest, he thought to himself, “The Tathāgata has resided in solitude for a period of three months. It is therefore not fitting that I should approach him all at once with so many monks as these.” Accordingly he left those monks outside and approached the Teacher quite alone. When the elephant Pārileyyaka saw the Elder, he took his staff and rushed forward. The Teacher looked around and said to the elephant, “Come back, Pārileyyaka; do not drive him away. He is a servitor of the Buddha.” The elephant immediately threw away his staff and requested the privilege of taking the Elder’s bowl and robe. The Elder refused. The elephant thought to himself, “If he is versed in the rules of etiquette, he will refrain from placing his monastic requisites on the stone slab where the Teacher is accustomed to sit.” The Elder placed his bowl and robe on the ground. (For those who are versed in the rules of etiquette never place their own monastic requisites on the seat or bed of their spiritual superiors.) The Elder, after saluting the Teacher, seated himself on one side.*";
P_HTM[262]="***The Teacher asked him, “Did you come alone?” The Elder informed him that he had come with five hundred monks. “But where are they?” asked the Teacher. “I did not know how you would feel about it, and therefore I left them outside and came in alone.” “Tell them to come in.” The Elder did so. The Teacher exchanged friendly greetings with the monks. Then the monks said to the Teacher,*";
P_HTM[263]="***“Reverend Sir, the Exalted One is a delicate Buddha, a delicate prince. You must have endured much hardship, standing and sitting here alone as you have during these three months. For of course you had no one to perform the major and minor duties for you, no one to offer you water for bathing the face or to perform any of the other duties for you.” The Teacher replied,*";
P_HTM[264]="***“Monks, the elephant Pārileyyaka performed all of these offices for me. For one who obtains such a companion as he may well live alone; did one fail to find such, even so the life of solitude were better for him.” So saying, he pronounced these three Stanzas in the Nāga Vagga,*";
P_HTM[265]="***328. Should one find a prudent companion to walk with, an upright man and steadfast,*";
P_HTM[266]="***Let one walk with him, joyful, mindful, overcoming all dangers.*";
P_HTM[267]="***329. Should one not find a prudent companion to walk with, an upright man and steadfast,*";
P_HTM[268]="***Then like a king renouncing the kingdom he has conquered, let one walk alone,*";
P_HTM[269]="***Like an elephant roaming at will in an elephant-forest.*";
P_HTM[270]="***330. The life of solitude is better; one cannot be friends with a simpleton;*";
P_HTM[271]="***Let a man live in solitude, and do no evil deeds,*";
P_HTM[272]="***Taking his ease, like an elephant roaming at will in an elephant-forest.*";
P_HTM[273]="***At the conclusion of the Stanzas the five hundred monks were established in Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[274]="***The Elder Ānanda then delivered the message sent by Anāthapiṇḍika and the rest, saying, “Reverend Sir, fifty million Noble Disciples headed by Anāthapiṇḍika desire your return.” “Very well,” said the Teacher, “take bowl and robe.” Causing them to take bowl and robe, he set out. The elephant went and stood crosswise on the road. “Reverend Sir, what is the elephant doing?” “Monks, he desires to give alms to you. For a long time he has served me; it is not right to hurt his feelings. Turn back, monks!” The Teacher and the monks turned back. The elephant entered the forest, gathered bananas and various other fruits, heaped them together, and on the following day gave them to the monks. The five hundred monks were unable to dispose of them all. When they had finished eating, the Teacher took bowl and robe and set out. The elephant, threading his way through the monks, went and stood crosswise in front of the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[275]="***“Reverend Sir, what is the elephant doing?” “Monks, having sped your parting, he desires to make me turn back.” Said the Teacher to the elephant, “Pārileyyaka, I am going now, never to return. You cannot hope in this existence to enter into states of trance, or to attain Spiritual Insight, or the Paths, or the Fruits. Halt!” When the elephant heard that, he thrust his trunk into his mouth and retreated very slowly, weeping as he went. (Could he have made the Teacher turn back, he would have cared for him in the very same way to the end of his days.)*";
P_HTM[276]="***Now when the Teacher reached the vicinity of the village, he said, “Pārileyyaka, farther than this it is unsafe for you to go. The habitations of men are fraught with danger to you. Halt!” The elephant halted where he was and wept. As the Teacher slowly passed out of sight, he died of a broken heart. Through faith in the Teacher he was reborn in the World of the Thirty-three in a golden mansion thirty leagues in measure, with a retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs. God Pārileyyaka was his name.*";
P_HTM[277]="***The Teacher arrived in due course at Jetavana. The monks of Kosambi, hearing of the Teacher’s return to Sāvatthi, went thither to beg his pardon. The king of Kosala, hearing that the quarrelsome monks of Kosambi had come to Sāvatthi, approached the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, I’ll not allow those monks to come into my country.” “Great king, these monks are good men; only because of a dispute they had with each other they paid no attention to my words. Now they are coming to beg my pardon; let them come, great king.” Anāthapiṇḍika also said, “I’ll not allow those monks to enter the monastery.” But the Teacher took issue with him as he had with the king, and he was silent.*";
P_HTM[278]="***Now when those monks reached Sāvatthi, the Exalted One gave orders that separate lodging should be prepared and given to them. The other monks neither sit nor stand in their company. One after another those who come ask the Teacher, “Where, Reverend Sir, are the quarrelsome monks of Kosambi?” The Teacher points them out, saying, “There they are!” “There they are! There they are!” One after another those who come point their fingers at them, until for shame they are unable to lift their heads. Then they threw themselves at the feet of the Exalted One and asked him to pardon them. Said the Teacher,*";
P_HTM[279]="***“Monks, grievous was the sin you committed when, after receiving admission as monks at the hands of a Buddha like me, in spite of my efforts to reconcile you, you refused to obey my words. Even wise men of old hearkened to the admonition of their mother and father under sentence of death, disobeyed it not, even while their parents were being deprived of life, and afterwards established their sovereignty over two kingdoms.” So saying, he related the Kosambika Jātaka once more, concluding as follows,*";
P_HTM[280]="***“Thus, monks, Prince Dīghāvu, even while his mother and father were being deprived of life, disobeyed not their admonition and afterwards, obtaining Brahmadatta’s daughter in marriage, bore sway over the two kingdoms of Kāsi and Kosala. You, however, disobeyed my words, and thereby committed a grievous sin.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[281]="***6. But others do not understand that we must here control ourselves;*";
P_HTM[282]="***Yet let them understand this, and straight dissensions cease.*";
P_HTM[283]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza the assembled monks were established in the Fruit of Conversion.*";

P_HTM[291]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence near the city Setavya with reference to Kāḷa junior and Kāḷa senior, Culla Kāḷa and Mahā Kāḷa.*";
P_HTM[292]="***For Culla Kāḷa, Majjhima Kāḷa, and Mahā Kāḷa were three householders who lived in Setavya, and they were brothers. Culla Kāḷa and Mahā Kāḷa, the oldest and youngest respectively, used to travel abroad with their caravan of five hundred carts and bring home goods to sell, and Majjhima Kāḷa sold the goods they brought. Now on a certain occasion the two brothers, taking wares of various kinds in their five hundred carts, set out for Sāvatthi, and halting between Sāvatthi and Jetavana, unharnessed their carts.*";
P_HTM[293]="***At eventide Mahā Kāḷa saw Noble Disciples, residents of Sāvatthi, with garlands and perfumes in their hands, going to hear the Law. “Where are they going?” he asked. Receiving the answer that they were going to hear the Law, he thought to himself, “I will go too.” So he addressed his youngest brother, “Dear brother, keep watch over the carts; I am going to hear the Law.” So saying, he went and paid obeisance to the Tathāgata and sat down in the outer circle of the congregation.*";
P_HTM[294]="***On that day the Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequence with reference to Mahā Kāḷa’s disposition of mind, and quoting the Sutta on the Aggregate of Suffering, and other Suttas, discoursed on the sinfulness and folly and contamination of sensual pleasures. Mahā Kāḷa, after listening to the discourse, thought to himself, “So a man must needs leave all things behind him when he goes hence. When a man goes to the world beyond, neither wealth nor kinsmen can follow him. Why should I continue to live the life of a householder? I will become a monk.” Accordingly, when the multitude had paid obeisance to the Teacher and departed, he requested the Teacher to receive him into the Order.*";
P_HTM[295]="***“Have you no kinsman of whom it is proper that you should ask permission?” inquired the Teacher. “I have a younger brother, Reverend Sir.” “Ask his permission.” “Very well, Reverend Sir.” So Mahā Kāḷa went to Culla Kāḷa and said to him, “Dear brother, receive all this wealth.” “But you, brother?” “I intend to retire from the world under the Teacher.” Culla Kāḷa used all manner of arguments to dissuade his brother from carrying out his intention, but in vain. Finally he said to him, “Very well, master; do as you wish.” So Mahā Kāḷa went and became a monk under the Teacher. Culla Kāḷa likewise became a monk. But the thought in Culla Kāḷa’s mind was, “After a time I will return to the world and take my brother with me.”*";
P_HTM[296]="***Somewhat later Mahā Kāḷa made his full profession, and approaching the Teacher, asked him, “How many duties are there in this Religion?” The Teacher informed him that there were two. Said Mahā Kāḷa, “Reverend Sir, since I became a monk in old age, I shall not be able to fulfill the Duty of Study, but I can fulfill the Duty of Contemplation.” So he had the Teacher instruct him in the Pure Practice of a Burning-grounder, which leads to Arahatship. At the end of the first watch, when everyone else was asleep, he went to the burning-ground; and at dawn, before anyone else had risen, he returned to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[297]="***Now the keeper of the burning-ground, a certain woman named Kāḷī, whose duty was to burn the bodies of the dead, saw the Elder as he stood up and sat down and walked about. And she thought to herself, “Who can this be that comes here? I will find out about him.” But she was unable to find out what she wished to find out about him. So one night she lighted a lamp in the hut of the burning-ground, and taking son and daughter with her, hid herself on one side of the burning-ground. When she saw the Elder approach, she approached him, paid obeisance to him, and asked him, “Reverend Sir, does our noble monk reside in this place?” “Yes, lay sister.” “Reverend Sir, those that reside in a burning-ground have certain rules to observe.” The Elder did not say, “Do you think I shall observe any rules of your telling?” Instead he said, “What ought I to do, lay sister?”*";
P_HTM[298]="***Said the keeper of the burning-ground, “Reverend Sir, they that reside in a burning-ground are bound to declare the fact to the keepers of the burning-ground, to the Chief Elder at the monastery, and to the village headman.” “Why?” “Thieves who commit depredations, when pursued by lawful owners of property, frequently flee to a burning-ground and leave their spoils there; then the owners come and threaten residents of the burning-ground with harm. But if the authorities are duly informed, they can avert trouble by saying, ‘We know for a fact that this reverend monk has resided here for such and such a length of time; he is no thief.’ For this reason you are bound to declare your intention to the authorities I have mentioned.”*";
P_HTM[299]="***Mahā Kāḷa then asked, “Is there anything else I ought to do?” “Reverend Sir, so long as your reverence resides in a burning-ground, you must abstain from fish, flesh, sesame, flour, oil, and molasses. You must not sleep by day. You must not be slothful. You must live with high resolve, exerting all the powers of your will, avoiding double-dealing and deceit. At eventide, when all are asleep, you must leave the monastery and come here; at dawn, before any have risen, you must return to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[300]="***“In case, Reverend Sir, while you reside in this burning-ground, you succeed in reaching the goal of the Religious Life, and they bring a dead body here and cast it away, I will place it on the funeral pyre, and rendering the usual honors with perfumes and garlands, I will perform the funeral rites over the body. If you do not succeed, I will light the pyre, drag the body along with a stake, throw it outside, chop it to pieces with an axe, throw the pieces into the fire, and burn it.” The Elder said to her, “Very well, woman. But in case you should see a corpse which you think would afford me a suitable Subject of Meditation on Material Form, be good enough to tell me.” “Very well,” said she, promising him to do so.*";
P_HTM[301]="***In accordance with his intention the Elder Mahā Kāḷa performed his meditations in the burning-ground. The Elder Culla Kāḷa, however, busy and active, thinking always of the house-life, remembering son and wife, said to himself, “It is an excessively difficult task my brother is engaged in.”*";
P_HTM[302]="***Now a certain young woman of station was attacked by a disease, and the very moment the disease attacked her, she died, at eventide, without a sign of withering or weariness. In the evening her kinsfolk and friends brought her body to the burning-ground, with firewood, oil, and other requisites, and said to the keeper of the burning-ground, “Burn this body.” And paying the keeper the usual fee, they turned the body over to her and departed. When the keeper of the burning-ground removed the woman’s dress and beheld her beautiful golden-hued body, she straightway thought to herself, “This corpse is a suitable Subject of Meditation to show to his reverence.” So she went to the Elder, paid obeisance to him, and said, “I have a remarkably good Subject of Meditation; pray look at it, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[303]="***“Very well,” said the Elder. So he went and caused the dress which covered the corpse to be removed, and surveyed the body from the soles of the feet to the tips of the hair. Then he said, “Throw this beautiful golden-hued body into the fire, and so soon as the tongues of fire have laid hold of it, please tell me.” So saying, he went to his own place and sat down.*";
P_HTM[304]="***The keeper of the burning-ground did as she was told and went and informed the Elder. The Elder came and surveyed the body. Where the flames had touched the flesh, the color of her body was like that of a mottled cow; the feet stuck out and hung down; the hands were curled back; the forehead was without skin. The Elder thought to himself, “This body, which but now caused those who looked thereon to forget the Sacred Word, has but now attained decay, has but now attained death.” And going to his night-quarters, he sat down, discerning clearly Decay and Death.*";
P_HTM[305]="***Impermanent are all existing things. It is their nature to come into existence and to decay.*";
P_HTM[306]="***They come into existence and perish. It is well when they have ceased to be.*";
P_HTM[307]="***Having recited this Stanza, Mahā Kāḷa developed Spiritual Insight and attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[308]="***When Mahā Kāḷa attained Arahatship, the Teacher, surrounded by the Congregation of Monks, traveling from place to place, arrived at Setavya and entered the Siṁsapā forest. Culla Kāḷa’s wives, hearing that the Teacher had arrived, thought to themselves, “Now we shall recover our husband.” So they sent and invited the Teacher. Now when a visit is expected from the Buddhas, it is customary to prepare a seat in a place which is not circumscribed, and in order to insure that this shall be done, it is customary for a single monk to go in advance and give warning. For the Seat of the Buddhas must be set in the midst, on the right of the Buddha must be placed the seat of the Elder Sāriputta, on his left that of the Elder Mahā Moggallāna, and next to these on both sides must be arranged the seats for the Congregation of Monks. Therefore the Elder Mahā Kāḷa, standing in the place where the bowls and robes were kept, sent forth Culla Kāḷa, saying, “You go in advance and give warning to arrange the seats.”*";
P_HTM[309]="***From the moment the members of the household caught sight of Culla Kāḷa, they made a jest of him, putting the low seats at the ends where the Elders of the Assembly were to sit, and the high seats where the novices were to sit. Culla Kāḷa said to them, “Do not arrange the seats thus; do not put the low seats above and the high seats below.” But the women, pretending not to hear him, said, “What are you doing here, walking about? What right have you to give orders about the arrangement of the seats? By whose leave did you become a monk? Who made a monk of you? What made you come here?”*";
P_HTM[310]="***And having thus made a mock of him, they tore off his under and upper garments, clothed him with white garments instead, placed a garland-coil on his head, and packed him off, saying, “Go fetch the Teacher; we will arrange the seats.” Now those who have been monks but a short time, and have returned to the world before keeping a single residence, are without a sense of shame. Therefore Culla Kāḷa, free from any anxiety on the score of his clothing, went to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and taking with him the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, returned.*";
P_HTM[311]="***When the Congregation of Monks had finished their meal, Mahā Kāḷa’s wives thought to themselves, “Culla Kāḷa’s wives recovered their husband; let us also recover ours.” Accordingly they invited the Teacher for the following day. But on this occasion a different monk came to arrange the seats, and so Mahā Kāḷa’s wives failed of an opportunity to embarrass him. When they had seated the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, they presented them with food. Now Culla Kāḷa had two wives, Majjhima Kāḷa had four, and Mahā Kāḷa had eight. Those of the monks who desired to eat sat down and ate their meal; those who desired to go out arose and went out. The Teacher sat down and ate his meal. When he had finished his meal, those women said to him, “Reverend Sir, Mahā Kāḷa will pronounce the formula of thanksgiving and then return; you go on ahead.” The Teacher said, “Very well,” and went on ahead.*";
P_HTM[312]="***When the Teacher reached the village gate, the Congregation of Monks were offended and said, “What a thing for the Teacher to do! Did he do it wittingly or unwittingly? Yesterday Culla Kāḷa came in advance, and that was the end of his monastic life. But to-day a different monk came in advance, and nothing of the sort happened.” The Teacher sent Mahā Kāḷa back and continued on his way. Said the monks, “The monk Mahā Kāḷa is virtuous and upright. Will they put an end to his monastic life?”*";
P_HTM[313]="***Hearing their words, the Teacher stopped and asked them, “What is it you are saying, monks?” When they told him, he said, “But, monks, you do not think that Mahā Kāḷa is like Culla Kāḷa?” “Yes, Reverend Sir; Culla Kāḷa has two wives, but Mahā Kāḷa has eight. If his eight wives gather about him and seize him, what can he do, Reverend Sir?” Said the Teacher, “Monks, do not speak thus. Culla Kāḷa lives a busy and active life and allows his thoughts to dwell on many pleasing objects. My son Mahā Kāḷa, on the other hand, does not live looking for pleasure, but is immovable, like a mountain of solid rock.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[314]="***7. Whoever lives looking for pleasure, exercising no restraint over his senses,*";
P_HTM[315]="***Immoderate in his enjoyments, indolent, inert,*";
P_HTM[316]="***Him Māra overpowers, even as the wind overpowers a tree of little strength.*";
P_HTM[317]="***8. Whoever lives looking not for pleasure, exercising restraint over his senses,*";
P_HTM[318]="***Moderate in his enjoyments, endowed with faith, exerting the power of his will,*";
P_HTM[319]="***Him Māra does not overpower, even as the wind does not overpower a mountain of rock.*";
P_HTM[320]="***Mahā Kāḷa’s former wives surrounded him and said to him, “By whose leave did you become a monk? Will you now become a householder?” Having said this and much more to the same effect, they sought to strip him of his yellow robes. But the Elder, divining their intention, rose from the seat where he had been sitting and flew upwards by his supernatural power, rending the peak of the pagoda asunder. And having soared through the air, he descended to the ground as the Teacher spoke the concluding words of the Stanzas, praising the golden body of the Teacher and paying obeisance at the feet of the Tathāgata.*";
P_HTM[321]="*[7] 7. Devadattavatthu**7. Devadatta Wears an Unbecoming Robe*";
P_HTM[322]="***9. Whoever, not free from impurity, lacking self-restraint and truth,*";

P_HTM[324]="***10. Whoever is free from impurity, firmly established in the moral precepts,*";
P_HTM[325]="***Possessed of self-restraint and truth, he is worthy of the yellow robe.*";
P_HTM[326]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Devadatta’s assumption of the yellow robe at Rājagaha.*";
P_HTM[327]="***For on a certain occasion the two Chief Disciples, each with a retinue of five hundred monks, took leave of the Teacher and went from Jetavana to Rājagaha. The residents of Rājagaha united by twos and threes and in larger groups and gave alms in accordance with the custom of giving alms to visitors. Now one day Venerable Sāriputta said, in making the Address of Thanksgiving, “Lay brethren, one man himself gives alms, but does not urge another to give; that man receives in succeeding states of existence the blessing of wealth, but not the blessing of a retinue. Another man urges his neighbor to give, but does not himself give; that man receives in succeeding states of existence the blessing of a retinue, but not the blessing of wealth. Another man neither himself gives alms nor urges others to give; in succeeding states of existence that man receives not so much as a bellyful of sour rice-gruel, but is forlorn and destitute. Yet another both himself gives alms and urges his neighbor to give; that man in succeeding states of existence, in a hundred states of existence, in a thousand states of existence, in a hundred thousand states of existence, receives both the blessing of wealth and the blessing of a retinue.” Thus did Venerable Sāriputta preach the Law.*";
P_HTM[328]="***A certain wise man heard him and thought to himself, “Sir, the preaching of the Law is indeed a wonderful thing; well has the means of happiness been expounded. It behooves me to do works of merit productive of these two Attainments.” So he invited the Elder to take a meal with him, saying, “Reverend Sir, accept my hospitality for to-morrow.” “How many monks have you need of, lay disciple?” “But how many monks are there in your retinue, Reverend Sir?” “A thousand, lay disciple.” “Bring all your monks with you to-morrow and accept my hospitality, Reverend Sir.” The Elder accepted the invitation.*";
P_HTM[329]="***The lay disciple went through the street of the city urging others to give alms, saying, “Men and women, I have invited a thousand monks. How many monks will you be able to provide with food? how many will you?” The people promised to provide food, each according to his means, saying, “We will give to ten; we will give to twenty; we will give to a hundred.” The lay disciple then directed them to bring their offerings to one place, saying, “Well then, let us assemble in one place and cook the food as one body. All of you bring together in one place the sesame, rice, ghee, molasses, and other articles of food.”*";
P_HTM[330]="***Now a certain householder presented a perfumed yellow robe worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, saying, “If your combined alms prove insufficient, sell this and devote the proceeds to supplying the deficiency; if they are sufficient, you may give it to whatever monk you please.” The combined offerings proved sufficient for the householder’s purpose; there was nothing lacking. The lay disciple therefore said to the men, “Honorable Sirs, this yellow robe, given by a certain householder for such and such a purpose, is superfluous. To whom shall we give it?”*";
P_HTM[331]="***Some said, “Let us give it to the Elder Sāriputta.” Others said, “The Elder Sāriputta has a way of coming and going when the crops are ripe. But Devadatta is our constant companion, both on festival days and on ordinary days, and is ever ready like a water-pot. Let us give it to him.” After a long discussion it was decided by a majority of four to give the robe to Devadatta. So they gave the robe to Devadatta. Devadatta cut it in two, fashioned it, dyed it, put one part on as an undergarment and the other as an upper garment, and wore it as he walked about. When they saw him wearing his new robe, they said, “This robe does not become Devadatta, but does become the Elder Sāriputta. Devadatta is going about wearing under and upper garments which do not become him.”*";
P_HTM[332]="***Now a certain monk who lived in foreign parts came from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, and when he had paid obeisance to the Teacher and expressed his pleasure at seeing him, the Teacher asked him about the well-being of the two Chief Disciples. The monk thereupon told him the whole episode of the robe from beginning to end. Said the Teacher, “Monks, this is not the first time Devadatta has worn robes unbecoming to him; in a previous state of existence also he wore robes which did not become him.” So saying, he related the following*";
P_HTM[333]="***7 a. Story of the Past: The elephant-hunter and the noble elephant*";
P_HTM[334]="***Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benāres, there dwelt at Benāres a certain elephant-hunter who made a living by killing elephants and marketing their tusks, claws, entrails, and solid flesh. Now in a certain forest several thousand elephants found pasture. One day, when they went to the forest, they saw some Private Buddhas. From that day, both going and coming, they fell down on their knees before the Private Buddhas before proceeding on their way.*";
P_HTM[335]="***One day the elephant-hunter saw their actions. Thought he, “It is only with great difficulty that I can kill these beasts. But every time they come and go they pay obeisance to the Private Buddhas. What is it they see that makes them pay obeisance?” Coming to the conclusion that it was the yellow robe, he thought to himself, “I too ought to get a yellow robe immediately.” So he went to a pool used by a certain Private Buddha, and while the latter was bathing and his robes lay on the bank, stole his robes. Then he went and sat down on the path by which the elephants came and went, with a spear in his hand and the robe drawn over his head. The elephants saw him, and taking him for a Private Buddha, paid obeisance to him, and then went their way. The elephant which came last of all he killed with a thrust of his spear. And taking the tusks and other parts which were of value and burying the rest of the dead animal in the ground, he departed.*";
P_HTM[336]="***Later on the Future Buddha, who had been reborn as an elephant, became the leader of the elephants and the lord of the herd. At that time also the elephant-hunter was pursuing the same tactics as before. The Great Being observed the diminution of his retinue and asked, “Where do these elephants go that this herd has become so small?” “That we do not know, master.” The Great Being thought to himself, “Wherever they go, they must not go without my permission.” Then the suspicion entered his mind, “The fellow who sits in a certain place with a yellow robe drawn over his head must be causing the trouble; he will bear watching,”*";
P_HTM[337]="***So the leader of the herd sent the other elephants on ahead and brought up the rear himself, walking very slowly. When the rest of the elephants had paid obeisance and passed on, the elephant-hunter saw the Great Being approach, whereupon he gathered his robe together and threw his spear. The Great Being fixed his attention as he approached, and stepping backwards, avoided the spear. “This is the man who killed my elephants,” thought the Great Being, and forthwith sprang forwards to seize him. But the elephant-hunter jumped behind a certain tree and crouched down. Thought the Great Being, “I will encircle both the hunter and the tree with my trunk, seize the hunter, and dash him to the ground.” Just at that moment the hunter removed the yellow robe and allowed the elephant to see it. When the Great Being saw it, he thought to himself, “If I offend against this man, the reverence which thousands of Buddhas, Private Buddhas, and Arahats feel towards me will of necessity be lost.” Therefore he kept his patience. Then he asked the hunter, “Was it you that killed all these kinsmen of mine?” “Yes, master,” replied the hunter. “Why did you do so wicked a deed? You have put on robes which become those who are free from the passions, but which are unbecoming to you. In doing such a deed as this, you have committed a grievous sin.” So saying, he rebuked him again for the last time, saying,*";
P_HTM[338]="***Whoever, not free from impurity, lacking self-restraint and truth,*";
P_HTM[339]="***Puts on the yellow robe, he is not worthy of the yellow robe.*";
P_HTM[340]="***Whoever is free from impurity, firmly established in the moral precepts,*";
P_HTM[341]="***Possessed of self-restraint and truth, he is worthy of the yellow robe.*";
P_HTM[342]="***“Unbecoming is the deed you have done,” said he.*";
P_HTM[343]="***When the Teacher had ended this lesson, he identified the characters in the Jātaka as follows, “At that time the elephant-hunter was Devadatta, and the noble elephant who rebuked him was I myself. Monks, this is not the first time Devadatta has worn a robe which was unbecoming to him; he did the same thing in a previous state of existence also.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[344]="***9. Whoever, not free from impurity, lacking self-restraint and truth,*";
P_HTM[345]="***Puts on the yellow robe, he is not worthy of the yellow robe.*";

P_HTM[352]="***They attain the goal of truth and abide in the pasture-ground of right thinking.*";
P_HTM[353]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana, and it was with reference to the announcement made by the Chief Disciples of Sañjaya’s refusal to go to the Teacher. From first to last the story is as follows:*";
P_HTM[354]="***8 a. Life of the Buddha*";
P_HTM[355]="***Four Incalculables and a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past our Teacher was born as a Brahman prince in the city of Amaravatī, and his name was Sumedha. After acquiring proficiency in all the arts, he renounced wealth amounting to countless millions which he inherited on the death of his mother and father, retired from the world, adopted the life of an anchorite, took up his residence in the Himālaya country, and there won for himself by Ecstatic Meditation the Supernatural Powers. Now it came to pass on a certain day that Dīpaṅkara, Master of the Ten Forces, set out from Sudassana monastery to go to the city Ramma, and the populace came forth to clear the way. As Sumedha came flying through the air on that day, he observed that a road was being cleared. Therefore selecting for himself a portion of the road which had not yet been cleared, when the Teacher approached, he made of himself a bridge for him, spread his mantle of antelope skin in the mud, laid himself thereon, and said, “Let not the Teacher with his company of disciples tread upon the mud. Let him rather tread upon me; so let him proceed upon his journey.”*";
P_HTM[356]="***When the Teacher beheld Sumedha, he said, “Yonder prince is a nascent Buddha; four Incalculables and a hundred thousand cycles of time hence he will become a Buddha named Gotama.” Thus did the Teacher Dīpaṅkara prophesy regarding the Brahman prince Sumedha. After Dīpaṅkara came the following Buddhas: Koṇḍañña, Maṅgala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Nārada, Padumuttara, Sumedha, Sujāta, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī, Siddhattha, Tissa, Phussa, Vipassī, Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. One after another these twenty-four Buddhas arose in the world and enlightened the world, and from each of them the Brahman prince Sumedha received the prophecy that he should one day become a Buddha. Now after Sumedha had fulfilled the Ten Perfections and the Ten Minor Perfections and the Ten Major Perfections, making in all Thirty Perfections, he was reborn as Vessantara; and in his existence as Vessantara he bestowed mighty alms which caused the earth to quake, and in that existence also he renounced both son and wife. When the term of life allotted to him was come to an end, he was reborn in the Heaven of the Tusita gods; and when he had remained in this state of existence during the term of life allotted to him, the deities of the Ten Thousand Worlds assembled together and thus addressed him,*";
P_HTM[357]="***The time is come, mighty hero; descend into the womb of your mother;*";
P_HTM[358]="***Rescue the worlds of men and gods; discover the Region of the Deathless.*";
P_HTM[359]="***Thereupon he made the Five Great Observations, and passing from that state of existence, received a new existence in the royal household of the Sākiyas. In this royal household he was brought up amid great splendor and in the course of time attained auspicious youth. He spent his youth in three mansions appropriate to the three seasons of the year, enjoying splendor and majesty of sovereignty comparable to the splendor of the World of the Gods. In the course of time it came to pass that, as he proceeded on three successive days to the garden to amuse himself, he beheld the Three Heavenly Messengers; namely, a man worn out by old age, a man afflicted with disease, and a dead man. On each of the three days he returned to his palace, overcome with emotion.*";
P_HTM[360]="***On the fourth day he beheld a man who had retired from the world and adopted the life of a monk. “It were well for me to retire from the world and adopt the life of a monk,” said he, conceiving a desire for the religious life; and with this thought in mind, he proceeded to the garden and spent the entire day sitting on the bank of the royal pool. While he sat there, the god Vissakamma approached him, disguised as a barber, and dressed him in rich apparel and adorned him with all manner of adornments. There also he received the message that a son had been born to him, Prince Rāhula; and realizing the strength of affection for a son, he reflected, “I must straightway break this bond, lest it become too strong for me.” In the evening, as he entered the city, Kisā Gotamī, daughter of his father’s sister, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[361]="***Happy indeed is that mother, happy indeed is that father,*";
P_HTM[362]="***Happy indeed is that wife whose husband is such a one as he.*";
P_HTM[363]="***When he heard Kisā Gotamī pronounce this Stanza, he said, “This woman has taught me where true happiness is to be found;” and taking off a string of pearls, he sent it to her as a present. Having entered his own residence, he lay down on the royal couch, and as he lay there beheld the disgusting appearance of the nautch-girls asleep. Heartsick he roused his courtier Channa, caused his steed Kanthaka to be brought to him, mounted Kanthaka, and taking Channa with him as his companion, and surrounded by the deities of the Ten Thousand Worlds, he went forth and made the Great Retirement. Proceeding to the bank of the river Anoma, he retired from the world and adopted the life of a monk.*";
P_HTM[364]="***Having adopted the life of a monk, he proceeded to Rājagaha and went about the city receiving alms. Then he retired to Paṇḍava mountain and seated himself in Paṇḍava mountain cave. While he was sitting there, the king of Magadha came to him and offered to bestow his kingdom upon him, but this offer of the king he straightway refused. He promised the king, however, to visit his kingdom so soon as he should attain Omniscience. Then he approached Āḷāra and Uddaka; but after following their system of discipline, failed to win the Attainment which distinguishes one who has attained Arahatship. Thereafter, for a period of six years, he engaged in the Great Struggle.*";
P_HTM[365]="***Early in the morning on the day of full moon of the month Visākhā he ate rice-porridge presented to him by Sujāta, caused his golden bowl to float on the river Nerañjarā, and spent the day in Mahāvana Grove in the various degrees of Ecstatic Meditation. In the evening he listened to the praise of his noble qualities bestowed upon him by Kāḷa, King of the Dragons, ascended the Throne of Wisdom, received the bundles of grass presented to him by Sotthiya, scattered the grass before him, and formed the following resolution, “I will not abandon this posture until I have ceased utterly to care for the things of this world and my heart has thus rid itself of the Depravities.”*";
P_HTM[366]="***Thereupon he sat down facing the east, and before the sun had set overcame the host of Māra. In the first watch he acquired the knowledge of previous states of existence; in the second watch he acquired the knowledge of the vanishing of creatures from one state of existence and of their reappearance in another; at the conclusion of the last watch he acquired the knowledge of the Causes of Existence, fathoming the depths of Omniscience and acquiring the Ten Forces, the Four Subjects of Confidence, and all of the Noble Qualities. For seven weeks he remained on the Throne of Wisdom; in the eighth week he seated himself under the Goatherd’s Banyan-tree and meditated upon the depths of the Law, finally arriving at misgivings as to his ability to preach the Law to others.*";
P_HTM[367]="***Straightway Sahampati Brahmā, accompanied by the retinue of the Ten Thousand Worlds with which Mahā Brahmā is wont to be accompanied, approached him and requested him to preach the Law to others. Surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha, he acceded to Brahmā’s request. “To whom, pray, shall I first preach the Law?” thought he. Surveying the world, he became aware of the death of Āḷāra and Uddaka. But remembering the devoted services of the Five Monks, he arose from his seat and went to Kāsipura, meeting Upaka by the way and talking with him.*";
P_HTM[368]="***On the day of full moon of the month Āsāḷha he arrived at Isipatana in the Deerpark, at the place of residence of the Five Monks; and when the Five Monks addressed him improperly, he instructed them how properly to address him. Then he set in motion the Wheel of the Law, giving to drink of the Deathless to a hundred and eighty millions of angels, but above all to the monk Añña-Koṇḍañña. Having set in motion the glorious Wheel of the Law, on the fifth day of the half-month he established all those monks in Arahatship. On the same day also he perceived that the noble youth Yasa possessed the dispositions requisite for Conversion; and when the noble youth Yasa left his house in disgust at what he saw during the night, he saw him and summoned him and made a monk of him, saying, “Come, Yasa!” In that same night also he caused him to attain the Fruit of Conversion, and on the following day caused him to attain Arahatship. Afterwards he made monks of his fifty-four companions, employing the formula, “Come, monks!” And having made monks of them, he caused them to attain Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[369]="***There were thus sixty-one Arahats in the world. Having kept residence during the season of the rains, and having celebrated the terminal festival , he sent out the sixty monks into all the world, saying, “Go forth, monks, preaching and teaching.” He himself proceeded to Uruvelā, on the way thither, in Kappāsika grove, instructing the Thirty Youths known as the Bhaddavaggiyas. Of these the least attained the Fruit of Conversion and the greatest attained the Fruit of the Third Path. All these youths he received into the Order with the single formula, “Come, monks!” And when he had so done, he sent them out into all the world. Arriving at Uruvelā, he performed three thousand five hundred miracles and converted Uruvelā-Kassapa, Nadī-Kassapa, and Gayā-Kassapa. These were three brothers, ascetics who wore matted hair, with a following of a thousand disciples. These ascetics he instructed in the Law. And when he had so done, he received them into the Order with the single formula, “Come, monks!” Seating them at Gayāsīsa, he established them in Arahatship by preaching the Fire Sermon; then, attended by a thousand Arahats, he went to Latthivana Garden near the city of Rājagaha, intending to redeem the promise he had given to King Bimbisāra.*";
P_HTM[370]="***“The Teacher has arrived,” went forth the cry. Hearing the report, King Bimbisāra approached with twelve nahutas of Brahman householders, and to him the Buddha preached the Law in a pleasing manner, establishing the king and eleven nahutas of Brahmans in the Fruit of Conversion and one nahuta of Brahmans in the Refuges. On the following day he listened to the praise of his noble qualities by Sakka king of the gods disguised as a Brahman youth, and then entered the city of Rājagaha. Having eaten his meal in the royal residence, he accepted the gift of Veḷuvana monastery and took up his residence there. And there it was that Sāriputta and Moggallāna came to him.*";
P_HTM[371]="***8 b. Life of Upatissa (Sāriputta) and Kolita (Moggallāna)*";
P_HTM[372]="***Before the Buddha appeared in the world, there were two Brahman villages not far from Rājagaha named Upatissa village and Kolita village. One day a Brahman’s wife named Rūpasārī, who lived in Upatissa village, conceived a child in her womb; and on the same day a Brahman’s wife named Moggalī, who lived in Kolita village, likewise conceived a child in her womb. We are told that for seven generations these two families had been firmly knit and bound together in the bonds of friendship; they performed the Protection of the Embryo for the two expectant mothers on the same day. On the expiration of ten lunar months, both women gave birth to sons.*";
P_HTM[373]="***On the day appointed for the naming of the children, they gave the name Upatissa to the son of the Brahman woman whose name was Sārī, because he was the son of the principal family in Upatissa village; to the other boy, because he was the son of the principal family in Kolita village, they gave the name Kolita. As they grew up, both boys attained the highest proficiency in all the arts and sciences. Whenever the youth Upatissa went to the river or the garden to disport himself, five hundred golden litters accompanied him; five hundred chariots drawn by thoroughbreds accompanied the youth Kolita. The two youths had retinues of five hundred boys apiece.*";
P_HTM[374]="***Now there is a festival celebrated every year in Rājagaha which goes by the name of Mountain-top festival. A couch for the two youths was set up in one place, and the two youths sat together and witnessed the passing show. When there was occasion to laugh, they laughed; when there was occasion to weep, they wept; when it was time to give alms, they gave alms. In this way they witnessed the festivities for several days. But one day, when they had grown wiser, there was no laugh when they might have laughed, as on preceding days, there were no tears when they might have wept, and when their alms were sought they gave no alms.*";
P_HTM[375]="***The following thought, we are told, occurred to the two youths, “Why should we look at this? Before a hundred years have passed, all these people will have gone hence and will no more be seen. It behooves us rather to seek the Way of Release.” And taking this thought to heart, they sat down. Then Kolita said to Upatissa, “Friend Upatissa, you do not appear to be pleased and delighted as on previous days. Nay rather, you are afflicted with melancholy. What is in your mind?” “Friend Kolita, I sit thinking, ‘There is no lasting satisfaction in looking upon these folk; this is all unprofitable; it behooves me rather to seek the Way of Release for myself.’ ‘But why are you melancholy?” Kolita said the same thing. When Upatissa discovered that Kolita’s thoughts were one with his own, he said, “Both of us have had a happy thought. It behooves us both to seek the Way of Release and to retire from the world together. Under what teacher shall we retire from the world?”*";
P_HTM[376]="***Now at this time a wandering ascetic named Sañjaya entered the city of Rājagaha, accompanied by a large retinue of wandering ascetics. “We will retire from the world and become monks under Sañjaya,” said Upatissa and Kolita. So they dismissed five hundred retainers, saying to them, “Take the litters and the chariots and go,” and together with the remaining five hundred, retired from the world and became monks under Sañjaya. From the day when these two youths retired from the world and became monks under Sañjaya, Sañjaya reached the pinnacle of gain and renown. In but a few days they had passed the bounds of Sañjaya’s teaching. Therefore they asked him, “Teacher, is this all the religious truth you know, or is there something more besides?” “This is all there is; you know all.”*";
P_HTM[377]="***Upatissa and Kolita thought to themselves, “If this is the case, it is profitless for us to remain pupils of this teacher any longer. The Way of Release we retired from the world to seek for, we certainly cannot obtain from this teacher. But the Land of the Rose-apple is an extensive country. Let us journey through villages, market-towns, and royal cities. We shall surely find some teacher who will expound to us the Way of Release.” From that time forth, wherever they heard there was a learned monk or Brahman, they went to him and held converse with him. The questions Upatissa and Kolita asked, the others were not able to answer; but every question the others asked, Upatissa and Kolita answered. In this manner they traveled all over the Land of the Rose-apple; then they retraced their steps and returned to their own homes again. Before they separated, Upatissa said to Kolita, “Friend Kolita, whichever of us first attains the Deathless is to inform the other.” Having made this agreement, they separated.*";
P_HTM[378]="***While they were living under this agreement, the Teacher, after traveling from place to place as has been related above, arrived at Rājagaha, accepted the gift of Veḷuvana monastery, and took up his residence at Veḷuvana. Now after the Teacher had sent forth the sixty-one Arahats to proclaim the virtues of the Three Jewels, saying, “Go forth, monks, preaching and teaching,” one of the Band of Five, the Great Elder Assaji, turned back, came to Rājagaha, and on the following day, early in the morning, taking his bowl and his robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. On the same day, early in the morning, the wandering ascetic Upatissa ate his breakfast, and proceeding to the hermitage of the wandering ascetics, saw the Elder. When he saw him, he thought to himself, “Never before have I seen a monk like this monk. He must be one of those monks who have attained Arahatship in this world, or who have entered upon the path leading to Arahatship. Suppose I were to approach this monk and ask him, ‘For whose sake, brother, have you retired from the world? And who is your teacher? And whose doctrine do you profess?’ ” Then this thought occurred to him, “It is not the proper time to ask this monk questions, for he is going from house to house for alms. Suppose I were to follow close in the footsteps of this monk, as those are wont to do who seek some favor?”*";
P_HTM[379]="***Therefore, observing that the monk had received a portion of alms and was on his way to a certain place, and perceiving that he desired to sit down, he placed his own monk’s stool on the ground and offered it to him; and when the monk had finished his meal, offered him water from his own water-pot. Having thus performed the duties of a pupil to a teacher, he exchanged pleasant greetings with the Elder after the meal was over and said to him, “Calm and serene, brother, are your organs of sense; clean and clear is the hue of your skin. For whose sake, brother, did you retire from the world? And who is your teacher? And whose doctrine do you profess?”*";
P_HTM[380]="***The Elder thought to himself, “These wandering ascetics are hostile to the religion I profess; therefore I will show this monk the profundity of our religion.” But first he explained that he was himself a mere novice, saying, “Brother, I am as yet a mere novice; no long time have I been a monk; but recently did I approach this Doctrine and Discipline; just now I shall not be able to expound the Law at length.” Thought the wandering ascetic, “I am Upatissa; say much or little according to your ability; I will undertake to fathom the meaning in a hundred ways or a thousand ways.” Therefore he said,*";
P_HTM[381]="***Say little or much; tell me the substance only;*";
P_HTM[382]="***I have need of the substance only; why utter many words?*";
P_HTM[383]="***In response the Elder pronounced the first line of the Stanza,*";
P_HTM[384]="***Of all things that proceed from a cause,*";
P_HTM[385]="***of these the cause the Tathāgata hath told.*";
P_HTM[386]="***So soon as the wandering ascetic heard the first line, he was established in the Fruit of Conversion, perfect in a thousand ways. So soon as he was established in the Fruit of Conversion, the Elder completed the second line,*";
P_HTM[387]="***And also how these cease to be,*";
P_HTM[388]="***this too the mighty monk hath told.*";
P_HTM[389]="***But after he had attained the Fruit of Conversion, the Higher Excellence failed to appear. Therefore he considered, “There must be a reason for this,” and said to the Elder, “Do not carry your teaching of the Law any further; let this suffice. Where does our Teacher reside?” “At Veḷuvana, brother.” “Well then, Reverend Sir, you go on ahead. I have a friend, and he and I made the following agreement with each other, ‘Whichever of us first attains the Deathless is to inform the other.’ I wish first to redeem this promise. I will bring my friend with me and go to the Teacher, following the same path you take.” So saying, Upatissa prostrated himself before the feet of the Elder with the Five Rests, walked thrice around him sunwise, and then took leave of him and went to meet the leader of the wandering ascetics.*";
P_HTM[390]="***The wandering ascetic Kolita saw him approaching from afar and said to himself, “To-day my friend’s face has a hue not as on other days; it must be that he has attained the Deathless.” Therefore he asked him at once whether he had attained the Deathless. Upatissa said in reply, “Yes, brother, I have attained the Deathless.” So saying, he pronounced the same Stanza Assaji had pronounced. At the conclusion of the Stanza Kolita was established in the Fruit of Conversion. Thereupon Kolita said, “Friend, where does our Teacher reside?” “At Veḷuvana, friend. So I was informed by our teacher the Elder Assaji.” “Well then, friend, let us go; let us see the Teacher.”*";
P_HTM[391]="***Now it was a distinguishing trait of the Elder Sāriputta that he always held a teacher in profound respect. Therefore said he to his friend, “Friend, let us inform our teacher, the wandering ascetic Sañjaya, that we have attained the Deathless. Thus will his mind be awakened, and he will comprehend. But should he fail to comprehend, he will at any rate believe what we say to be true; and so soon as he has listened to the preaching of the Buddhas, he will attain the Path and the Fruit.” Accordingly the two wandering ascetics went to Sañjaya. When Sañjaya saw them, he asked, “Friends, did you succeed in finding anyone able to show you the Way to the Deathless?” “Yes, teacher, such a one have we found. The Buddha has appeared in the world, the Law has appeared, the Order has appeared. You, sir, are walking in vain unreality. Come, sir, let us go to the Teacher.” “You may go; I cannot go.” “For what reason?” “In the past I have gone about as a teacher of the multitude. For me to become a pupil again would be as absurd as for a chatty to go to the well. I shall not be able to live the life of a pupil.”*";
P_HTM[392]="***“Do not act thus, teacher.” “Never mind, friends, you may go, but I cannot go.” “Teacher, from the moment of the Buddha’s appearance in the world the populace will take perfumes, garlands, and so forth in their hands and will go and do honor to him alone. Let us also go there. What do you intend to do?” “Friends, which are more numerous in this world, the stupid or the wise?” “Teacher, the stupid are many, the wise are few.” “Well then, friends, let the wise men go to the wise monk Gotama, and let the stupid come to stupid me. You may go, but I shall not go.” “You will become a famous man, teacher!” said his two former pupils, and departed. As they departed, Sañjaya’s congregation broke up; at that instant the grove was empty. When Sañjaya saw that the grove was empty, he vomited hot blood. Five hundred wandering ascetics accompanied the two on their journey a little way. Of these, two hundred and fifty remained loyal to Sañjaya and turned back; the other two hundred and fifty wandering ascetics the two received as their own pupils and took with them to Veḷuvana.*";
P_HTM[393]="***As the Teacher sat in the midst of the fourfold congregation preaching the Law, he saw the two wandering ascetics approaching from afar. Straightway he addressed the monks, “Monks, here come two friends, Kolita and Upatissa. They will become my pair of disciples, my chief and noble pair.” The two wandering ascetics paid obeisance to the Teacher, sat down respectfully on one side, and spoke thus to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, we should like to receive admission to the Order at the hands of the Exalted One; we should like to make our full profession.” Said the Exalted One, “Come, monks! The Law has been well taught. Lead the holy life, to the end that all suffering may be utterly done away.” Instantly they became possessed of bowls and robes created by supernatural power, and became as it were Elders of a hundred years’ residence.*";
P_HTM[394]="***By the acts of the company of his disciples the Teacher caused the preaching of the Law constantly to increase. With the exception of the two Chief Disciples all attained Arahatship. The two Chief Disciples, however, did not complete the meditations leading to the Three Higher Paths. (What was the reason for this? It was because of the magnitude of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples.)*";
P_HTM[395]="***Now Venerable Moggallāna the Great, residing near the village Kallavāḷa in the kingdom of Magadha, fell into sloth and torpor on the seventh day after the day of his reception into the Order. But aroused by the Teacher, he shook off sloth and torpor, and applying himself to the Formula of Meditation on the Elements given him by the Tathāgata, completed the meditations leading to the Three Higher Paths and attained the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples.*";
P_HTM[396]="***As for the Elder Sāriputta, he spent the fortnight following his reception into the Order with the Teacher, residing at Sūkarakhata Cave near the same city Rājagaha. Having heard an exposition of the Vedanāpariggaha Suttanta by his own sister’s son, the wandering monk Dīghanakha, he applied his mind to the Sutta, and like a man who eats rice boiled for another man, attained the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples.*";
P_HTM[397]="***(Surely the Venerable Sāriputta is a man of great intelligence. Why, then, does he require a longer time than Moggallāna the Great to attain the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples? Because the preliminaries are so elaborate. We must understand that the case is analogous to that of a king, who, when he wishes to set out on a journey, is obliged to make great preparations, such as caparisoning riding-elephants. On the other hand a poor man, no matter where he may wish to go, immediately goes there without more ado.)*";
P_HTM[398]="***On the very day when Sāriputta and Moggallāna were received into the Order, as the shadows of evening lengthened, the Teacher gathered his disciples together at Veḷuvana, assigned the place of Chief Disciples to the newcomers, and then recited the Pātimokkha. The monks were offended and said, “The Teacher shows favoritism in bestowing this distinction. In bestowing the place of Chief Disciples, he ought to give the preference to those who were the first to retire from the world; namely, the Band of Five. If he disregard their claims, he ought to give the preference to the Elder Yasa and his Fifty-four Companions. If he disregard their claims, he ought to give the preference to the Thirty Youths. If he disregard their claims, he ought to give the preference to the Three Brothers, Uruvelā-Kassapa, Nadī-Kassapa, and Gayā-Kassapa. In rejecting the prior claims of all these monks and giving the place of Chief Disciples to those who retired from the world last of all, the Teacher shows favoritism.”*";
P_HTM[399]="***The Teacher asked them, “Monks, what is the subject you are discussing?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, I show no favoritism in bestowing this distinction. On the contrary I bestow on these monks and on all others that for which each has made his Earnest Wish. For Añña-Koṇḍañña gave the first fruits of a certain crop nine times, but in so doing did not make an Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple. On the contrary, in bestowing his gift, he made the Earnest Wish that he might be the first to win the foremost estate of all; namely, Arahatship.” “When was that, Reverend Sir?” “Listen, monks.” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” Thereupon the Exalted One related the following*";
P_HTM[400]="***8 c. Story of the Past: Kāḷa junior and Kāḷa senior*";
P_HTM[401]="***Monks, ninety-one cycles of time in the past the Exalted Vipassī appeared in the world. At that time two brothers, Mahā Kāḷa and Culla Kāḷa, both of them householders, caused a great field to be planted with rice. One day Culla Kāḷa went to the rice-field, hulled a kernel of rice, and ate it, and found it unusually sweet. Shortly afterwards he desired to make a gift of unripe rice to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha. So he went to his older brother and said to him, “Brother, let us have unripe rice hulled and cooked in a manner suitable for the Buddhas, and let us bestow the same in alms.” “What say you, brother? No one has ever yet had unripe rice hulled and given in alms, nor is anyone likely to do such a thing in the future; don’t spoil the crop.”*";
P_HTM[402]="***The younger brother repeated his suggestion several times. Finally the older brother said, “Very well, divide the field into two parts. Do not touch my portion, but do whatever you like in your own portion of the field.” “Very well,” said Culla Kāḷa. So he divided the field into two parts, hired a large number of men for manual labor, caused grains of unripe rice to be hulled, had it cooked in rich milk, adding ghee, honey, and sugar, and presented the rice thus prepared to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, saying at the conclusion of the meal, “Reverend Sir, by virtue of this my gift of first-fruits may I be the first to win the foremost estate of all; namely, Arahatship.” “So be it,” said the Teacher, returning thanks. When he went back to the field and looked at it again, he saw that the entire field was filled with heads of growing rice, bound together, as it were, in sheaves. At this sight he experienced the five kinds of joy. Thought he, “I am indeed fortunate.” When the rice was in the ear, he gave first-fruits of rice in the ear. In association with the residents of the village he bestowed the first-fruits of the crop. When the rice was reaped, he gave the first-fruits of the reaping; when it was in the sheaf, the first-fruits of the sheaves; when it was in the shock, the first-fruits of the shocks; when it was in the rick, the first-fruits of the ricks; when it was threshed, the first-fruits of the threshing-floor; when it was ground, the first-fruits of the flour; when it was measured, the first-fruits of the measuring; when it was put away in the storehouse, the first-fruits of the store. Thus he bestowed the first-fruits of a single crop nine times. Whatever he took away was made up, and he had a bumper harvest. Goodness keeps him who keeps it. Therefore said the Exalted One,*";
P_HTM[403]="***Righteousness truly keeps him who keeps righteousness; righteous living brings happiness.*";
P_HTM[404]="***Herein is the advantage of living righteously, that he who walks righteously will never go to a state of suffering.*";
P_HTM[405]="***Thus, in the dispensation of the Supremely Enlightened Vipassī, did Añña-Koṇḍañña bestow the gift of first fruits nine times, making the Earnest Wish to be the first to attain the foremost of all estates. Likewise in the dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara, a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past, in the city Haṁsavatī, he gave mighty gifts, and falling at the feet of that Exalted Buddha, made the Earnest Wish to be the first to attain the foremost of all estates; namely, Arahatship. Thus I bestowed on him only that for which he made his Earnest Wish. I show no favoritism in bestowing distinction.*";
P_HTM[406]="***8 d. Story of the Past: Yasa and fifty-four companions*";
P_HTM[407]="***Reverend Sir, what work of merit did the fifty-five noble youths led by Yasa perform? – They too made an Earnest Wish for Arahatship at the feet of a certain Buddha and did many works of merit. Subsequently, but before the present Buddha had appeared in the world, they became friends, banded themselves together for the performance of works of merit, and devoted themselves to the care of the corpses of paupers. One day, seeing the dead body of a pregnant woman, they carried the body to the cemetery for the purpose of burning it. To Yasa and four of his companions was assigned the duty of burning the corpse; the rest returned and entered the village.*";
P_HTM[408]="***As the youth Yasa burned the body, piercing it with stakes and turning it over and over, he grasped the thought of the Impurity of the Body. This thought he communicated to his four companions also, saying, “Behold, brethren, this body. Here and there the skin has burst open; it resembles nothing so much as the skin of a mottled cow. It is impure, stinking, repulsive.” Straightway his four companions also grasped the thought of the Impurity of the Body. In their turn these five companions went to the village and informed the rest of their friends. As for Yasa, he went home and informed his mother and father and wife, and they all developed the thought of Impurity. This is the work of merit these youths performed in a previous state of existence. And because of this very work of merit, consciousness of the Impurity of the Body arose within Yasa’s mind in the women’s apartments. And thus, because they had acquired the faculties requisite thereto, all of them developed Specific Attainment. Therefore these youths also obtained precisely that for which they made their Earnest Wish. I show no favoritism in bestowing distinction.*";
P_HTM[409]="***8 e. Story of the Past: Thirty noble youths*";
P_HTM[410]="***But, Reverend Sir, what work of merit did the thirty noble youths perform? – They also made an Earnest Wish for Arahatship at the feet of previous Buddhas and performed works of merit. Subsequently, but before the present Buddha appeared in the world, they were reborn as thirty evildoers; but hearing the admonition addressed to Tuṇḍila, they kept the Five Precepts for sixty thousand years. Thus these men also obtained only that for which they made their Earnest Wish. I show no favoritism in bestowing distinction.*";
P_HTM[411]="***8 f. Story of the Past: Three brothers Kassapa*";
P_HTM[412]="***But, Reverend Sir, what work of merit was performed by the three brothers Kassapa: Uruvelā-Kassapa, Nadī-Kassapa, and Gayā-Kassapa? – They also performed works of merit, making an Earnest Wish to attain Arahatship. Ninety-two cycles of time in the past, two Buddhas appeared in the world at the same time, Tissa and Phussa; Phussa’s father was King Mahinda. When Phussa attained Enlightenment, the king’s youngest son became his Chief Disciple, and the son of the house-priest became his Second Disciple. The king went to the Teacher and said, “My oldest son is the Buddha, my youngest son is Chief Disciple, and the son of my house-priest is Second Disciple.” And looking upon the three, he said, “My very own is the Buddha, my very own is the Law, my very own is the Order.” And thrice he breathed forth the Solemn Utterance, “Praise be unto Him that is Highly Exalted, All-Worthy, Supremely Enlightened.” Then he prostrated himself before the feet of the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, now, at the end of a life lasting ninety thousand years, it is time, as it were, for me to sit down and close my eyes in slumber. So long as I live, go not to the door of others’ houses, but receive the Four Requisites from me alone.” Having thus obtained the Teacher’s consent, the king thereafter ministered to him regularly.*";
P_HTM[413]="***Now the king had three other sons besides, the eldest of whom had a retinue of five hundred soldiers, the middlemost three, and the youngest two. One day they sought permission of their father to entertain their brother, the Buddha Phussa, but failed to obtain it. This happened many times. Shortly afterwards an insurrection broke out on the frontier, and they were sent to suppress it. Succeeding in restoring order on the frontier, they returned to their father. Their father embraced them, kissed their heads, and said to them, “Dear sons, I grant you whatever you desire.” “Very well, your majesty,” said they, accepting his offer. When, after a few days, their father again said, “Dear sons, I grant you whatever you desire,” they replied, “Your majesty, we desire naught else but only this, that henceforth we may entertain our brother; grant us this boon.” “I will not grant you this boon, dear sons.” “If you are unwilling to grant us this privilege permanently, then grant it to us for seven years.” “That will I not, dear sons.” “Well then, grant us the privilege for six years, or five, or four, or three, or two years, or for one year; or for seven months, or six, or five, or four, or three, or two months, or for one month.” “That will I not, dear sons.” “Well then, your majesty, make it one month for each of us; grant us this privilege for three months in all.” “Very well, dear sons; then entertain your brother for three months.”*";
P_HTM[414]="***Now all three brothers had a single treasurer and a single steward, the latter of whom had a retinue of twelve nahutas of serving-men. The three brothers summoned the treasurer and the steward and said to them, “During the coming three months we shall take upon ourselves the Ten Precepts, put on yellow robes, and reside with the Teacher. In our absence it will be your duty to administer the alms; every day you are to provide all the food, both hard and soft, for ninety thousand monks and a thousand soldiers. From henceforth we shall have nothing at all to say.” So the three brothers took their retinue of a thousand men,’ took upon themselves the Ten Precepts, put on yellow robes, and began residence in the monastery.*";
P_HTM[415]="***The treasurer and the steward joined forces and performed the duty of almsgiving by turns, taking provisions from the storehouses of the three brothers and bestowing them in alms. But when the children of the serving-men cried for rice-porridge and other kinds of food, the treasurer and the steward would give them what they cried for, even before the Congregation of Monks arrived. The result was that the Congregation of Monks received only what was left over at the end of a meal, and not a fresh supply of food at all. Finally the treasurer and the steward became so greedy that they would take food, and pretending that they were going to give it to the children, eat it themselves. The mere sight of the pleasing food they were unable to resist. They and their associates numbered eighty-four thousand men. Because they ate food which it was their duty to give to the Congregation of Monks, when they died and their bodies were dissolved, they were reborn in the World of Ghosts.*";
P_HTM[416]="***When the three brothers and their thousand men died, they were reborn in the World of the Gods and spent ninety-two cycles of time in passing from one celestial world to another. Thus did those three brothers perform works of merit at that time, making the Earnest Wish to attain Arahatship. What they received was only that for which they made their Earnest Wish. I show no favoritism in giving what I give. (Now at that time their steward was Bimbisāra, their treasurer was the lay disciple Visākha, and the three royal princes were the three ascetics of the matted locks.)*";
P_HTM[417]="***Their serving-men, reborn at that time among the ghosts, after passing from one state of existence to another, both good and evil, were reborn in this present world-cycle in the World of the Ghosts for the space of four Buddha-intervals. In this present world-cycle they approached first of all the Exalted Kakusandha, whose term of life was forty thousand years, and asked him, “Tell us when we shall obtain something to eat.” He replied, “You will receive nothing to eat in my time; but after me the great earth will be elevated a league, and the Buddha Koṇāgamana will appear; you had best ask him.” They waited all that time, and when the Buddha Koṇāgamana appeared, asked him. He replied, “You will receive nothing to eat in my time; but after me the great earth will be elevated a league, and the Buddha Kassapa will appear; you had best ask him.” They waited all that time, and when the Buddha Kassapa appeared, asked him. He replied, “You will receive nothing to eat in my time; but after me the great earth will be elevated a league, and the Buddha Gotama will appear. At that time your kinsman Bimbisāra will be king; he will give alms to the Teacher and will make over to you the merit acquired by that act; at that time you will receive something to eat.”*";
P_HTM[418]="***The length of the period intervening between two Buddhas was to them as the morrow. When the Tathāgata appeared in the world and King Bimbisāra gave alms on the first day and they failed to receive the fruit thereof, they waited until it was night, and then made a fearful noise and showed themselves to the king. When the king went to Veḷuvana on the following day, he related the incident to the Tathāgata. Said the Teacher, “Great king, ninety-two cycles of time in the past, in the dispensation of the Buddha Phussa, these ghosts were kinsmen of yours. They ate food which it was their duty to give to the Congregation of Monks, and because of this were reborn in the World of Ghosts. Passing through the round of existences, they asked the Buddhas Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa when they should obtain food, and the Buddhas told them this and that. All this time they desired greatly to receive your alms; and the reason why they acted as they did last night was that, when you gave alms, they failed to receive the fruit thereof.” “But, Reverend Sir, in case I were to give alms now, would they receive the fruit thereof?” “Yes, great king.”*";
P_HTM[419]="***On the following day the king invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, bestowed abundant offerings, and said, “Reverend Sir, henceforth may celestial food and drink be the portion of these ghosts.” And when he had thus transferred to the ghosts the merit of his offering, they received celestial food and drink. On the following day the ghosts made their appearance naked. Said the king to the Buddha, “To-day, Reverend Sir, these ghosts made their appearance naked,” and asked him what he should do. Said the Teacher, “Great king, you did not give them clothes.” So on the following day the king presented robes to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, saying, “Henceforth may they possess celestial raiment.” And when he had thus made over to them the merit of his offering, instantly they became possessed of celestial raiment, whereupon they put off their ghostly forms and took on the forms of celestial beings. When the Teacher returned thanks, he said, “Without the walls they stand,” reciting the extra-mural formula. At the conclusion of his words of thanksgiving eighty-four thousand living beings obtained Comprehension of the Law. Thus did the Teacher expound the Law, relating the story of the three brothers of the matted locks.*";
P_HTM[420]="***8 g. Story of the Past: Sarada and Sirivaḍḍha*";
P_HTM[421]="***But, Reverend Sir, what work of merit did the Chief Disciples perform? – They made their Earnest Wish to attain the station of Chief Disciples. For an Incalculable of cycles of time and a hundred thousand cycles of time additional in the past, Sāriputta was reborn in the family of a Brahman of great wealth, and his name was Prince Sarada. Moggallāna was reborn in the family of a householder of great wealth, and his name was Householder Sirivaḍḍha. The two youths were friends from the time when they played in the dirt together.*";
P_HTM[422]="***Prince Sarada came into a large family-inheritance on the death of his father. One day, when he was alone by himself, he thought, “I have certain knowledge of the life of this world only; I know nothing of the life of the world beyond. All they that are born are certain to die. I ought to retire from the world, enter some Order, and seek the Way of Release.” Therefore he approached his friend and said, “Friend Sirivaḍḍha, it is my intention to retire from the world and seek the Way of Release. Can you, or can you not, retire from the world with me?” “Friend, I cannot retire from the world; you alone retire from the world.” Prince Sarada thought to himself, “No one ever yet went to the world beyond with companions or kinsmen or friends. What one does, he must do by himself.”*";
P_HTM[423]="***Accordingly he threw open the doors of his treasure-house and bestowed abundant alms on paupers and travelers and beggars. Having so done, he retired to the foot of a certain mountain and adopted the life of an anchorite. First one, then two, then three, then many others followed his example in adopting the monastic life. Finally there were seventy-four thousand ascetics with matted locks. Sarada acquired the Five Supernatural Faculties and the Eight Higher Attainments, and taught those ascetics of the matted locks the processes necessary to the practice of Ecstatic Meditation. All of them acquired the Five Supernatural Faculties and the Eight Higher Attainments.*";
P_HTM[424]="***At this time the Buddha Anomadassī appeared in the world. His city was Candavatī. His father was Yasavanta, of the Warrior caste, and his mother was Lady Yasodharā. His Bo-tree was the ajjuna-tree. Nisabha and Anoma were his Chief Disciples, Varuṇa was his supporter, and Sundarā and Sumanā were his principal female lay disciples. His term of life was a hundred thousand years, his stature was fifty-eight cubits, and the radiance from his body flashed twelve leagues. He had a retinue of a hundred thousand monks. One day at dawn, arising from a Trance of Great Compassion, he surveyed the world and beheld the ascetic Sarada. Thereupon he became aware of the following, “To-day, through my approaching the ascetic Sarada, there will be mighty preaching of the Law. Sarada will make his Wish for the place of Chief Disciple, and his friend, Householder Sirivaḍḍha, will make his Wish for the place of Second Disciple. At the conclusion of the discourse the seventy-four thousand ascetics with matted locks who compose his retinue will attain Arahatship. Therefore it behooves me to go there.” Accordingly, taking his own bowl and robe, saying not a word to anyone else, proceeding in solitude like a lion, he commanded, “Let Sarada know that I am the Buddha.” And while the ascetic Sarada’s pupils were absent seeking various kinds of fruits, he descended from the sky and alighted on the earth before Sarada’s very eyes.*";
P_HTM[425]="***When the ascetic Sarada beheld the supernatural power of the Buddha and the perfection of form of the Buddha, he pondered in his mind the memorial verses relating to the characteristics of a great man. And he said to himself, “One endowed with these marks, if he lives the house-life, is a King, a Universal Monarch. Living the life of retirement, he is one who has rolled back the veil of passion, an Omniscient Buddha. This man is without doubt a Buddha.” Therefore he advanced to meet him, paid obeisance to him with the Five Rests, prepared a seat and offered it to him. The Exalted One seated himself in the seat prepared for him, and the ascetic Sarada, selecting a seat appropriate to himself, sat down respectfully on one side.*";
P_HTM[426]="***At that moment the seventy-four thousand ascetics of the matted locks, who had been absent gathering various kinds of sweet and juicy fruits, returned to their teacher. Seeing the Buddha seated and their own teacher seated near him, they said, “Teacher, we used to go about this world thinking to ourselves, ‘There is no one greater than you.’ But as for this man, we are certain that he is greater than you.” “Friends, what say you? Do you mean to compare a grain of mustard seed to Mount Sineru, sixty-eight thousand leagues high? Little sons, do not compare me to an Omniscient Buddha.” Then those ascetics thought to themselves, “Were this an insignificant man, our teacher would not use such a comparison as this. How great indeed must this man be!” And forthwith they fell before his feet and prostrated themselves before him.*";
P_HTM[427]="***Then their teacher said to them, “Friends, we have here no offering suitable to present to the Buddhas, and the Teacher has come here at a time when we usually go the rounds for alms; let us give him gifts according to our ability. Fetch hither all manner of fruits that are choicest.” And having thus caused them to fetch fruits, he washed his hands and himself placed the fruits in the bowl of the Tathāgata. The moment the Teacher touched the fruits which were brought, the deities imparted a celestial flavor to them. The ascetic Sarada also himself filtered water and presented it to the Teacher. After the meal was over, while the Teacher still remained seated, Sarada summoned all of his pupils, and sitting down, discoursed pleasantly with the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[428]="***Thought the Teacher to himself, “Let the two Chief Disciples approach, together with the Congregation of Monks.” Straightway those two ascetics with their retinue of a hundred thousand Arahats approached, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down respectfully on one side. Then the ascetic Sarada addressed his pupils as follows, “Friends, the seat wherein sit the Buddhas is low, and there is no seat for the hundred thousand monks. To-day you should render high honor to the Buddha. Fetch from the foot of the mountain flowers possessing bright colors and sweet perfumes.”*";
P_HTM[429]="***There is a saying, “Time occupied in talk is wasted; inconceivable is the range of magical power possessed by one endowed with supernatural power;” and so it was in this case. In but an instant those ascetics brought back flowers possessing bright colors and sweet perfumes and arranged a cushion of flowers a league long for the Buddhas. Then they arranged a cushion of flowers three gavutas long for the two Chief Disciples. The cushions for the rest of the monks were half a league long or less; those for the novices were an usabha long. It is not permissible to ask the question, “How could seats of such great size be arranged in this hermitage?” This was made possible by the power of magic. When the seats had thus been made ready, the ascetic Sarada took his stand before the Tathāgata, and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, said, “Reverend Sir, ascend this bed of flowers to my everlasting welfare and salvation.” Therefore it is said,*";
P_HTM[430]="***He gathered together various flowers and perfumes,*";
P_HTM[431]="***Prepared a bed of flowers, and spoke these words,*";
P_HTM[432]="***“Here, mighty hero, have I prepared a seat suitable for you.*";
P_HTM[433]="***Sit down on this bed of flowers, and render my heart tranquil.*";
P_HTM[434]="***“For seven nights and days the Buddha sat upon my bed of flowers.*";
P_HTM[435]="***Rendering my heart tranquil, gladdening the world of men and the Worlds of the Gods.”*";
P_HTM[436]="***While the Teacher sat thus, the two Chief Disciples with the rest of the monks sat each in the seat which had been prepared for him. The ascetic Sarada, taking a great flower-parasol, held it over the head of the Tathāgata. Said the Teacher, “May this honor rendered to me by the ascetics of the matted locks yield rich fruit.” And straightway he entered into a state of trance, attaining the Attainment of Cessation. Observing that the Teacher had attained the Attainment of Cessation, the two Chief Disciples likewise entered into a state of trance and attained the Attainment of Cessation. For seven days the Teacher sat there, enjoying the bliss of the Attainment of Cessation. When it was time to seek food, Sarada’s pupils went into the forest and ate wild fruits and other varieties of fruits. The rest of the time they stood holding out their hands in an attitude of reverent salutation before the Buddhas. The ascetic Sarada, however, went not to seek food, but for seven days continuously held the flower-parasol over the Buddha, experiencing thereby intense joy and pleasure.*";
P_HTM[437]="***When the Teacher arose from trance, he said to his Chief Disciple the Elder Nisabha, who sat on his right hand, “Nisabha, return thanks to the ascetics who have honored us with flowers and seats.” Thereupon the Elder, like a mighty warrior who has just received high distinction at the hands of a Universal Monarch, his heart filled with joy, manifesting the Perfection of Knowledge capable of attainment by a disciple, began the address of thanksgiving for the flowers and seats. At the end of the discourse the Buddha addressed the Second Disciple as follows, “Do you also preach the Law to the monks.” Thereupon the Elder Anoma, pondering the Tipiṭaka, the Word of the Buddhas, preached the Law. But although the two Chief Disciples preached the Law, not a single monk present attained Comprehension of the Law. Then the Teacher, manifesting the infinite power of a Buddha, began to preach the Law, with the result that at the conclusion of his discourse all seventy-four thousand ascetics of the matted locks attained Arahatship, with the sole exception of the ascetic Sarada. Then the Teacher stretched forth his hand and said to them, “Come, monks!” Instantly their hair and beard disappeared, and the Eight Requisites were attached to their persons.*";
P_HTM[438]="***Do you ask, “Why did not the ascetic Sarada attain Arahatship?” It was because his mind was distracted. We are told that when he seated himself in the seat of the Second Disciple of the Buddhas, and the Chief Disciple, manifesting the Perfection of Knowledge of a disciple, preached the Law, at the very moment when he began to listen to the preaching of the Law by the Chief Disciple, the following thought arose in his mind, “Oh that at some time in the future, in the dispensation of a Buddha who shall arise hereafter, I might receive the burden which this disciple has received! Because of this thought, we are told, he was unable to attain the Path and the Fruit.*";
P_HTM[439]="***Sarada, however, paid obeisance to the Tathāgata, and standing face to face with him, said, “Reverend Sir, what is the title in your Religion borne by the monk who sits in the seat next to you?” “He it is that follows me in setting in motion the Wheel of the Law which I have set in motion; he it is that has reached the pinnacle of the Perfection of Knowledge capable of attainment by a disciple; he it is that has grasped the Sixteen Forms of Knowledge; he it is that is therefore called in my Religion Chief Disciple,” “Reverend Sir, here for seven days have I stood holding the flower-parasol over you, thereby rendering honor to you. As the fruit of this work of merit, I do not wish for a second existence as Sakka or Brahmā. But at some time in the future may I become the Chief Disciple of a certain Buddha, even as is this present Elder Nisabha.”*";
P_HTM[440]="***When Sarada had made this Earnest Wish, the Teacher considered within himself, “Will the Wish of this man be fulfilled?” Therefore he sent forth his perception into the future, and surveying the ages of the future, he passed before his mind a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition; whereupon he saw that his Wish would be fulfilled. So when the Teacher saw that his Wish would be fulfilled, he said to the ascetic Sarada, “This Earnest Wish of yours will not be in vain. For at the end of a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition, Gotama Buddha will appear in the world. His mother will be Lady Mahā Māyā, his father will be King Suddhodana, his son will be Rāhula, his servitor will be Ānanda, and his Second Disciple will be Moggallāna. And you will be his Chief Disciple, the Captain of the Faith, and your name will be Sāriputta.”*";
P_HTM[441]="***When the Teacher had thus predicted the future of the ascetic, he preached the Law, and then, surrounded by his company of monks, flew up into the air and departed. The ascetic Sarada sought out the pupils and elders and sent the following message to his friend, Householder Sirivaḍḍha, “Reverend Sirs, say to my friend, ‘Your friend the ascetic Sarada fell down before the feet of the Buddha Anomadassī and made his Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple under the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama, who shall hereafter arise in the world. Do you make your Earnest Wish for the place of Second Disciple.’ ” And when he had thus spoken, he preceded the Elders by a different route and went and stood at the door of Sirivaḍḍha’s residence.*";
P_HTM[442]="***When Sirivaḍḍha saw him he said, “At last, after a long absence, my noble friend has returned.” And straightway he seated his friend in a seat, and having seated himself in a lower seat, asked him, “But, Reverend Sir, have you no pupils and attendants?” “Yes, my friend, the Buddha Anomadassī came to our hermitage, and we did him honor to the extent of our power. The Teacher preached the Law to all, and at the conclusion of his discourse all the members of our community excepting me attained Arahatship and entered the Order. When I saw the Chief Disciple of the Teacher, the Elder Nisabha, I made my Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple under the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama, who shall hereafter arise in the world. Do you also make your Earnest Wish for the place of Second Disciple under his dispensation.” “But, Reverend Sir, I am not on terms of familiar acquaintance with the Buddhas.” “I will assume the burden of talking with the Buddhas; you prepare a Great Resolve.”*";
P_HTM[443]="***When Sirivaḍḍha heard his words, he adorned a space eight karīsas in extent before the door of his residence with the respect due to a king, sprinkled sand, scattered flowers of five kinds, including lāja flowers, caused a pavilion to be erected with a thatch of blue lotuses, caused the Seat of the Buddha to be made ready, and seats for the monks also to be prepared. And having caused abundant offerings and gifts to be prepared, he directed the ascetic Sarada to invite the Buddhas. So the ascetic Sarada took the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and went with them to Sarada’s residence. Sarada advanced to meet them, took the bowl from the hand of the Tathāgata, conducted them into the pavilion, seated the Congregation of Monks on the seats prepared for them, offered them Water of Donation, and provided them with the choicest food.*";
P_HTM[444]="***At the conclusion of the meal, having clothed the Congregation of Monks with robes of great price, he said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, it was for the purpose of gaining no mean place that this entertainment was undertaken. Show your gracious compassion by remaining here in this manner for a period of seven days.” The Teacher condescended to remain. For seven days Sirivaḍḍha bestowed abundant offerings in this manner. At the end of his almsgiving he paid obeisance to the Teacher, and standing before him with hands clasped in an attitude of reverent salutation, said, “Reverend Sir, my friend the ascetic Sarada made his Earnest Wish to become Chief Disciple of a certain Teacher. May I also become the Second Disciple of that same Teacher.”*";
P_HTM[445]="***The Teacher looked into the future, and beholding the fulfillment of his Earnest Wish, made the following prophecy, “At the end of a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition, you will become the Second Disciple of Gotama Buddha.” Hearing this prophecy of the Buddhas, Sirivaḍḍha was filled with joy and satisfaction. The Teacher returned thanks for the offering of food, and then, surrounded by the company of monks, returned to the monastery. This, monks, was the Earnest Wish made by my sons at that time. They have received precisely that for which they made their Earnest Wish. When I give, I give without respect of persons. End of Stories of the Past.*";
P_HTM[446]="***When the Teacher had thus spoken, the two Chief Disciples paid obeisance to the Exalted One and said, “Reverend Sir, when we were yet householders, we went to see the festivities of Mountain-top;” and then told the entire story of the events which had recently taken place, to their attainment of the Fruit of Conversion at the hands of the Elder Assaji. Then they said, “Reverend Sir, we went to our teacher, desiring to lead him to your feet, and pointed out to him the shallowness of his own views, and dwelt upon the advantages of his coming here. But he said to us, ‘For me to try to live the life of a pupil now would be as absurd as for a chatty to go to the well. I shall not be able to live the life of a pupil.’ We replied, ‘Teacher, the populace will now take perfumes, garlands, and so forth in their hands, and will go to do honor to the Teacher alone. What do you intend to do?’ Said he, ‘Which are the more numerous in this world, the stupid or the wise?’ We replied, ‘Teacher, the stupid are many; the wise are few.’ ‘Well then,’ said he, ‘let the wise men go to the wise monk Gotama, and let the stupid come to stupid me. As for you, go where you like.’ With these words, Reverend Sir, did he refuse to come hither.”*";
P_HTM[447]="***When the Teacher heard this, he said, “Monks, by reason of the false views which he holds, Sañjaya has mistaken falsehood for truth and truth for falsehood. But you, by reason of your own wisdom, have rightly discerned that which is true in its truth and that which is false in its falsity, and you have done wisely to reject that which is false and accept that which is true.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[448]="***11. They who think to find the truth in falsehood, they who discern but falsehood in the truth,*";
P_HTM[449]="***They never attain the goal of truth, but abide in the pasture-ground of error.*";
P_HTM[450]="***12. They who have rightly discerned the true in its truth and the false in its falsity,*";
P_HTM[451]="***They attain the goal of truth and abide in the pasture-ground of right thinking.*";

P_HTM[458]="***9 a. Nanda becomes a monk in spite of himself*";
P_HTM[459]="***For after the Teacher had set in motion the glorious Wheel of the Law, he retired to Rājagaha and took up his residence at Veḷuvana. Thereupon his father, the great king Suddhodana, sent ten ambassadors to him, one after the other, each with a retinue of a thousand men, saying to them, “Fetch my son hither and show him to me before my face.” After nine ambassadors had gone thither, attained Arahatship, and failed to return, Elder Kāḷa Udāyi went thither and attained Arahatship. And knowing that it was the proper time for the Teacher to go, he described the beauties of the journey and conducted the Teacher with his retinue of twenty thousand Arahats to Kapilapura. And there, in the company of his kinsfolk, the Teacher, taking a shower of rain for his text, related the Vessantara Jātaka. On the following day he entered the city for alms. By the recitation of the Stanza, “A man should exert himself and should not live the life of Heedlessness,” he established his father in the Fruit of Conversion; and by the recitation of the Stanza, “A man should live righteously,” he established Mahā Pajāpatī in the Fruit of Conversion and his father in the Fruit of the Second Path. And at the end of the meal, with reference to the praise bestowed on him by the Mother of Rāhula, he related the Canda Kinnara Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[460]="***On the following day, while the ceremonies of Prince Nanda’s sprinkling, house-warming, and marriage were in progress, the Teacher entered the house for alms, placed his bowl in Prince Nanda’s hands, and wished him good luck. Then, rising from his seat, he departed without taking his bowl from the hands of the Prince. Out of reverence for the Tathāgata, Prince Nanda did not dare say, “Reverend Sir, receive your bowl,” but thought within himself, “He will take his bowl at the head of the stairs.” But even when the Teacher reached the head of the stairs, he did not take his bowl. Thought Nanda, “He will take his bowl at the foot of the stairs.” But the Teacher did not take his bowl even there. Thought Nanda, “He will take his bowl in the palace court.” But the Teacher did not take his bowl even there. Prince Nanda desired greatly to return to his bride, and followed the Teacher much against his own will. But so great was his reverence for the Teacher that he did not dare say, “Receive your bowl,” but continued to follow the Teacher, thinking to himself, “He will take his bowl here! he will take his bowl there! he will take his bowl there!”*";
P_HTM[461]="***At that moment they brought word to his bride Belle-of-the-Country, Janapada-Kaḷyānī, “My lady, the Exalted One has taken Prince Nanda away with him; it is his purpose to deprive you of him.” Thereupon Janapada-Kaḷyānī, with tears streaming down her face and hair half-combed, ran after Prince Nanda as fast as she could and said to him, “Noble sir, please return immediately.” Her words caused a quaver in Nanda’s heart; but the Teacher, without so much as taking his bowl, led him to the monastery and said to him, “Nanda, would you like to become a monk?” So great was Prince Nanda’s reverence for the Buddha that he refrained from saying, “I do not wish to become a monk,” and said instead, “Yes, I should like to become a monk.” Said the Teacher, “Well then, make a monk of Nanda.” Thus it happened that on the third day after the Teacher’s arrival at Kapilapura he caused Nanda to be made a monk.*";
P_HTM[462]="***On the seventh day the Mother of Rāhula adorned Prince Rāhula and sent him to the Exalted One, saying, “Dear son, go look upon this monk, possessed of a retinue of twenty thousand monks, possessed of a body of the hue of gold, possessed of the beauty of form of Mahā Brahmā. This monk is your father. To him once belonged great stores of treasure. From the time of his Great Retirement we have not seen him. Ask him for this your inheritance, saying, ‘Dear father, I am a royal prince, and so soon as I shall receive the ceremonial sprinkling, I shall become a Universal Monarch. I have need of wealth; bestow wealth upon me; for to a son belongs the wealth which formerly belonged to his father.’ ”*";
P_HTM[463]="***Accordingly Prince Rāhula went to the Exalted One. The moment he saw him he conceived a warm affection for his father, and his heart rejoiced within him. And he said, “Monk, pleasant is your shadow,” and said much else befitting his own station. When the Exalted One had finished his meal, he pronounced the words of thanksgiving, arose from his seat, and departed. Prince Rāhula followed in the footsteps of the Exalted One, saying, “Monk, give me my inheritance; monk, give me my inheritance.” The Exalted One did not repel the Prince; even the attendants were unable to prevent the Prince from accompanying the Exalted One. In this manner the Prince accompanied the Exalted One to the Grove. Then the thought occurred to the Exalted One, “The paternal inheritance which this youth seeks inevitably brings destruction in its train. Behold, I will bestow upon him the Sevenfold Noble Inheritance which I received at the foot of the Bo-tree; I will make him master of an inheritance which transcends the world.”*";
P_HTM[464]="***Therefore the Exalted One addressed Venerable Sāriputta, “Well then, Sāriputta, make a monk of Prince Rāhula.” When, however, Prince Rāhula had been received into the Order, the king his grandfather was afflicted with great sorrow. Unable to endure his sorrow, he made known his sorrow to the Exalted One and made the following request of him, “It were well, Reverend Sir, did the noble monks not receive into the Order any youth without the permission of his mother and father.” The Exalted One granted him this request. Again one day, as the Exalted One sat in the royal palace after breakfast, the king, sitting respectfully at one side, said to the Exalted One, “Reverend Sir, while you were practicing your austerities, a certain deity approached me and said to me, ‘Your son is dead.’ But I refused to believe him and replied, ‘My son will not die until he attains Enlightenment.’ ” Said the Exalted One, “Now will you believe? In a previous existence also, when a deity showed you bones and said to you, ‘Your son is dead,’ you refused to believe.” And with reference to this incident he related the Mahā Dhammapāla Jātaka. At the conclusion of the story the king was established in the Fruit of the Third Path.*";
P_HTM[465]="***9 b. Nanda and the celestial nymphs*";
P_HTM[466]="***When the Exalted One had thus established his father in the Three Fruits, he returned once more to Rājagaha, accompanied by the Congregation of Monks. Now he had promised Anāthapiṇḍika to visit Sāvatthi, so soon as the great monastery of Jetavana should be completed, and receiving word shortly afterwards that the monastery had been completed, he went to Jetavana and took up his residence there. While the Teacher was thus residing at Jetavana, Venerable Nanda, becoming discontented, told his troubles to the monks, saying, “Brethren, I am dissatisfied. I am now living the Religious Life, but I cannot endure to live the Religious Life any longer. I intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman.”*";
P_HTM[467]="***The Exalted One, hearing of this incident, sent for Venerable Nanda and said this to him, “Nanda, is the report true that you spoke as follows to a large company of monks, ‘Brethren, I am dissatisfied; I am now living the Religious Life, but I cannot endure to live the Religious Life any longer; I intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman’?” “It is quite true, Reverend Sir.” “But, Nanda, why are you dissatisfied with the Religious Life you are now living? Why cannot you endure to live the Religious Life any longer? Why do you intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman?” “Reverend Sir, when I left my house, my noble wife Janapada-Kaḷyānī, with hair half-combed, took leave of me, saying, ‘Noble sir, please return immediately.’ Reverend Sir, it is because I keep remembering her that I am dissatisfied with the religious life I am now living; that I cannot endure to live the religious life any longer; that I intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman.”*";
P_HTM[468]="***Then the Exalted One took Venerable Nanda by the arm, and by the power of his magic conducted him to the World of the Thirty-three. On the way the Exalted One pointed out to Venerable Nanda in a certain burnt field, seated on a burnt stump, a greedy monkey which had lost her ears and nose and tail in a fire. When they reached the World of the Thirty-three, he pointed out five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs who came to wait upon Sakka, king of the gods. And when the Exalted One had shown Venerable Nanda these two sights, he asked him this question, “Nanda, which do you regard as being the more beautiful and fair to look upon and handsome, your noble wife Janapada-Kaḷyānī or these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs?”*";
P_HTM[469]="***“Reverend Sir,” replied Nanda, “as far inferior as this greedy monkey which has lost her ears and nose and tail is to Janapada-Kaḷyānī, even so far inferior, Reverend Sir, is my noble wife Janapada-Kaḷyānī to these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs. In comparison with these nymphs my noble wife does not come into the count; she does not come within a fraction of them, she does not come within a fraction of a fraction of them; on the contrary, these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs are infinitely more beautiful and fair to look upon and handsome.”*";
P_HTM[470]="***“Cheer up, Nanda!” replied the Exalted One. “I guarantee that you will win these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.” Said Venerable Nanda, “If, Reverend Sir, the Exalted One guarantees that I shall win these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs, in that case, Reverend Sir, I shall take the greatest pleasure in living the exalted life of a religious.” Then the Exalted One, taking Venerable Nanda with him, disappeared from the World of the Thirty-three and reappeared at Jetavana. Now it was not long before the monks heard the following report, “It appears that it is in the hope of winning celestial nymphs that Venerable Nanda, brother of the Exalted One, son of his mother’s sister, is living the religious life; it appears that the Exalted One has guaranteed that he shall win five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.”*";
P_HTM[471]="***As a result Venerable Nanda’s fellow-monks treated him as a hireling and as one bought with a price. And they addressed him accordingly, saying, “It appears that Venerable Nanda is a hireling; it appears that Venerable Nanda is one bought with a price. It appears that it is in the hope of winning celestial nymphs that he is living the religious life; it appears that the Exalted One has guaranteed that he shall win five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.”*";
P_HTM[472]="***Now Venerable Nanda, although his fellow-monks despised him, were ashamed of him, and tormented him by calling him “hireling” and “bought with a price,” nevertheless, living in solitude, withdrawn from the world, heedful, ardent, resolute, in no long time, even in this life, himself abode in the knowledge, realization, and attainment of that supreme goal of the religious life for the sake of which goodly youths retire once and for all from the house-life to the houseless life. This did he know: “Birth is at an end, lived is the holy life, duty is done: I am no more for this world.” And there was yet another Venerable Elder numbered among the Arahats.*";
P_HTM[473]="***Now a certain deity came by night to the Teacher, illuminating the whole Jetavana; and bowing to the Teacher, thus addressed him, “Reverend Sir, Venerable Nanda, son of the sister of the mother of the Exalted One, by extinction of the Depravities, even in this life, himself abides in the knowledge, realization, and attainment of freedom from the Depravities, emancipation of the heart, emancipation of the intellect. And there arose within the Exalted One also knowledge of the following, “By extinction of the Depravities, Nanda, even in this life, himself abides in the knowledge, realization, and attainment of freedom from the Depravities, emancipation of the heart, emancipation of the intellect.”*";
P_HTM[474]="***In the course of the same night Venerable Nanda also approached the Exalted One, bowed to him, and spoke as follows, “Reverend Sir, I release the Exalted One from the promise which he made when he, the Exalted One, guaranteed that I should win five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.” The Exalted One replied, “Nanda, I myself grasped your mind with my own mind and saw, ‘By extinction of the Depravities, Nanda, even in this life, himself abides in the knowledge, realization, and attainment of freedom from the Depravities, emancipation of the heart, emancipation of the intellect.’ Likewise a deity informed me of the fact, saying, ‘By extinction of the Depravities, Nanda, even in this life, himself abides in the knowledge, realization, and attainment of freedom from the Depravities, emancipation of the heart, emancipation of the intellect.’ When, therefore, Nanda, you ceased to cling to the things of the world, and your heart was released from the Depravities, at that moment I was released from that promise.” Then the Exalted One, knowing the true inwardness of this matter, breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance,*";
P_HTM[475]="***He that has crossed over the mud and crushed the thorn of lust,*";
P_HTM[476]="***He that has destroyed delusion, such a man is unmoved, whether in pleasure or in pain.*";
P_HTM[477]="***Now one day the monks approached Venerable Nanda and asked him, “Brother Nanda, aforetime you said, ‘I am dissatisfied.’ Do you say the same thing now?” “Brethren, I am in no wise inclined to the life of a layman.” When the monks heard his answer, they said, “Venerable Nanda says that which is not true, utters falsehood. On former days he used to say, ‘I am dissatisfied,’ but now says, ‘I am in no wise inclined to the life of a layman.” And forthwith they went and reported the matter to the Exalted One. The Exalted One replied, “Monks, in former days Nanda’s personality was like an ill-thatched house, but now it has come to be like a well-thatched house. From the day he saw the celestial nymphs, he has striven to reach the goal of a monk’s labors, and now he has reached it.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[478]="***13. Even as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house,*";
P_HTM[479]="***So lust breaks through an ill-trained mind.*";
P_HTM[480]="***14. Even as rain breaks not through a well-thatched house,*";
P_HTM[481]="***So lust breaks not through a well-trained mind.*";
P_HTM[482]="***The monks began to discuss the incident in the Hall of Truth: “Brethren, the Buddhas are marvelous! Venerable Nanda became dissatisfied with the Religious Life all because of Janapada-Kaḷyānī; but the Teacher, employing celestial nymphs as a lure, won him to complete obedience.” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is not the first time Nanda has been won to obedience by the lure of the opposite sex; the same thing happened in a previous existence also.” So saying, he related the following*";
P_HTM[483]="***9 c. Story of the Past: Kappaṭa and the donkey*";
P_HTM[484]="***Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benāres, there dwelt at Benāres a merchant named Kappaṭa. Now Kappaṭa had a donkey which used to carry loads of pottery for him, and every day he used to go a journey of seven leagues. On a certain occasion Kappaṭa loaded his donkey down with a load of pottery and took him to Takkasilā. While he was engaged in disposing of his wares, he allowed the donkey to run loose. As the donkey wandered along the bank of a ditch, he saw a female of his species and straightway went up to her. She gave him a friendly greeting and said to him, “Where have you come from?” “From Benāres.” “On what errand?” “On business.” “How big a load do you carry?” “A big load of pottery.” “How many leagues do you travel, carrying a big load like that?” “Seven leagues.” “In the various places you visit, is there anyone to rub your feet and your back?” “No.” “If that’s the case, you must have a mighty hard time.”*";
P_HTM[485]="***(Of course animals have no one to rub their feet and their back; she said this merely to join bonds of love between them.)*";
P_HTM[486]="***As the result of her talk, the donkey became dissatisfied. After the merchant had disposed of his wares, he returned to the donkey and said to him, “Come, Jack, let’s be off.” “Go yourself; I won’t go.” Over and over again the merchant tried with gentle words to persuade him to go; and when, in spite of his efforts, the donkey remained balky, he vented abuse upon him. Finally he thought to himself, “I know a way to make him go,” and pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[487]="***I will make a goad for you, with a sixteen-inch thorn;*";
P_HTM[488]="***I will cut your body to shreds; know this, donkey.*";
P_HTM[489]="***When the donkey heard that, he said, “In that case I shall know just what to do to you.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[490]="***You say you will make a goad for me, with a sixteen-inch thorn. Very well!*";
P_HTM[491]="***In that case I will plant my fore feet, let fly with my hind feet,*";
P_HTM[492]="***And knock out your teeth; know that, Kappaṭa.*";
P_HTM[493]="***When the merchant heard that, he thought to himself, “What can be the reason for his talking thus?” The merchant looked this way and that, and finally his eyes fell upon the female. “Ah!” thought the merchant to himself, “she must have taught him these tricks. I will say to the donkey, ‘I will bring you home a mate like that.’ Thus, by employing the lure of the opposite sex, I will make him go.” Accordingly he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[494]="***A four-footed female, with face like mother-of-pearl, possessed of all the marks of beauty,*";
P_HTM[495]="***Will I bring to you to be your mate; know that, donkey.*";
P_HTM[496]="***When the donkey heard that, his heart rejoiced, and he replied with the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[497]="***So “a four-footed female, with face like mother-of-pearl, possessed of all the marks of beauty,”*";
P_HTM[498]="***You will bring to me to be my mate; in that case, Kappaṭa,*";
P_HTM[499]="***Whereas hitherto I have traveled seven leagues a day, hereafter, I will travel fourteen leagues.*";
P_HTM[500]="***“Well then,” said Kappaṭa, “come!” And taking the donkey with him, he went back to the place where he had left the cart.*";
P_HTM[501]="***After a few days the donkey said to him, “Didn’t you say to me, ‘I will bring you a mate’?” The merchant replied, “Yes, I said just that, and I will not break my word; I will bring you home a mate. But I will provide food only for you. It may or may not be enough for both you and your mate, but that is a matter for you alone to decide. After you both have lived together, foals will be born to you. The food I shall give you may or may not be enough for both you and your mate and your foals too, but that is a matter for you alone to decide.” As the merchant spoke these words, the donkey lost his desire.*";
P_HTM[502]="***When the Teacher had ended his lesson, he concluded the Jātaka as follows, “At that time, monks, the female donkey was Janapada-Kaḷyānī, the male donkey was Nanda, and the merchant was I myself. In former times, too, Nanda was won to obedience by the lure of the female sex.”*";
P_HTM[503]="*[10] 10. Cundasūkarikavatthu**10. Cunda the Pork-Butcher*";
P_HTM[504]="***15. Here he suffers; after death he suffers: the evildoer suffers in both places.*";
P_HTM[505]="***He suffers, he is afflicted, seeing the impurity of his own past deeds.*";
P_HTM[506]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Cunda the pork-butcher.*";
P_HTM[507]="***The story goes that for fifty-five years Cunda made his living by killing pigs which he then either used for food or marketed. In time of famine he would go to the country with his cart filled with rice, and return with it filled with shotes bought in villages for a mere pint-pot or two of rice apiece. Back of his house he had a plot of ground fenced off as a sort of pigsty, and there he kept his pigs, feeding them all kinds of shrubs and excrement.*";
P_HTM[508]="***Whenever he wanted to kill a pig, he would fasten the pig securely to a post and pound him with a square club to make his flesh swell plump and tender. Then, forcing open the pig’s jaws and inserting a little wedge in his mouth, he would pour down his throat boiling hot water from a copper boiler. The hot water would penetrate the pig’s belly, loosening the excrement, and would pass out through the anus, carrying boiling hot excrement with it. So long as there was even a little excrement left in the pig’s belly, the water would come out stained and turbid; but as soon as the pig’s belly was clean, the water would come out pure and clear.*";
P_HTM[509]="***The rest of the water he would pour over the pig’s back, and the water would peel off the black skin as it ran off. Then he would singe off the bristles with a torch. Finally, he would cut off the pig’s head with a sharp sword. As the blood gushed forth, he would catch it in a dish; then he would roast the pig, basting it with the blood he had caught. Then he would sit down with his son and his wife and eat the pig. Whatever meat was left over, he would sell. In this way he made a living for fifty-five years. Although the Teacher was in residence at a neighboring monastery, not on a single day did Cunda do him honor by offering him so much as a handful of flowers or a spoonful of rice, nor did he do a single work of merit besides.*";
P_HTM[510]="***One day he was attacked by a malady, and while he yet remained alive, the fire of the Great Hell of Avīci uprose before him. (The fire of Avīci is a consuming torment able to destroy the eyes of one who stands a hundred leagues away and looks at it. Indeed, it has been described in this wise, “For ever and ever it shoots forth its flames continually a hundred leagues in all directions.” Moreover, the Elder Nāgasena employed the following simile to show how much more intense is its heat than that of ordinary fire, “Great king, reflect that a rock even as big as a pagoda goes to destruction in the fire of Hell in but an instant. However, living beings who are reborn there, through the effect of their past deeds, suffer not destruction, but are as though they reposed in their mothers’ wombs.”)*";
P_HTM[511]="***When the torment of the Great Hell of Avīci uprose before the pork-butcher Cunda, his mode of behavior was altered in correspondence with his past deeds. Even as he remained within his house, he began to grunt like a pig and to crawl about on his hands and knees, first to the front of the house and then to the rear. The men of his household overpowered him and gagged him. But in spite of all they did (since it is impossible for anyone to prevent a man’s past deeds from bearing fruit), he kept crawling back and forth, grunting like a pig continually.*";
P_HTM[512]="***Not a person was able to sleep in the seven houses round about. The members of his own household, terrified by the fear of death, unable otherwise to prevent him from going out, barricaded the doors of the house that he might not be able to go out, but might be confined within. Having so done, they surrounded the house and stood on guard. Back and forth for seven days crawled Cunda within his house, suffering the torment of Hell, grunting and squealing like a pig. Having thus crawled about for a period of seven days, he died on the seventh day and was reborn in the Great Hell of Avīci. (The Great Hell of Avīci is to be described in the terms of the Devaduta Suttanta.)*";
P_HTM[513]="***Some monks who passed the door of his house heard the noise, and thinking it was merely the noise of the grunting and squealing of pigs, went on to the monastery, seated themselves in the presence of the Teacher, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, for seven days the door of Cunda the pork-butcher’s house has been closed, and for seven days the killing of pigs has gone on; doubtless he intends to give some entertainment. Think, Reverend Sir, how many pigs he has killed! Evidently he has not a single thought of loving-kindness and lacks utterly the sentiment of compassion. So cruel and savage a being has never been known before.”*";
P_HTM[514]="***Said the Teacher, “Monks, he has not been killing pigs these seven days. Retribution in harmony with his past deeds has overtaken him. Even while he yet remained alive, the torment of the Great Hell of Avīci uprose before him. By reason of this torment he crawled hither and thither in his house for seven days, grunting and squealing like a pig. To-day he died, and was reborn in the Avīci hell.” When the Teacher had thus spoken, the monks said, “Reverend Sir, having suffered thus here in this world, he went again to a place of suffering and was there reborn.” “Yes, monks,” replied the Teacher. “He that is heedless, be he layman or monk, suffers in both places equally.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[515]="***15. Here he suffers; after death he suffers: the evildoer suffers in both places.*";
P_HTM[516]="***He suffers, he is afflicted, seeing the impurity of his own past deeds.*";
P_HTM[517]="*[11] 11. Dhammikaupāsakavatthu**11. The Righteous Lay Brother*";
P_HTM[518]="***16. Here he rejoices; after death he rejoices: he that has done good works rejoices in both places.*";
P_HTM[519]="***He rejoices, he rejoices exceedingly, seeing the purity of his own past deeds.*";
P_HTM[520]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a righteous lay brother.*";
P_HTM[521]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, lived five hundred righteous lay brethren, each with a retinue of five hundred lay brethren. The senior layman had seven sons and seven daughters. Each of these sons gave regularly ticket-porridge, ticket-food, food of the waning moon, food of the new moon, invitation-food, fast-day food, visitors’ food, and food of the season of the rains. All of them were “later born,” so that the layman and his wife and fourteen children maintained sixteen forms of alms. And the layman, virtuous, upright, together with son and wife, took delight in the distribution of alms.*";
P_HTM[522]="***After a time the layman was attacked by a disease, and his vital forces began to decay. Desiring to hear the Law, he sent word to the Teacher, “Send me eight or sixteen monks.” The Teacher sent them, and they straightway went and gathered around his bed and sat down on seats prepared for them. “Reverend Sirs,” said the layman, “it will be difficult for me to see you, for I am weak; rehearse me but a single Sutta.” “Which Sutta would you like to hear, lay brother?” “The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, common to all the Buddhas.” Accordingly they began to rehearse the Sutta, beginning with the words, “There is this one Way, monks, this one Path which leads to the Salvation of living beings.”*";
P_HTM[523]="***At that moment, from the Six Worlds of the Gods, approached six chariots a hundred and fifty leagues long, drawn by a thousand Sindh horses, adorned with all the adornments. In each chariot stood a deity, and each deity spoke and said, “Permit us to convey you to our celestial world.” And they spoke again and said, “Even as one shatters a clay vessel and replaces it with a vessel of gold, even so are living beings reborn to take their pleasure in our celestial world.” The lay disciple, unwilling to be interrupted in listening to the Law, said, “Wait! wait!” The monks, thinking that he was speaking to them, ceased their recitation of the Law. His sons and daughters cried out, “Formerly our father could never hear enough of the Law. But now, after summoning the monks and directing them to rehearse the Law, he stops them himself. After all, there is no man who does not fear death.” The monks said to each other, “This is no time for us to remain.” And forthwith they arose and departed.*";
P_HTM[524]="***After a time the layman recovered his attention and asked his sons, “Why do you weep?” “Dear father,” said they, “you sent for the monks, and even as you listened to the Law, you yourself stopped them from rehearsing the Law. We weep to think, ‘After all, there is no man who does not fear death.’ ” “But where are the noble monks?” “They said to each other, ‘This is no time for us to remain.’ And forthwith they arose from their seats and departed.” “Dear sons, I was not speaking to the noble monks.” “With whom, then, were you talking, dear father?” “From the Six Worlds of the Gods six deities approached in six magnificently adorned chariots, and standing in their chariots poised in the air, they said to me, ‘Take your pleasure in our celestial world; take your pleasure in our celestial world.’ I was talking with them.” “Dear father, where are the chariots? We do not see them.” “Have I any wreaths of flowers?” “Yes, dear father.” “Which celestial world is the most delightful?” “Dear father, the most delightful is the World of the Tusita gods, the abode of the mothers and fathers of the Buddhas and of all the Future Buddhas.” “Well then, throw a wreath of flowers and say, ‘Let this wreath of flowers cling to the chariot which came from the World of the Tusita gods.’ ”*";
P_HTM[525]="***Accordingly the children of the layman threw the wreath of flowers, and it clung to the pole of the chariot and hung suspended in the air. The populace saw the wreath of flowers suspended in the air, but did not see the chariot. Said the lay disciple, “Do you see this wreath of flowers?” “Yes, we see it.” “This wreath hangs suspended from the chariot which came from the World of the Tusita gods. I am going to the World of the Tusita gods; be not disturbed. If you desire to be reborn with me, do works of merit even as I have done.” And when he had thus spoken, he died and set foot in the chariot. Immediately he was reborn as a deity three-quarters of a league in stature, adorned with sixty cartloads of ornaments. A retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs attended him, and a golden mansion twenty-five leagues in extent became visible.*";
P_HTM[526]="***When those monks reached the monastery, the Teacher asked them, “Monks, did the lay disciple hearken to the recitation of the Law?” “Yes, Reverend Sir. But in the midst of the recitation he cried out, ‘Wait! wait!’ and stopped us. Then his sons and daughters began to weep, whereupon we said to each other, ‘This is no time for us to remain,’ and arose from our seats and departed.” “Monks, he was not talking to you. From the Six Worlds of the Gods six deities approached in six magnificently adorned chariots, and they summoned that lay disciple to go with them; but the lay disciple, unwilling that the recitation of the Law should be interrupted, spoke to them.” “Is that true, Reverend Sir?” “That is true, monks.” “Reverend Sir, where was he reborn just now?” “In the World of the Tusita gods, monks.”*";
P_HTM[527]="***“Reverend Sir, but recently he lived here among his kinsfolk rejoicing, and just now he went again to a place of rejoicing and was there reborn.” “Yes, monks. They that are heedful, be they laymen or monks, rejoice in both places equally.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[528]="***16. Here he rejoices; after death he rejoices: he that has done good works rejoices in both places.*";
P_HTM[529]="***He rejoices, he rejoices exceedingly, seeing the purity of his own past deeds.*";
P_HTM[530]="*[12] 12. Devadattavatthu**12. Devadatta’s Career*";
P_HTM[531]="***17. Here he suffers, after death he suffers; the evildoer suffers in both places.*";
P_HTM[532]="***He suffers to think, “I have done evil;” yet more does he suffer, gone to a place of suffering.*";
P_HTM[533]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while in residence at Jetavana with reference to Devadatta. The story of Devadatta, from the time he became a monk to the time the earth opened and swallowed him up, is related in all the Jātakas. The following is a synopsis of the story:*";
P_HTM[534]="***12 a. Retirement from the world of the six princes*";
P_HTM[535]="***While the Teacher was in residence at Anupiya Mango-grove, which lies near Anupiya, a market-town of the Mallas, eighty thousand kinsmen one day recognized on him the Characteristics of a Tathāgata, and eighty thousand youths asserted, “Let him be a king or a Buddha, he will spend his days surrounded by a retinue of Warrior-princes.” After all but six of these youths had retired from the world and become monks, the company of princes, observing that the six Sakyan princes, King Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, and Devadatta, had not yet retired from the world, discussed the matter as follows, “We admit only our own sons to the Order. But of course these six Sakyan princes are not kinsmen of the Buddha. For this reason, doubtless, they have not retired from the world and become monks.” Now one day the Sakyan prince Mahānāma approached Anuruddha and said, “Friend, there isn’t one of our family who has become a monk. You become a monk and I will follow your example.”*";
P_HTM[536]="***Now Anuruddha is said to have been brought up in such softness and luxury that he had never heard the word isn’t before. For example, one day these six Sakyan princes engaged in a game of marbles. Anuruddha staked cakes on the result, proved a loser, and sent home for cakes. His mother prepared cakes and sent them. The princes ate the cakes and resumed their play. Anuruddha lost repeatedly. Three times in all his mother sent him cakes. The fourth time she sent back word, “There isn’t cake to send. Now Anuruddha had never before heard the word isn’t. Therefore, supposing that this must be a variety of cake, he sent the man back, saying to him, “Fetch me some isn’t cakes.” When his mother received the message, “Then, my lady, send me some isn’t cakes,” she thought to herself, “My son has never heard the word isn’t before. By this means, however, I can teach him the meaning of it.” So she took an empty golden bowl, covered it with another golden bowl, and sent it to her son.*";
P_HTM[537]="***The guardian deities of the city thought, “When Anuruddha the Sakyan was Annabhāra, he gave food that was his own portion to the Private Buddha Upariṭṭha, making the Earnest Wish, ‘May I never hear the word isn’t; may I never know where food comes from.’ Now if he sees the empty bowl, we shall never be able to enter the assembly of the gods; it may even happen that our heads will split into seven pieces.” So they filled the bowl with celestial cakes. As soon as the bowl was set down on the round platter uncovered, the fragrance of the cakes permeated the entire city. Moreover, the moment a morsel of cake was placed in the mouth, it thrilled the seven thousand nerves of taste. Anuruddha thought to himself, “My mother does not love me; all this time she has never fried this isn’t cake for me. From this time forth I shall eat no other kind of cake.” So he went home and asked his mother, “Mother, do you love me or do you not?” “My dear son, even as the eye is dear to one who possesses but one eye, and even as the heart, so are you exceedingly dear to me.” “Then, dear mother, why is it that all this time you have not fried isn’t cake for me?” Said the mother to her little page, “Boy, is there nothing in the bowl?” “My lady, the plate is filled to overflowing with cakes, and with such cakes as I have never seen before.” The mother thought to herself, “It must be that my son has acquired great merit; it must be that he has made an Earnest Wish; deities must have filled the plate with cakes and sent them.” Said the son to the mother, “Dear mother, from this time forth I will eat no other kind of cake than this; henceforth, I pray you, fry isn’t cake alone for me.” From that time forth, whenever her son said, “I should like some cakes to eat,” she would send a bowl absolutely empty, covered with another bowl. So long as he continued to live at home, during all that time deities sent him celestial cakes. Since Anuruddha was so unsophisticated as all this, how could he be expected to know the meaning of the expression becoming a monk?*";
P_HTM[538]="***For this reason, therefore, he asked his brother, “What is this becoming a monk?” His brother replied, “The life of a monk involves cutting off the hair and beard, sleeping with indifference whether in a thorn-brake or in a fine bed, and going the rounds for alms,” Anuruddha replied, “Brother, I am exceedingly delicate; I shall never be able to become a monk.” “Very well, my dear brother, then learn farming and live the life of a householder. But at least one of us must become a monk.” Then said Anuruddha, “What is this farming?”*";
P_HTM[539]="***How could you expect a youth to know the meaning of the word farming who did not know where food comes from? For example, on a certain day a discussion arose among the three princes Kimbila, Bhaddiya, and Anuruddha as to where food comes from. Kimbila said, “It comes from the barn.” Bhaddiya said to him, “You do not know where food comes from; it comes from the boiler,” Anuruddha said, “Both of you together do not know where food comes from. It comes from a golden bowl with jeweled knob.”*";
P_HTM[540]="***We are told that one day Kimbila saw rice being removed from a barn, and immediately formed the opinion, “These grains of rice were produced in the barn.” Likewise one day Bhaddiya saw food being taken out of a boiler, and formed the opinion, “It was produced in the boiler.” Anuruddha, however, had never seen men pounding rice or boiling it or taking it out of the boiler, but had seen it only after it had been taken out of the boiler and set before him. So Anuruddha formed the opinion, “When one desires to eat, food makes its appearance in a golden bowl.” Such was the ignorance of all three princes as to where food comes from.*";
P_HTM[541]="***Now when Anuruddha asked the question, “What is this farming?” he received the following answer, “First the field must be plowed, and after that such and such other things must be done, and these things must be done year after year.” Said he to himself, “When will the duties connected with farming ever come to an end? When shall we ever have time to enjoy our possessions in peace?” And because it seemed to him that the duties connected with farming would never come to an end and never cease, he said to his brother, “Well then, if this is the case, you may live the life of a householder. But as for me, I have no use for it.” Accordingly he approached his mother and said to her, “Mother, give me your permission; I wish to become a monk.”*";
P_HTM[542]="***Thrice Anuruddha requested his mother to give him permission to become a monk, and thrice she refused to do so. Finally she said to him, “If your friend King Bhaddiya will become a monk, then you may become a monk with him.” Accordingly he approached his friend Bhaddiya and said to him, “Friend, whether I shall become a monk or not is conditional upon your becoming a monk.” Anuruddha urged his friend Bhaddiya with every argument at his command to become a monk, and finally, on the seventh day, obtained Bhaddiya’s promise to become a monk with him.*";
P_HTM[543]="***So six princes of the Warrior caste, Bhaddiya, king of the Sakyans, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, and Devadatta, accompanied by Upāli the barber as seventh man, for seven days enjoyed celestial glory like gods, and then set out with fourfold array, as though on their way to a pleasure-garden. When they reached foreign territory, they turned back their army by royal command, and then entered foreign territory. There each of the six princes removed his own ornaments, made a bundle of them, and gave them to Upāli, saying, “Now, Upāli, turn back. All this wealth will suffice to provide you with means of livelihood.” Upāli flung himself at their feet, rolled over and over on the ground, and wept bitterly. But not daring to disobey the order, he arose and turned back. When they parted, the forest wept, as it were, and the earth quaked, as it were.*";
P_HTM[544]="***When Upāli had gone a little way, he thought to himself, “Harsh and cruel are these Sakyans; they may kill me, thinking I have killed their brethren. These Sakyan princes have renounced all this splendor, have cast away these priceless ornaments like a mass of saliva, and intend to become monks; why not I?” So saying, he untied the bundle, hung those ornaments on a tree, and said, “Let those who want them take them.” Having so done, he went to the Sakyan princes, and when they asked him why he had turned back, told them the whole story.*";
P_HTM[545]="***So the six Sakyan princes took Upāli the barber with them, went to the Teacher, and said to him, “We, Reverend Sir, are proud Sakyans. This man has been a servitor of ours for a long time. Admit him to the Order first; to him first we will offer respectful salutations; so will our pride be humbled.” Thus first did they cause Upāli the barber to be admitted to the Order, and after that entered the Order themselves.*";
P_HTM[546]="***Of the six Sakyan princes. Venerable Bhaddiya attained Threefold Knowledge in that very rainy season. Venerable Anuruddha attained Supernatural Vision, and after listening to the Sutta entitled “The Reflections of a Great Man,” attained Arahatship. Venerable Ānanda was established in the Fruit of Conversion. Elder Bhagu and Elder Kimbila subsequently developed Spiritual Insight and attained Arahatship. Devadatta attained the lower grade of Magic Power.*";
P_HTM[547]="***After a time, while the Teacher was in residence at Kosambi, rich gain and honor accrued to the Tathāgata and his company of disciples. Men entered the monastery bearing in their hands robes, medicines, and other offerings and asked, “Where is the Teacher? Where is the Elder Sāriputta? Where is the Elder Moggallāna? Where is the Elder Kassapa? Where is the Elder Bhaddiya? Where is the Elder Anuruddha? Where is the Elder Ānanda? Where is the Elder Bhagu? Where is the Elder Kimbila?” So saying, they went about looking at the places where sat the eighty Chief Disciples.*";
P_HTM[548]="***12 b. Devadatta’s wicked deeds*";
P_HTM[549]="***Since no one asked, “Where does the Elder Devadatta sit and stand?” Devadatta thought to himself, “I became a monk at the same time as these other monks. Even as they are men of the Warrior caste who have become monks, so also am I a man of the Warrior caste who have become a monk. But whereas men bearing rich offerings seek out these monks, no one takes my name on his lips. With whom now can I make common cause? With whom can I ingratiate myself, that I may obtain gain and honor for myself?”*";
P_HTM[550]="***Then the following thought occurred to him, “This King Bimbisāra, on the day when he first saw the Buddha, became established in the Fruit of Conversion, together with eleven nahutas of men besides; I cannot make common cause with him. Neither can I make common cause with the king of Kosala. But this king’s son Ajātasattu knows no one’s good qualities or bad qualities; I will make common cause with him.” Accordingly Devadatta departed from Kosambi to Rājagaha, transformed himself into a youth, put four snakes on his hands and feet, put one snake about his neck, coiled one snake about his head as a cushion-rest, placed one snake on one shoulder, and thus arrayed in a girdle of snakes, he descended from the air and seated himself in Ajātasattu’s lap. Ajātasattu was frightened and said, “Who are you?” “I am Devadatta.” In order to dispel Ajātasattu’s fear, Devadatta changed his form, stood before Ajātasattu wearing the robe of a monk and carrying a monk’s bowl, ingratiated himself with Ajātasattu, and obtained for himself gain and honor.*";
P_HTM[551]="***Overcome with the gain and honor he received, Devadatta thought to himself, “It is I who ought to be at the head of the Congregation of Monks.” Once having allowed this evil thought to spring up in his breast, with the springing up of the evil thought Devadatta lost the power to work miracles. Now at this time the Teacher was preaching the Law to the Congregation at Veḷuvana monastery, and the king was among the Congregation. While the Exalted One was preaching the Law, Devadatta paid obeisance to him, and then rising from his seat, extended his hands in an attitude of reverent salutation and said, “Reverend Sir, the Exalted One is now worn out, stricken with years, and aged; let him live a pleasant life in this world, free from care. I will direct the Congregation of Monks; commit the Congregation of Monks to my hands.” The Teacher, instead of consenting to the arrangement suggested by Devadatta, refused his request and called him a lick-spittle. Therefore Devadatta was highly indignant, and now for the first time conceiving hatred towards the Teacher, departed. The Teacher caused public proclamation to be made concerning Devadatta at Rājagaha.*";
P_HTM[552]="***Devadatta thought to himself, “Now I have been rejected by the monk Gotama; now I will make trouble for him.” With this thought in mind he approached Ajātasattu and said to him, “Youth, aforetime men were long-lived, but now they are short-lived. This makes it probable that you, being a prince, will soon die. Well then! You kill your father and become king, and I will kill the Exalted One and become Buddha.” So when Ajātasattu was established in his kingdom, Devadatta hired men to kill the Tathāgata. But the men he hired attained the Fruit of Conversion and turned back. Then Devadatta himself climbed Vulture Peak and said to himself, “I alone will deprive the monk Gotama of life.” So saying, he split off a piece of rock and hurled it down. But he succeeded only in drawing the Teacher’s blood. Failing in this way also to kill him, he next dispatched the elephant Nālāgiri against the Teacher. When the elephant approached, the Elder Ānanda offered his own life in behalf of the Teacher and stood in the breach. The Teacher subdued the elephant, and then departed from the city and went to the monastery. After partaking of the offerings of food brought by countless thousands of lay disciples, he preached in due course to the residents of Rājagaha, one hundred and eighty millions in number, and eighty-four thousand living beings obtained Comprehension of the Law. Said the monks, “How noble is the Venerable Ānanda! When so mighty an elephant approached, he offered his own life and stood in front of the Teacher.” The Teacher, hearing the Elder praised in this wise, said, “Monks, this is not the first time he has renounced his life for my sake; he did the same thing in a previous state of existence,” And in response to a request of the monks he related the Culla Haṁsa, Mahā Haṁsa, and Kakkaṭa Jātakas.*";
P_HTM[553]="***Devadatta’s wickedness did not by any means become so notorious from his having compassed the king’s death nor from his hiring murderers to kill the Tathāgata nor from his splitting off the piece of rock, as it did from his letting loose the elephant Nālāgiri. For upon that, the people raised a tumult and said, “Devadatta alone had the king killed and hired murderers and cast down the rock. But now he has turned the elephant Nālāgiri loose. Behold what manner of evildoer the king has on his hands!” The king then, hearing the words of the populace, caused Devadatta’s five hundred cooking-vessels to be removed and did not thereafter minister to his wants. Likewise the citizens did not so much as offer food to him when he came to their houses.*";
P_HTM[554]="***When he had thus lost gain and honor, he determined to live by deceit. Therefore he approached the Teacher and made the Five Demands. But the Teacher rejected his demands, saying, “Enough, Devadatta! Whoever so desires, let him be a forest hermit.” “Brethren, whose words are the nobler, the words of the Tathāgata or the words which I myself have uttered? Very well, Reverend Sir, all their life long monks should be forest-dwellers, beggars, wearers of rags from a dust-heap, living at the foot of a tree, eating neither fish nor flesh. Whosoever desires release from suffering, let him come with me.” So saying, Devadatta departed.*";
P_HTM[555]="***Some monks who had but recently retired from the world and who possessed little intelligence, hearing his words, said, “Devadatta spoke fair; let us join him.” So they joined him. Thus Devadatta with his five hundred monks sought to persuade all manner of people, both hardened and believing, to accept the Five Points. And living by soliciting food from various families, he strove to create a schism in the Order. The Exalted One asked him, “Devadatta, is it true, as men say, that you are striving to create schism and heresy in the Order?” “It is true,” replied Devadatta. Said the Teacher, “Devadatta, it is a grievous thing to create a schism in the Order.” Continuing, the Teacher admonished him at length. But Devadatta paid no attention to the Teacher’s words. He went forth, and seeing the Venerable Elder Ānanda going his round for alms in Rājagaha, said to him, “Brother Ānanda, from this day forth I shall keep Fast and Chapter apart from the Exalted One, apart from the Order.” The Elder told the Exalted One. When the Teacher realized the fact, he was filled with righteous indignation and said to himself, “Devadatta is doing that which will be of no profit to him in the Worlds of the Gods and the world of men; that which will cause him to be tormented in the Avīci hell.” And he reflected,*";
P_HTM[556]="***Easy to do are deeds that are evil, deeds that bring harm.*";
P_HTM[557]="***But the deed that brings welfare, the deed that is good, that truly is hard to do.*";
P_HTM[558]="***Having pronounced this Stanza, he then breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance,*";
P_HTM[559]="***Easy to do for the good is the good; the good for the evil man is hard.*";
P_HTM[560]="***Evil for the evil man is easy to do; evil for the noble is hard.*";
P_HTM[561]="***On Fast-day, as Devadatta sat on one side with his own retinue, he said, “Let whoever approves of these Five Points take a ticket.”*";
P_HTM[562]="***Five hundred Licchavi princes, novices having little gratitude, took tickets. Devadatta took these monks with him and went to Gayāsīsa. When the Teacher heard that he had gone there, he sent forth the two Chief Disciples to bring those monks back. The Chief Disciples went there, instructed the monks by performing miracles and wonders, caused them to drink the Deathless, and returned through the air, bringing them with them.*";
P_HTM[563]="***Said Kokālika, “Rise, brother Devadatta; Sāriputta and Moggallāna have carried off your monks. Do you not remember my saying to you, ‘Brother, trust not Sāriputta and Moggallāna’?” Said Devadatta, “Sāriputta and Moggallāna cherish evil desires, are under the control of evil desires.” As he spoke thus, he struck the center of his heart with his knee, and straightway hot blood burst forth from his mouth.*";
P_HTM[564]="***When the monks saw Venerable Sāriputta, surrounded by his retinue of monks, soaring through the air, they said, “Reverend Sir, when Venerable Sāriputta went hence, he went with but a single companion; but now he is returning resplendent with a great retinue.” Said the Teacher, “Monks, it is not the first time this has happened; when my son was reborn in the form of an animal, then also did he return to me resplendent.” So saying, he recited the Lakkhaṇa Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[565]="***All goes well with the virtuous, with those whose disposition is friendly.*";
P_HTM[566]="***Behold Lakkhaṇa returning at the head of a host of relatives;*";
P_HTM[567]="***Then look upon yonder Kāla without relatives.*";
P_HTM[568]="***Again said the monks, “Reverend Sir, they say that Devadatta seats a Chief Disciple on either side of him and imitates you, saying, ‘I will preach the Law with the grace of a Buddha.’ ” Said the Teacher, “Monks, this is not the first time he has so done; in a previous state of existence also he strove to imitate me, but was not able to do so.*";
P_HTM[569]="***Vīraka, have you seen a sweet-voiced bird*";
P_HTM[570]="***With neck like that of a peacock, my husband Saviṭṭhaka?*";
P_HTM[571]="***Because he tried to imitate a bird that walks both on water and on land,*";
P_HTM[572]="***Saviṭṭhaka became entangled in a sevāla-plant and died.*";
P_HTM[573]="***Supplying the rest of the story, the Teacher related the Vīraka Jātaka. On succeeding days, with reference to the same subject, the Teacher related the Kandagalaka and Virocana Jātakas:*";
P_HTM[574]="***This garuḍa bird went through the woods pecking at trees whose branches were soft and rotten.*";
P_HTM[575]="***At last he came to an acacia-tree, whose wood is always sound, and broke his head.*";
P_HTM[576]="***Your brains have run out, your head is split open,*";
P_HTM[577]="***All your ribs are broken; to-day you are a pretty sight!*";
P_HTM[578]="***Again one day, hearing the remark, “Devadatta was ungrateful,” the Teacher related the Java Sakuṇa Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[579]="***We did you what service we could.*";
P_HTM[580]="***King of beasts, we render homage to you.*";
P_HTM[581]="***May we obtain some favor from you.*";
P_HTM[582]="***Seeing that I hold you fast between my jaws, I who feed upon blood,*";
P_HTM[583]="***I whose nature is to kill, it is a great deal that you yet live.*";
P_HTM[584]="***Again with reference to Devadatta’s going about for the purpose of slaying, he related the Kuruṅga Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[585]="***It is well known to the antelope, that you let drop the fruit of the sepaṇṇi.*";
P_HTM[586]="***Let us go to another sepaṇṇi; your tree likes me not.*";
P_HTM[587]="***Again when the discussion took this turn, “Devadatta fell away both from gain and honor and from the high position of a monk,” the Teacher said, “Monks, this is not the first time he has so fallen away; in a previous state of existence also he fell away.” So saying, he related the Ubhatobhaṭṭha Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[588]="***Your eyes are put out, your garments are lost, in your own house there is strife;*";
P_HTM[589]="***Your business is ruined in both places, both on water and on land.*";
P_HTM[590]="***In this wise did the Teacher, while he was in residence at Rājagaha, relate many Jātakas about Devadatta. From Rājagaha he went to Sāvatthi, and took up his residence at Jetavana monastery.*";
P_HTM[591]="***Devadatta’s sickness continued for nine months; at the last, desiring to see the Teacher, he said to his own disciples, “I desire to see the Teacher; make it possible for me to see him.” They replied, “When you enjoyed good health, you walked at enmity with the Teacher; we will not lead you to him.” Said Devadatta, “Do not destroy me; I have indeed conceived hatred towards the Teacher, but the Teacher has not cherished so much as the tip of a hair’s hatred towards me.” And in very truth,*";
P_HTM[592]="***Towards the murderer Devadatta, towards the robber Aṅgulimāla,*";
P_HTM[593]="***Towards Dhanapāla and Rāhula, to each and all he manifested an even temper.*";
P_HTM[594]="***“Let me see the Exalted One,” begged Devadatta again and again; so finally they laid him on a litter and started out with him. When the monks heard that Devadatta was approaching, they informed the Teacher of the fact, saying, “Reverend Sir, we hear that Devadatta is coming to see you.” “Monks, he will not succeed in seeing me in this present existence.” (It is said that from the moment monks make the Five Demands, they invariably fail to see the Buddhas again.) “Reverend Sir, he has reached such and such a place; he has reached such and such a place.” “Let him do as he likes; he will never succeed in seeing me again.” “Reverend Sir, now he is only a league distant, now he is only half a league distant, now he is only a gavuta distant, now he has reached the lotus-tank.” “Even if he enters within the Jetavana, he will not succeed in seeing me.”*";
P_HTM[595]="***Those who came with Devadatta set the litter down on the bank of the lotus-tank at the Jetavana and descended into the tank to bathe. Devadatta arose from his litter and sat down, resting both feet on the ground, whereupon his feet sank into the earth. By degrees he sank into the earth, first to the ankles, then to the knees, then to the hips, then to the breast, then to the neck. Finally, when his jaw-bone rested on the ground, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[596]="***With these bones, with these vital airs, I seek refuge in the Buddha,*";
P_HTM[597]="***Preeminent among men, god of gods, charioteer of untamed humanity,*";
P_HTM[598]="***All-seeing, endowed with the auspicious marks of a hundred virtues.*";
P_HTM[599]="***There is a tradition that when the Tathāgata saw that matters had gone thus far, he made a monk of Devadatta. And this he did because he became aware of the following, “If he shall remain a layman and not be received into the Order as a monk, inasmuch as he has been guilty of grievous crimes, it will be impossible for him to look forwards with confidence to future existence; but if he shall become a monk, no matter how grievous the crimes he has committed, it will be possible for him to look forwards with confidence to future existence.” (At the end of a hundred thousand cycles of time he will become a Private Buddha named Aṭṭhissara.)*";
P_HTM[600]="***When Devadatta had sunk into the earth, he was reborn in the Avīci hell. “Since he sinned against an unchanging Buddha, let him endure torture unchanging;” and such was the torture he suffered. When he had entered the Avīci hell, which is a hundred leagues in extent, his body became a hundred leagues in height. His head, as far as the outer ear, entered an iron skull; his feet, as far as the ankles, entered earth of iron. An iron stake as thick as the trunk of a palmyra-tree proceeded forth from the west wall of the iron shell, pierced the small of his back, came forth from his breast, and penetrated the east wall. Another iron stake proceeded forth from the south wall, pierced his right side, came forth from his left side, and penetrated the north wall. Another iron stake proceeded forth from the top of the iron skull, pierced his skull, came forth from his lower parts, and penetrated earth of iron. In this position, immovable, he suffers this mode of torture.*";
P_HTM[601]="***The monks began a discussion, saying, “All this distance came Devadatta, but failed to see the Teacher, and was swallowed up by the earth.” Said the Teacher, “Monks, this was not the first time Devadatta sinned against me and was swallowed up by the earth; in a previous state of existence also he was swallowed up by the earth,” And by way of illustrating the point, he told the story of an incident in his own previous existence as king of the elephants. He directed aright a man who had lost his way, allowed him to mount his own back, and carried him to a place of safety, only to have the man return to him three successive times and saw off first the tips of his tusks, then the middle, and then the roots. As the man passed out of sight of the Great Creature, he was swallowed up by the earth.*";
P_HTM[602]="***The Teacher then completed the Sīlava Nāga Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[603]="***If one should give the whole earth to an ungrateful man,*";
P_HTM[604]="***A man who is ever looking for an opportunity, it would not satisfy him.*";
P_HTM[605]="***The discussion reverting to the same subject again and again, in order to illustrate the swallowing up of Devadatta by the earth in his existence as Kalāburājā for an offense against himself in his existence as Khantivādi, he related the Khantivādi Jātaka. Again, in order to illustrate the swallowing up of Devadatta by the earth in his existence as Mahāpatāparājā for an offense against himself in his existence as Culla Dhammapāla, he related the Culla Dhammapāla Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[606]="***Now when Devadatta was swallowed up by the earth, the populace was pleased and delighted, and raising flags and banners and plantain-trees and setting up brimming jars, held high festival, saying, “His death is indeed our great gain.” When the monks reported this incident to the Exalted One, the Exalted One said, “Monks, this is not the first time the populace has rejoiced at Devadatta’s death; in times past also the populace rejoiced thereat.” And when he had thus spoken, to illustrate the rejoicing of the populace at the death of King Piṅgala of Benāres, a man who was hated by all the people for his harshness and cruelty, he related the Piṅgala Jātaka:*";
P_HTM[607]="***All the people suffered harm at the hands of Piṅgala; so soon as he was dead they recovered confidence.*";
P_HTM[608]="***Was he of the yellow eyes dear to you? Why do you weep, porter?*";
P_HTM[609]="***He of the yellow eyes was not dear to me; I fear to think of his return.*";
P_HTM[610]="***Now that he has gone hence, he may harm the king of death, and the king of death thus harmed may send him back again.*";
P_HTM[611]="***Finally the monks asked the Teacher, “Now, Reverend Sir, tell us where Devadatta was reborn.” “Monks, he was reborn in the Avīci hell.” “Reverend Sir, during his life here on earth he suffered, and when he went hence he was reborn in a place of suffering.” “Yes, monks, they that abide in Heedlessness, be they monks or laymen, suffer in both places.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[612]="***17. Here he suffers, after death he suffers; the evildoer suffers in both places.*";
P_HTM[613]="***He suffers to think, “I have done evil;” yet more does he suffer, gone to a place of suffering.*";
P_HTM[614]="*[13] 13. Sumanādevīvatthu**13. Lady Sumanā*";
P_HTM[615]="***18. Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices: he that has done good works rejoices in both places.*";
P_HTM[616]="***He rejoices to think, “I have done good works;” yet more does he rejoice, gone to a world of bliss.*";
P_HTM[617]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Lady Sumanā.*";
P_HTM[618]="***For every day two thousand monks take their meal in the house of Anāthapiṇḍika at Sāvatthi, and a like number in the house of the eminent female lay disciple Visākhā. Whoever desires to give alms at Sāvatthi, first seeks the good offices of these two lay disciples. Do you ask the reason for this? Suppose you are asked the question, “Has Anāthapiṇḍika or Visākhā given alms equal in amount to those which you have given?” and you answer, “They have not,” you may dispense a hundred thousand pieces of money in alms, and in spite of this the monks will murmur dissatisfaction, saying, “What kind of alms are these?” The explanation is that both of these lay disciples understand thoroughly the tastes of the Congregation of Monks and know exactly what is the proper thing to do; therefore all who desire to give alms take them with them when they go. And thus it happens that they are unable to minister to the monks in person in their own houses.*";
P_HTM[619]="***Under these circumstances Visākhā, considering within herself, “Who shall stand in my place and minister to the Congregation of Monks?” seeing the daughter of her son, appointed her to represent her; and thenceforth Visākhā’s granddaughter ministered to the Congregation of Monks in Visākhā’s residence. Anāthapiṇḍika appointed his oldest daughter Mahā Subhaddā; the latter showed the monks the customary attentions, hearkened to the Law, and as a result obtained the Fruit of Conversion; afterwards she married and went to live with her husband’s family. Then he appointed Culla Subhaddā, who followed her older sister’s example, obtaining the Fruit of Conversion, and afterwards marrying and going to live with the family of her husband. Finally he appointed his youngest daughter Sumanā. Sumanā obtained the Fruit of the Second Path, but remained unmarried. Overwhelmed with disappointment at her failure to obtain a husband, she refused to eat, and desiring to see her father, sent for him.*";
P_HTM[620]="***Anāthapiṇḍika was in the refectory when he received his daughter’s message, but immediately went to her and said, “What is it, dear daughter Sumanā?” Sumanā said to him, “What say you, dear youngest brother?” “You talk incoherently, dear daughter.” “I am not talking incoherently, youngest brother.” “Are you afraid, dear daughter?” “I am not afraid, youngest brother.” She said no more, but died immediately.*";
P_HTM[621]="***Although the treasurer had obtained the Fruit of Conversion, he was unable to bear the grief that arose within him. Accordingly, when he had performed the funeral rites over his daughter’s body, he went weeping to the Teacher. Said the Teacher, “Householder, how is it that you come to me sad and sorrowful, with tears in your eyes, weeping?” “Reverend Sir, my daughter Sumanā is dead.” “Well, why do you weep? Is not death certain for all?” “I know that, Reverend Sir. But my daughter was so modest and so conscientious. What grieves me so much is the thought that when she died, she was unable to recover her right mind, but died raving incoherently.”*";
P_HTM[622]="***“But what did your youngest daughter say, great treasurer?” “Reverend Sir, I addressed her as ‘dear Sumanā,’ and she replied, ‘What say you, dear youngest brother?’ Then I said to her, ‘You talk incoherently, dear daughter.’ ’ I am not talking incoherently, youngest brother.’ ‘Are you afraid, dear daughter?’ ‘I am not afraid, youngest brother.’ She said no more, but died immediately.”*";
P_HTM[623]="***Said the Exalted One to Anāthapiṇḍika, “Great treasurer, your daughter did not talk incoherently.” “But why did she speak thus?” “Solely because you were her youngest brother. Householder, your daughter was old in the Paths and the Fruits, for while you have attained but the Fruit of Conversion, your daughter had attained the Fruit of the Second Path. Thus it was, because she was old in the Paths and the Fruits, that she spoke thus.” “Was that the reason, Reverend Sir?” “That was the reason, householder.”*";
P_HTM[624]="***“Where has she now been reborn, Reverend Sir?” “In the World of the Tusita gods, householder.” “Reverend Sir, while my daughter remained here among her kinsfolk, she went about rejoicing, and when she went hence, she was reborn in the World of Joy.” Then the Teacher said to him, “It is even so, householder. They that are heedful, be they lay folk or religious, rejoice both in this world and in the world beyond.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[625]="***18. Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices: he that has done good works rejoices in both places.*";
P_HTM[626]="***He rejoices to think, “I have done good works;” yet more does he rejoice, gone to a world of bliss.*";

P_HTM[633]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to two fellow-monks.*";
P_HTM[634]="***For at Sāvatthi lived two young men of station who were inseparable friends. On a certain occasion they went to the monastery, heard the Teacher preach the Law, renounced the pleasures of the world, yielded the breast to the Religion of the Buddha, and became monks. When they had kept residence for five years with preceptors and teachers, they approached the Teacher and asked about the Duties in his Religion. After listening to a detailed description of the Duty of Meditation and of the Duty of Study, one of them said, “Reverend Sir, since I became a monk in old age, I shall not be able to fulfill the Duty of Study, but I can fulfill the Duty of Meditation.” So he had the Teacher instruct him in the Duty of Meditation as far as Arahatship, and after striving and struggling attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. But the other said, “I will fulfill the Duty of Study,” acquired by degrees the Tipiṭaka, the Word of the Buddha, and wherever he went, preached the Law and intoned it. He went from place to place reciting the Law to five hundred monks, and was preceptor of eighteen large communities of monks.*";
P_HTM[635]="***Now a company of monks, having obtained a Formula of Meditation from the Teacher, went to the place of residence of the older monk, and by faithful observance of his admonitions attained Arahatship. Thereupon they paid obeisance to the Elder and said, “We desire to see the Teacher.” Said the Elder, “Go, brethren, greet in my name the Teacher, and likewise greet the eighty Chief Elders, and greet my fellow-elder, saying, ‘Our Teacher greets you.’ ” So those monks went to the monastery and greeted the Teacher and the Elders, saying, “Reverend Sir, our teacher greets you.” When they greeted their teacher’s fellow-elder, he replied, “Who is he?” Said the monks, “He is your fellow-monk, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[636]="***Said the younger monk, “But what have you learned from him? Of the Dīgha Nikāya and the other Nikāyas, have you learned a single Nikāya? Of the Three Piṭakas, have you learned a single Piṭaka?” And he thought to himself, “This monk does not know a single Stanza containing four verses. As soon as he became a monk, he took rags from a dust-heap, entered the forest, and gathered a great many pupils about him. When he returns, it behooves me to ask him some questions.” Now somewhat later the older monk came to see the Teacher, and leaving his bowl and robe with his fellow-elder, went and greeted the Teacher and the eighty Chief Elders, afterwards returning to the place of residence of his fellow-elder. The younger monk showed him the customary attentions, provided him with a seat of the same size as his own, and then sat down, thinking to himself, “I will ask him a question.”*";
P_HTM[637]="***At that moment the Teacher thought to himself, “Should this monk annoy this my son, he is likely to be reborn in Hell.” So out of compassion for him, pretending to be going the rounds of the monastery, he went to the place where the two monks were sitting and sat down on the Seat of the Buddha already prepared. (For wherever the monks sit down, they first prepare the Seat of the Buddha, and not until they have so done do they themselves sit down. Therefore the Teacher sat down on a seat already prepared for him.) And when he had sat down, he asked the monk who had taken upon himself the Duty of Study a question on the First Trance. When the younger monk had answered this question correctly, the Teacher, beginning with the Second Trance, asked him questions about the Eight Attainments and about Form and the Formless World, all of which he answered correctly. Then the Teacher asked him a question about the Path of Conversion, and he was unable to answer it. Thereupon the Teacher asked the monk who was an Arahat, and the latter immediately gave the correct answer.*";
P_HTM[638]="***“Well done, well done, monk!” said the Teacher, greatly pleased. The Teacher then asked questions about the remaining Paths in order. The monk who had taken upon himself the Duty of Study was unable to answer a single question, while the monk who had attained unto Arahatship answered every question he asked. On each of four occasions the Teacher bestowed applause on him. Hearing this, all the deities, from the gods of earth to the gods of the World of Brahmā, including Nāgas and Garuḍas, shouted their applause.*";
P_HTM[639]="***Hearing this applause, the pupils and fellow-residents of the younger monk were offended at the Teacher and said, “Why did the Teacher do this? He bestowed applause on each of four occasions on the old monk who knows nothing at all. But to our own teacher, who knows all the Sacred Word by heart and is at the head of five hundred monks, he gave no praise at all.” The Teacher asked them, “Monks, what is it you are talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, your own teacher is in my Religion like a man who tends cows for hire. But my son is like a master who enjoys the five products of the cow at his own good pleasure.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";

From beginning to end the story is as follows:*";
P_HTM[654]="***Part 1. Birth and youthful career of Udena*";
P_HTM[655]="***Once upon a time King Allakappa ruled over the kingdom of Allakappa and King Veṭhadīpaka ruled over the kingdom of Veṭhadīpaka. They had been intimate friends since their boyhood-days and had received their education in the house of the same teacher. On the death of their fathers they raised the royal parasol and became rulers of kingdoms, each of which was ten leagues in extent.*";
P_HTM[656]="***As they met from time to time, and stood and sat and lay down to sleep together, and watched the multitudes being born into the world and dying again, they came to the conclusion, “When a man goes to the world beyond he can take nothing with him: he must leave everything behind him when he goes thither; even his own body does not follow him; of what use to us is the life of the householder? Let us retire from the world.”*";
P_HTM[657]="***Accordingly they resigned their kingdoms to son and wife, retired from the world, adopted the life of ascetics, and took up their residence in the Himālaya country. And they took counsel together, saying, “Although we have renounced our kingdoms and retired from the world, we shall encounter no difficulty in gaining a living; but if we reside together in the same place, our life will be quite unlike the life of ascetics; therefore let us live apart. You live on this mountain; I will live on that. Every fortnight, on fast-day, we will meet together.” Then this thought occurred to them, “Under this arrangement neither of us will be in regular communication with the other; but in order that each of us may know whether the other is living or not, you light a fire on your mountain, and I will light a fire on mine.” And this they did.*";
P_HTM[658]="***After a time the ascetic Veṭhadīpaka died and was reborn as a prince of deities of mighty power. A fortnight later Allakappa saw no fire on the mountain and knew that his comrade was dead. As soon as ever Veṭhadīpaka was reborn, he surveyed his own heavenly glory, considered the deeds of his former existence, reviewed the austerities he had performed from the day when he retired from the world, and said to himself, “I will go see my comrade.” Accordingly he laid aside his form as a deity, disguised himself as a wayfarer, went to Allakappa, paid obeisance to him, and stood respectfully on one side.*";
P_HTM[659]="***Allakappa said to him, “Whence have you come?” “I am a wayfarer, Reverend Sir; I have come a long distance. But, Reverend Sir, does your honor reside entirely alone in this place? Is there no one else here?” “I have a single comrade.” “Where is he?” “He resides on that mountain; but as he failed to light a fire on fast-day, I know he must be dead.” “Is that so, Reverend Sir?” “That is so, brother.” “I am he, Reverend Sir.” “Where were you reborn?” “Reverend Sir, I was reborn in the World of the Gods as a prince of deities of mighty power. I have returned to see your honor. Does your honorable self reside in this place undisturbed, or are you subject to some annoyance?” “Yes, brother, I am bothered to death by the elephants.” “Reverend Sir, what do the elephants do to trouble you?” “They drop dung on the ground I have swept clean, and they stamp with their feet and kick up the dust. What with removing the dung and smoothing the ground, I am all worn out.” “Well, would you like to keep them away?” “Yes, brother.” “Well then, I will provide you with means whereby you can keep them away.”*";
P_HTM[660]="***Accordingly Veṭhadīpaka gave Allakappa a lute to charm elephants with and likewise taught him spells for charming elephants. Now as he presented the lute to him, he showed him three strings and taught him three spells. “Strike this string,” said he, “and utter this spell, and the elephants will turn and run away without so much as daring even to look at you; strike this string and utter this spell, and they will turn and run away, eyeing you at every step; strike this string and utter this spell, and the leader of the herd will come up and offer you his back. Now do as you like.” With these words he departed. Thereafter the ascetic lived in peace, driving the elephants away by uttering the proper spell and striking the proper string.*";
P_HTM[661]="***At this time Parantapa was king of Kosambi. One day he was sitting out in the open air basking himself in the rays of the newly risen sun, and beside him sat his queen, great with child. The queen was wearing the king’s cloak, a crimson blanket worth a hundred thousand pieces of money; and as she sat there conversing with the king she removed from the king’s finger the royal signet, worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, and slipped it on her own.*";
P_HTM[662]="***Just at that moment a monster bird with a bill as big as an elephant’s trunk came soaring through the air. Seeing the queen and mistaking her for a piece of meat, he spread his wings and swooped down. When the king heard the bird swoop down, he sprang to his feet and entered the royal palace. But the queen, because she was great with child and because she was of a timid nature, was unable to make haste. The bird pounced upon her, caught her up in the cage of his talons, and soared away with her into the air. (These birds are said to possess the strength of five elephants; they are therefore able to convey their victims through the air, settle wherever they wish, and devour their flesh.)*";
P_HTM[663]="***As the queen was being carried away by the bird, terrified though she was with the fear of death, she preserved her presence of mind and thought to herself, “Animals stand in great fear of the human voice. Therefore if I cry out, this bird will drop me the instant he hears the sound of my voice. But in that case I should accomplish only my own destruction and that of my unborn child. If, however, I wait until he settles somewhere and begins to eat, then I can make a noise and frighten him away.” Through her own wisdom, therefore, she kept patience and endured.*";
P_HTM[664]="***Now there stood at that time in the Himālaya country a banyan-tree which, although of brief growth, had attained great size and was like a pavilion in form; and to this tree that bird was accustomed to convey the carcasses of wild animals and eat them. To this very tree, therefore, the bird conveyed the queen, lodged her in a fork of the tree, and watched the path leading to the tree. (It is the nature of these birds, we are told, to watch the path leading to their tree.) At that moment the queen, thinking to herself, “Now is the time to frighten him away,” raised both her hands, clapped them together and shouted, and frightened the bird away.*";
P_HTM[665]="***At sunset the pains of travail came upon her, and at the same time from all the four quarters of heaven arose a great storm. The delicate queen, half dead with suffering, with no one beside her to say to her, “Fear not, lady,” slept not at all throughout the night. As the night grew bright, the clouds scattered, the dawn came, and her child was born at one and the same moment. Because the child was born at the time (utu) of a storm, at the time when she was upon a mountain, and at the time when the sun rose, she named her son Udena.*";
P_HTM[666]="***Not far from that tree was the place of residence of the ascetic Allakappa. Now on rainy days it was the custom of the ascetic not to go into the forest for fruits and berries, for fear of the cold. Instead he used to go to the foot of the tree and gather up the bones from which the birds had picked the flesh; then he would pound the bones, make broth of them, and drink the broth. On that very day, therefore, he went there to get bones. As he was picking up bones at the foot of the tree, he heard the voice of a child in the branches above.*";
P_HTM[667]="***Looking up, he saw the queen. “Who are you?” said he. “I am a woman.” “How did you get there?” “A monster bird brought me here.” “Come down,” said he. “Your honor, I am afraid to come down on account of difference of caste.” “Of what caste are you?” “Of the Warrior caste.” “I am also of the Warrior caste.” “Well then, give me the password of the Warrior caste.” He did so. “Well then, climb up and set down my boy.” Finding a way to climb the tree on one side, he climbed up and took the boy in his arms; obeying the queen’s behest not to touch her with his hand, he set the boy down; then the queen herself came down.*";
P_HTM[668]="***The ascetic conducted the queen along the path to his hermitage and cared for her tenderly without in any way violating his vow of chastity. He brought honey free from flies and gave it to her; he brought rice grown in his own field and prepared broth and gave it to her. Thus did he minister to her needs.*";
P_HTM[669]="***After a time she thought to herself, “For my part I know neither the way to come nor the way to go, nor can I repose absolute confidence even in this ascetic. Now if he were to leave us and go elsewhere, we should both perish right here. I must by some means seduce him to violate his vow of chastity, so that he will not abandon us. Accordingly she displayed herself before him with under and upper garments in disarray, and thus seduced him to violate his vow of chastity; thenceforth the two lived together.*";
P_HTM[670]="***One day, as the ascetic was observing a conjunction of a constellation with one of the lunar mansions, he saw the occultation of Parantapa’s star. “My lady,” said he, “Parantapa, king of Kosambi, is dead.” “Noble sir, why do you speak thus? Why do you bear ill-will against him?” “I bear him no ill-will, my lady. I say this because I have just seen the occultation of his star.” She burst into tears. “Why do you weep?” he asked. Then she told him that Parantapa was her own husband. The ascetic replied, “Weep not, my lady; whoever is born is certain to die.” “I know that, noble sir.” “Then why do you weep?” “I weep, noble sir, because it pains me to think, ‘To my son belongs the sovereignty by right of succession; had he been there, he would have raised the white parasol; now he has become one of the common herd.’ ” “Never mind, my lady; be not disturbed. If you desire that he shall receive the sovereignty, I will devise some means by which he shall receive it.” Accordingly the ascetic gave the boy the lute to charm elephants with and likewise taught him the spells for charming elephants.*";
P_HTM[671]="***Now at that time many thousands of elephants came and sat at the foot of the banyan-tree. So the ascetic said to the boy, “Climb the tree before the elephants come, and when they come, utter this spell and strike this string, and they will all turn and run away, without even so much as daring to look at you; then descend and come to me.” The boy did as he was told, and then went and told the ascetic. On the second day the ascetic said to him, “To-day utter this spell and strike this string, if you please, and they will turn and run away, eyeing you at every step.” On that day also the boy did as he was told, and then went and told the ascetic.*";
P_HTM[672]="***Then the ascetic addressed the mother, saying, “My lady, give your son his message and he will go hence and become king.” So she addressed her son, saying, “You must say, ‘I am the son of King Parantapa of Kosambi; a monster bird carried me off.’ Then you must utter the names of the commander-in-chief and the other generals. If they still refuse to believe you, you must show them this blanket which was your father’s cloak and this signet-ring which he wore on his finger.” With these words she dismissed him.*";
P_HTM[673]="***The boy said to the ascetic, “Now what shall I do?” The ascetic replied, “Seat yourself on the lowest branch of the tree, utter this spell and strike this string, and the leader of the elephants will approach and offer you his back. Seat yourself on his back, go to your kingdom, and take the sovereignty.” The boy did reverence to his parents, and following the instructions of the ascetic, seated himself on the back of the elephant and whispered in his ear, “I am the son of King Parantapa of Kosambi. Get me and give me the sovereignty which I have inherited from my father.” When the elephant heard that, he trumpeted, “Let many thousands of elephants assemble;” and many thousands of elephants assembled. Again a second time he trumpeted, “Let the old, weak elephants retire;” and the old, weak elephants retired. The third time he trumpeted, “Let those that are very young retire;” and they also retired.*";
P_HTM[674]="***So the boy went forth, surrounded by many thousands of warrior-elephants, and reaching a village on the frontier, proclaimed, “I am the son of the king; let those who desire worldly prosperity come with me.” Levying forces as he proceeded, he invested the city and sent the following message to the citizens, “Give me battle or the kingdom.” The citizens answered, “We will give neither. Our queen was carried off by a monster bird when she was great with child, and we know not whether she is alive or dead. So long as we hear no news of her, we will give neither battle nor the kingdom.” (At that time, we are told, the kingdom was handed down from father to son.) Thereupon the boy said, “I am her son.” So saying, he uttered the names of the commander-in-chief and the other generals, and when they still refused to believe him, showed the blanket and the ring. They recognized the blanket and the ring, opened the gates, and sprinkled him king.*";
P_HTM[675]="***Part 2. Birth and youthful career of Ghosaka*";
P_HTM[676]="***Story of the Past: Kotūhalaka casts away his son*";
P_HTM[677]="***Once upon a time there was a famine in the kingdom of Ajita, and a man named Kotūhalaka, unable to get a living, took his young son Kāpi and his wife Kāḷi, and thinking, “I will go to Kosambi and get a living there,” set out with provisions for the journey. (There are also those who say that he left his home because the people were dying of intestinal disease.) As they proceeded on their journey, their provisions gave out, and finally they were so overcome with hunger that they were not able to carry the boy. Thereupon the husband said to his wife, “Wife, if we live, we shall have another son. Let us cast this child away and continue our journey alone.”*";
P_HTM[678]="***There is a proverb, “A mother’s heart is tender,” and so it was with this woman. She replied, “I could never cast away a living child.” “Well, what shall we do?” “Carry him by turns.” When the mother’s turn came, she would lift the child like a wreath of flowers, clasp him to her breast, or carry him on her hip, finally giving him back to his father. When the father took the child, no matter where he held him he suffered more intense pain than ever from hunger. Again and again he said to his wife, “Wife, if we live, we shall have another son. Let us cast this child away.” But this the mother steadfastly refused to do.*";
P_HTM[679]="***Finally the child became so tired from being passed back and forth that he fell asleep in the arms of his father. When the father observed that he was asleep, allowing the mother to precede him, he went and laid the child on a couch of leaves under a bush, immediately resuming his journey. The mother turned, looked back, and not seeing the child, asked, “Husband, where is my son?” “I laid him down under a certain bush.” “Husband, do not kill me. Without my son I cannot live. Bring my son back to me.” And she smote upon her breast and wept. So the husband retraced his steps, recovered the child, and brought him back to her. (In consequence of having cast away his child on this one occasion, Kotūhalaka was himself cast away seven times in a later existence. Let no one regard an evil deed lightly, saying, “It is only a small matter.”)*";
P_HTM[680]="***Continuing their journey, they came to the house of a certain herdsman. On that day, as it happened, one of the herdsman’s cows had calved, and the herdsman was about to hold the customary festival in honor of the event. Now a certain Private Buddha was accustomed to take his meals in the house of the hersdman. The herdsman, after providing the Private Buddha with food, celebrated the cow-festival with an abundant supply of rice-porridge. When the herdsman saw the visitors, he asked them, “Whence have you come?” They told him the whole story, whereupon the tender-hearted youth took pity on them and saw to it that they were given rice-porridge with a plentiful supply of ghee. The wife said to the husband, “Husband, if only you can live, I can live. For a long time you have not had sufficient food. Now eat to your heart’s content.” So saying, she set the ghee and curds before him, eating only a little of the ghee herself. The husband ate heartily; but so intense was the hunger from which he had suffered during the preceding seven or eight days that he was unable to satisfy it.*";
P_HTM[681]="***When the herdsman had seen to it that they were provided with rice-porridge, he began himself to eat. Now under the herdsman’s stool lay a bitch he had raised, and as the herdsman sat there eating, he fed her with morsels of rice-porridge. Kotūhalaka watched him feed her and thought to himself, “Fortunate indeed is that bitch to get such food to eat!” Kotūhalaka was unable to digest the rice-porridge he had eaten, died during the night, and received a new existence in the womb of that very bitch.*";
P_HTM[682]="***His wife performed the funeral ceremonies over his body, and remaining in that very house, worked for hire. Receiving a pint-pot of rice, she cooked it and placed it in the bowl of the Private Buddha, saying, “May these grains of rice bring a reward to your servant.” And she thought to herself, “It would be well for me to remain right here. The Private Buddha comes here regularly; and whether there be alms or not, I shall have the privilege of paying obeisance to him each day and of ministering to him. By so doing I shall obtain peace of mind and earn much merit.” And she remained right there working for hire.*";
P_HTM[683]="***After six or seven months the bitch gave birth to a single pup. The herdsman reserved the milk of one cow for the pup, and in no long time he grew to be a fine big dog. When the Private Buddha ate his meal, he invariably gave him a portion of his rice; and because of this the dog became deeply attached to the Private Buddha.*";
P_HTM[684]="***Now the herdsman was accustomed to go regularly twice each day to wait upon the Private Buddha, and the dog always went with him. On the way was a lair of wild beasts, and the herdsman used to frighten the wild beasts away by striking bushes and ground with a stick and calling out three times, “Su! su!” One day he said to the Private Buddha, “Reverend Sir, in case at any time I should be unable to come, I will send this dog for you. Therefore if I send him, please understand that I wish you to come.”*";
P_HTM[685]="***A few days later the herdsman found it inconvenient to go in person. He therefore sent the dog in his place, saying, “Boy, go bring his reverence back.” At the mere word of the herdsman the dog started off. Where he had seen his master stop and strike bushes and ground, the dog also stopped and barked three times; and when he was sure that his barking had frightened away the wild beasts, he went on. Early in the morning, having attended to nature’s needs, he entered the hut of leaves and grass, went to the place where the Private Buddha sat, barked three times by way of announcing his arrival, and then lay down at one side. By this the Private Buddha knew that it was time for him to go, and therefore started out. The dog ran before him, barking constantly. From time to time the Private Buddha tested the dog by taking the wrong path; but every time he did so the dog, by standing across the path and barking, intimated to him to take the other path.*";
P_HTM[686]="***One day the Private Buddha took the wrong path, and when the dog tried to stop him, without turning back, he pushed away the dog with his foot and went on. The dog, perceiving that he did not intend to turn back, took the hem of his undergarment in his teeth and dragged him along until he brought him to the right path. Such was the strength of the affection of the dog for the Private Buddha.*";
P_HTM[687]="***Later on the Private Buddha’s robe wore out. When the herdsman provided him with materials for a new set of robes, the Private Buddha said to him, “Brother, it is difficult for a person all alone to make a robe. I will go to a convenient place and have it made for me.” “Make it right here, Reverend Sir.” “No, brother, I cannot.” “Well then, Reverend Sir, do not take up your residence far from here.” The dog stood listening to every word they said. The Private Buddha said, “Wait a moment, brother.” Thereupon, leaving the herdsman behind, he flew up into the air and departed in the direction of Gandhamādana.*";
P_HTM[688]="***When the dog saw him flying through the air, he began to bark and howl, and he kept this up until the Private Buddha gradually faded from view, whereupon his heart broke. (Animals, they say, are straightforward and not given to deceit; men, however, think one thing in their heart, but say another with their lips. Therefore said the Exalted One to a monk, “The ways of men are past finding out, but the ways of the beasts are easy to discover.”) So when the dog died, he was reborn, because of his straightforwardness and lack of deceit, in the World of the Thirty-three with a retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs, and there he enjoyed glory and bliss unspeakable. When he but whispered, his voice carried a distance of sixteen leagues; when he spoke in an ordinary tone, he could be heard all over the city of the gods, a city ten thousand leagues in extent. (Do you ask, “Of what was this the consequence?” It was because he barked and howled for love of the Private Buddha.)*";
P_HTM[689]="***Remaining in the World of the Thirty-three for no long time, he passed from that state of existence. (Deities pass from the World of the Gods through four causes: exhaustion of life, exhaustion of merit, exhaustion of food, and anger. He that has earned much merit is reborn in the World of the Gods, remains there during the term allotted to him, and is then reborn higher and higher. Thus he passes through “exhaustion of life.” He that has earned little merit soon exhausts that merit, just as three or four pint-pots of rice tossed into a royal storehouse disappear; and he therefore soon dies. Thus he passes through “exhaustion of merit.” Still a third, while enjoying the pleasures of sense, fails through confusion of memory to partake of food, and the strength of his body being thereby impaired, dies. Thus he passes through “exhaustion of food.” A fourth, jealous of the glory of another, becomes angry and dies. Thus he passes through “anger.”)*";
P_HTM[690]="***Story of the Present: Ghosaka is cast away seven times*";
P_HTM[691]="***Ghosaka, while enjoying the pleasures of sense, became forgetful, passed, through exhaustion of food, from the World of the Thirty-three, and was conceived in the womb of a courtezan of Kosambi. On the day when the courtezan gave birth to the child, she asked her slave-woman, “What is it?” “A son, my lady.” “Very well, put this boy into an old winnowing basket and cast him away on the dust-heap.” Thus she caused him to be cast away. (Courtezans will bestow care on a daughter, but not on a son, for it is through a daughter that their line of business is maintained.) Crows and dogs surrounded the child and huddled about him; but in consequence of his barking and howling for love of the Private Buddha, not one dared to approach him.*";
P_HTM[692]="***At that moment a man came out and saw the crows and dogs all huddled together. “What does this mean?” thought he to himself, going nearer. When he saw the boy, he immediately took a fancy to him, and saying to himself, “I have gained a son,” he picked the boy up and took him home with him.*";
P_HTM[693]="***Now the treasurer of Kosambi happened at that time to go to the royal palace. Seeing the house-priest returning from the royal residence, he asked him, “Teacher, have you observed a conjunction of a constellation with one of the lunar mansions to-day?” “Yes, great treasurer. What else have we to do?” “What will happen to the country?” “Only this: a boy has been born in this city to-day who will one day become the principal treasurer.” As the treasurer’s wife was at that time great with child, he immediately sent a messenger to his house, saying, “Go find out whether or not she has given birth to a child.”*";
P_HTM[694]="***He received the answer that she had not yet given birth to a child. Therefore, as soon as he had seen the king, he went home quickly, summoned a slave-woman named Kāḷī, gave her a thousand pieces of money, and said, “Go scour this city, find the boy that was born to-day, and bring him hither to me.” While she was scouring the city, she came to the house where the child was and asked the mistress of the house, “When was this boy born?” “To-day.” “Give him to me,” said she, first offering a penny and gradually increasing the amount until finally, by offering a thousand pieces of money, she obtained him. Then she took him with her and presented him to the treasurer.*";
P_HTM[695]="***The treasurer gave him a home in his house, thinking to himself, “If a daughter is born to me, I will marry her to this boy and make him treasurer; but if a son is born to me, I will kill him.” After a few days his wife gave birth to a son. Thereupon the treasurer thought to himself, “If only this foundling did not exist, my own son would obtain the post of treasurer. I had best kill him immediately.” So he said to Kāḷī, “Carry this child to the cattle-pen, and when it is time for the cattle to come out, lay him across the doorway, and the cattle will trample him to death. Observe whether or not they trample him to death, and then come back and tell me.”*";
P_HTM[696]="***She carried the child to the cattle-pen, and as soon as the door was opened, laid him across the doorway. Now at other times the leader of the herd, the bull, came out last of all; but on this particular day he came out first, inclosed the boy with his four feet, and stood stock still. Several hundred cows came out on either side of the bull, rubbing against his flanks as they passed. The herdsman thought to himself, “Hitherto this bull has always gone out last of all, but to-day he went out first and stood stock still in the doorway of the pen. What can this mean?” Going near, he saw the boy lying under the bull. Immediately taking a fancy to him, he said to himself, “I have gained a son,” and picking him up, he carried him home.*";
P_HTM[697]="***Kāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened. Said the treasurer, “Go to the herdsman, give him these thousand pieces of money, and bring the child back to me again.” So she brought the child back again and gave him to the treasurer. Then he said to her, “Good Kāḷī, five hundred carts start from this city at dawn on a trading expedition. Take this child and lay him in the track of the wheels. Either the oxen will trample him under their feet or the wheels will crush him to death. Observe what happens to him, and then return to me.”*";
P_HTM[698]="***She took the child and laid him down in the track of the wheels. The leader of the caravan came first; but when his oxen reached the place where the child lay, they threw off the yoke. Again and again the leader replaced the yoke and tried to drive the oxen forwards; but as often as he did so, they threw off the yoke and refused to move. He was still struggling with them when the sun rose. “Why have the oxen acted thus?” thought he. He looked at the road and saw the boy. “Oh, what a grievous wrong I have done!” thought he. His heart was filled with joy at the thought, “I have gained a son,” and picking up the boy, he carried him off.*";
P_HTM[699]="***Kāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened. Said the treasurer, “Go to the caravan-leader, give him a thousand pieces of money, and bring the child back to me again.” When she had so done, he said to her, “Now carry him to the burning-ground and lay him in the bushes. There he will either be eaten by dogs or attacked by demons, and he will die. As soon as you know whether or not he is dead, return to me.”*";
P_HTM[700]="***She took the child, laid him in the bushes, and stood at one side. But neither dog nor crow nor demon dared to approach him. (Pray, if he had neither mother nor father nor brother nor other kinsman to protect him, what was it that did protect him? All that protected him was his howling for love of the Private Buddha in his former existence as a dog.)*";
P_HTM[701]="***Just then a goatherd passed on one side of the burning-ground, leading several thousand goats to pasture. A certain she-goat made her way into the bushes eating leaves and grass, and seeing the boy, knelt down and gave him suck. The goatherd called, “He! he!” but she did not come out. Thereupon he said to himself, “I will beat her with my stick and bring her out.” So saying, he made his way into the bushes. And there he saw the she-goat on her knees, giving suck to the boy. He immediately took a fancy to the boy, and saying to himself, “I have gained a son,” picked him up and carried him off.*";
P_HTM[702]="***Kāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened. Said the treasurer, “Go to the goatherd, give him a thousand pieces of money, and bring the child back to me again.” When she had so done, he said to her, “Good Kāḷī, take this child with you, climb the mountain that is known as Robbers’ Cliff, and throw him down the precipice. He will strike against the sides of the ravine and be dashed to pieces when he reaches the bottom. As soon as you know whether or not he is dead, return to me.”*";
P_HTM[703]="***She carried the child to Robbers’ Cliff, and standing at the top of the mountain, threw him down. Now there grew along the mountain near that abyss a dense bamboo thicket, and the top of the mountain was covered with a thick growth of guñjā shrub. As the boy fell, he dropped into this bamboo thicket as into a coverlet of goat’s hair. Now that very day the leader of the reed-makers had received a gift of bamboo and accompanied by his son, he had gone to chop that thicket down. As he began his work, the bamboo shook and the boy cried out. “That sounds like the voice of a boy,” thought he. Climbing up on one side, he saw the boy. His heart was filled with joy at the thought, “I have gained a son,” and picking up the boy, he carried him off.*";
P_HTM[704]="***Kāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened. Said the treasurer, “Go to the reed-maker, give him a thousand pieces of money, and bring the child back to me again.” She did so. But in spite of the treasurer’s attempts on his life, the child lived and thrived and grew to manhood. Ghosaka was his name. He was like a thorn in the eye of the treasurer, who could not look him straight in the face.*";
P_HTM[705]="***Thinking of a way to kill him, the treasurer went to a friend of his who was a potter and asked him, “When are you going to fire your bake-house?” “To-morrow.” “Well then, take these thousand pieces of money and do a job for me.” “What is it, master?” “I have a single base-born son. I will send him to you. Take him into an inner room, chop him to pieces with a sharp axe, throw him into a chatty, and bake him in the bake-house. Here are a thousand pieces of money, to seal the bargain, as it were. But in addition I will reward you suitably later.” “Very well,” said the potter, consenting to the bargain.*";
P_HTM[706]="***On the following day the treasurer summoned Ghosaka and sent him to the potter, saying, “Yesterday I left an order with the potter to do a certain piece of work for me. Go say to him, ‘Finish the job my father gave you yesterday.’ ” “Very well,” said Ghosaka, and set out.*";
P_HTM[707]="***As Ghosaka was on his way to the potter’s, the treasurer’s other son, who was playing marbles with some boys, saw him. And calling to him, he asked, “Where are you going?” “I am carrying a message to the potter for father.” “Let me go there. These boys have won a big stake from me. You win it back and give it to me.” “I am afraid of father.” “Do not fear, brother; I will carry that message. I have lost a big stake. You play until I return again, and win the stake back for me.”*";
P_HTM[708]="***(We are told that Ghosaka was skillful at shooting marbles, and that for this reason his foster-brother was so insistent.)*";
P_HTM[709]="***So Ghosaka consented to let his foster-brother go in his place, saying, “Well then, go to the potter and say to him, ‘Finish the job my father gave you yesterday.’ ” Thus it happened that the treasurer’s own son carried the message to the potter. The potter killed him according to the letter of the directions he had received from the treasurer and threw his body into the bake-house. Ghosaka played marbles all day and went home in the evening. “You have returned home, son?” queried the treasurer. Ghosaka then told him the reason why he had himself returned home and let his younger brother go to the potter.*";
P_HTM[710]="***“Woe is me!” cried the treasurer with a loud voice. He looked as though the blood had been drawn from his veins. He rushed to the potter, wringing his hands and wailing, “Oh, potter, do not kill me! do not kill me!” The potter saw him approaching in this wise and said to him, “Master, make no noise; the job is done.” Thus was the treasurer overwhelmed with sorrow as with a mountain. Thus did he suffer great grief, even as do all who offend against those that are without offense. Therefore said the Exalted One,*";
P_HTM[711]="***137. Whosoever visits punishment on those that deserve not punishment.*";
P_HTM[712]="***Whosoever offends against those that are without offense.*";
P_HTM[713]="***Such an one will right quickly come to one of ten states:*";
P_HTM[714]="***138. He will incur cruel suffering, or infirmity, or injury of the body.*";
P_HTM[715]="***Or severe sickness, or loss of mind,*";
P_HTM[716]="***139. Or misfortune proceeding from the king, or a heavy accusation.*";
P_HTM[717]="***Or death of relatives, or loss of treasures,*";
P_HTM[718]="***140. Or else the fire of lightning will consume his houses;*";
P_HTM[719]="***Upon dissolution of the body such a fool will go to Hell.*";
P_HTM[720]="***Now under these circumstances the treasurer was unable to look Ghosaka straight in the face. “How can I manage to kill him?” thought he. Finally he thought of a way. “I will send him to the superintendent of my hundred villages and order him to kill him,” said he to himself. Accordingly he wrote the following letter to the superintendent, “This is my base-born son. Kill him and throw him into the cesspool. Let this be done, and I shall know how to reward my uncle properly.” Then he said to his foster-son, “Dear Ghosaka, there is a superintendent over our hundred villages. Take this letter and give it to him.” So saying, he fastened the letter to the hem of his garment. (Now Ghosaka did not know how to read and write, for ever since he was a boy the treasurer had striven, although without success, to kill him. Why, therefore, should he have taught him to read and write?) As Ghosaka set out with his own death-warrant fastened to the hem of his garment, he said to his father, “Father, I have no provisions for the journey.” “You have no need of provisions for the journey. On the way, in such and such a village, lives a friend of mine who is a treasurer. Obtain your breakfast at his house, and then continue your journey.” “Very well,” said Ghosaka, and bowing to his father, set out on his journey.*";
P_HTM[721]="***When he arrived at the village, he inquired where the treasurer’s house was, went there, and saw the treasurer’s wife. “Whence have you come?” she inquired. “From the city,” he replied. “Whose son are you?” “I am the son of your friend the treasurer, my lady.” “Then you are Ghosaka.” “Yes, my lady.” She fell in love with him at first sight. Now the treasurer had a daughter about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and she was exceedingly beautiful and fair to look upon. In order to keep her safe and sound, her parents lodged her on the topmost floor of a seven-storied palace in an apartment of royal splendor, giving her a single slave-girl to run errands. At that moment the treasurer’s daughter sent this slave-girl to a shop. The treasurer’s wife, seeing her, asked, “Where are you going?” “On an errand for your daughter, my lady.” “Just come here a moment. Never mind the errand. Spread a seat for my son, bathe his feet, anoint them with oil, and then spread a couch for him. After you have done this, you may do your errand.” The slave-girl did as she was told.*";
P_HTM[722]="***When she returned, the treasurer’s daughter scolded her for her long absence. The slave-girl replied, “Be not angry with me. The treasurer’s son Ghosaka has arrived, and I had to do this and that for him, besides going on an errand for you, before I returned.” When the treasurer’s daughter heard the name “treasurer’s son Ghosaka,” love suffused her body, cleaving her skin and penetrating the marrow of her bones.*";
P_HTM[723]="***(For she had been his wife in his former existence as Kotūhalaka and had given a pint-pot of rice to the Private Buddha. And through his supernatural power she had been reborn in the household of the treasurer. No wonder her old passion for him returned and overwhelmed her! Therefore said the Exalted One,*";
P_HTM[724]="***Through previous association or present advantage,*";
P_HTM[725]="***That love springs up like a lily in the water.)*";
P_HTM[726]="***The treasurer’s daughter said to the slave-girl, “Girl, where is he?” “He is lying asleep on the couch.” “Has he anything in his hand?” “There is a letter fastened to his garment.” “What can be in this letter?” she thought. So while Ghosaka was asleep, and her mother and father were otherwise engaged, she came down without attracting their attention, detached the letter from his garment, took it with her, went into her room, closed the door, opened the window, and through her knowledge of writing read the letter. “Oh!” she exclaimed, “the simpleton is going about with his own death-warrant fastened to his garment. Had I not seen it, he would surely have been killed.”*";
P_HTM[727]="***So she tore up this letter and wrote another in the name of the treasurer as follows, “This is my son Ghosaka. Procure presents for him from my hundred villages. Prepare a festival in honor of his marriage with the daughter of this district-treasurer. Build him a two-storied house in the center of the village wherein he resides. Surround his house with a wall and with a guard of men, and so provide him with ample protection. Then send me a message, saying, ‘I have done thus and so,’ and I shall know how to reward my uncle properly.” Having written the letter, she folded it up and fastened it to the hem of his garment.*";
P_HTM[728]="***After sleeping all day, Ghosaka arose, ate his meal, and went on his way. Early on the morning of the following day he arrived at that village and saw the superintendent performing his village duties. When the superintendent saw him, he asked him, “What is it, dear Ghosaka?” “My father has sent you a letter.” “What is it about, dear Ghosaka? Bring it to me.” He took the letter and read it, and then said with an exclamation of delight, “See, men, how my master loves me. He has sent me a message, saying, ‘Prepare a festival in honor of my oldest son.’ Bring wood and other building materials immediately.” Having thus given orders to the householders, he caused a house of the kind described in the letter to be erected in the center of the village, had presents brought from the hundred villages, conducted the daughter of the district-treasurer thither, celebrated the marriage festival, and then sent word to the treasurer, saying, “I have done thus and so.”*";
P_HTM[729]="***When the treasurer received the message, he said, “What I would do, that I do not; what I would not do, that I do.” Disappointment over the failure of his latest plan, together with sorrow over the death of his own son, set him on fire within and produced diarrhea.*";
P_HTM[730]="***The treasurer’s daughter gave orders, saying, “Should anyone come here from the treasurer, tell me before you tell the treasurer’s son.” The treasurer said to himself, “At any rate I will not make this rascally son of mine heir to my property.” With this thought in mind he said to a certain official, “Uncle, I wish to see my son. Send a servant and summon my son.” “Very well,” replied the official, and giving a certain man the letter, sent him away.*";
P_HTM[731]="***When the treasurer’s daughter heard that the servant had arrived and was standing at the door, she sent for him and asked him, “What is it, my man?” “The treasurer is sick and wishes to see his son, and has therefore sent for him, my lady.” “My man, is he strong or weak?” “He is still strong, my lady, and able to take nourishment.” Without letting the treasurer’s son know, she ordered that the man should be given lodging and expenses and said to him, “You may go when I send you. Remain here for the present.”*";
P_HTM[732]="***Again the treasurer addressed the official, “Uncle, did you not send a messenger to my son?” “I did, master, but the man who went has not yet returned.” “Well then, try again and send another.” So the official sent another man, and the treasurer’s daughter treated him just as she had the first. The treasurer’s condition grew worse; one chamber-pot went in and another came out. Again the treasurer asked the official, “Uncle, did you not send a messenger to my son?” “I did, master, but the man who went has not yet returned.” “Well then, try again and send another.” So the official sent another man. When the third messenger arrived, the treasurer’s daughter asked him the news. “The treasurer is a very sick man, my lady. He refuses to eat and is confined to his bed. One chamber-pot comes out and another goes in.”*";
P_HTM[733]="***“Now it is time to go,” thought the treasurer’s daughter. So she said to the treasurer’s son, “I learn that your father is sick.” “Wife, what say you?” “It may be only a slight ailment, husband.” “What is to be done now?” “Let us take presents from his hundred villages and go see him.” “Very well,” said he. Having caused presents to be brought, he started out, conveying the presents in a cart. Then she said to him, “Your father is very weak. If we take all these presents, we shall be delayed on the way; send them back.” Having sent all the presents back to their own house, she said to the treasurer’s son, “Husband, please stand at your father’s feet; I will stand beside his pillow.” And as they entered the house, she gave orders to her own men, “Stand on guard both in the front of the house and in the rear.” And when they had entered, the treasurer’s son took his stand at his father’s feet and his wife beside his pillow.*";
P_HTM[734]="***At that moment the treasurer was lying on his back and the official was rubbing his feet. The latter said to him, “Master, your son has arrived.” “Where is he?” “Here he is, standing at your feet.” When the treasurer saw his son, he sent for the receiver of his revenues and asked him, “How much wealth is there in my house?” “Master, of money alone there are four hundred millions; as for objects for employment and enjoyment, such as villages and fields and men and animals and wagons and carriages, such and such is the total.” It was the treasurer’s intention to say, “All of this wealth I do not give to my son Ghosaka.” But instead of this he said, “I do give.”*";
P_HTM[735]="***When the treasurer’s daughter heard this, she thought to herself, “However, if this man should speak again, he might say something very different.” Accordingly, pretending to be overcome with grief, she disheveled her hair, burst into tears, and said, “Dear father, do you really mean this? In spite of these words of yours, which we hear, we are indeed unfortunate.” So saying, she fell on him, struck the middle of his breast with the crown of her head, and in order that he might not be able to speak again, rubbed the middle of his breast with the crown of her head, displaying at the same time signs of profound grief. At that very moment the treasurer died.*";
P_HTM[736]="***They went and informed King Udena of his death. The king had the funeral ceremonies performed over his body and asked, “Has he any son or daughter?” “Your majesty, he has a son named Ghosaka; and, your majesty, he bestowed all his property on him before he died.” Some time afterwards, the king sent for the treasurer’s son. Now that day it rained, and there were pools of water here and there in the palace court. The treasurer’s son set out to see the king. The king opened his window and watched him as he approached, noticing that as he crossed the palace court he leaped over the pools of water that stood in the court. When he reached the palace and paid obeisance to the king and stood before him, the king asked him, “Your name is Ghosaka?” “Yes, your majesty.” The king comforted him, saying, “Do not grieve at the thought that your father is dead. I will give you alone your father’s post as treasurer.” Then he dismissed him, saying, “Now, dear Ghosaka, you may go,” and stood and watched him as he left the palace.*";
P_HTM[737]="***Now whereas Ghosaka leaped over the water in approaching the palace, he walked through it on his return. The king sent orders for him to return from where he was and asked him, “Dear Ghosaka, is it a fact that whereas, in coming to me, you leaped over the water, on your return you walk through it?” “It is even so, your majesty. Then I was a boy and was fond of play, but now I have been promised a post of honor by your majesty. Therefore I must now lay aside my former ways and deport myself with modesty and dignity.” On hearing this, the king thought to himself, “There is a wise man. I will give him the post immediately.” Accordingly he gave him the wealth formerly possessed by his father and the post of treasurer, together with all the hundred villages. Then Ghosaka mounted his chariot and drove sunwise round the city. Every place he looked at quaked and trembled.*";
P_HTM[738]="***The treasurer’s daughter sat talking with the slave-woman Kāḷī. “Mother Kāḷī,” said she, “it was through me that your son obtained all this worldly glory.” “How is that, my lady?” “Why, this youth came to our house with his own death-warrant fastened to the hem of his garment. I tore up that letter and wrote another, ordering the celebration of a festival in honor of my marriage to him. In this way did I protect him all that time.” “My lady, this is all you know about it. But as a matter of fact, from the time your husband was a little boy, the treasurer constantly sought to kill him, and though his attempts were unsuccessful, a large sum of money was spent solely for the purpose of accomplishing his death.” “Kāḷī, the treasurer was indeed guilty of abominable crimes!”*";
P_HTM[739]="***Having performed his ceremonial circuit of the city, Ghosaka entered his house. Now when his wife saw him, she thought to herself, “It was through me that he obtained all this worldly glory,” and laughed. The treasurer’s son asked her, “Why do you laugh?” “For a certain reason.” “Tell me the reason.” She refused to do so. He drew his sword and said, “If you do not tell me, I will cut you in twain.” Then she said, “I laughed to think that it was through me that you obtained all this worldly glory.” “If what I possess was handed over to me by my father, where do you come in?” (We are told that during all that time Ghosaka knew nothing about the designs against his life, and that that was why he refused to believe what she said.) So she told him the whole story, saying, “When your father sent you forth bearing your own death-warrant, I did this and that and protected you.”*";
P_HTM[740]="***“What you say is not true,” replied Ghosaka, refusing to believe her. “I will ask Mother Kāḷī.” So he asked the slave-woman, “Kāḷī, is what she says true?” “Yes, my lord. From the time you were a little boy your father sought constantly to kill you, and though his attempts were unsuccessful, a large sum of money was spent for the purpose of accomplishing your death. On seven occasions you had a narrow escape from death. Now, coming from the village of which he was headman, you have obtained the post of treasurer, together with all the hundred villages.”*";
P_HTM[741]="***When Ghosaka heard this, he thought to himself, “How great was my presumption! But since I have escaped from so terrible a death, I must no longer live the life of Heedlessness. Henceforth, therefore, I will live the life of Heedfulness.” Accordingly he established alms for the blind and the poor, and employing his friend the householder as steward of his alms, he dispensed a thousand pieces of money daily.*";
P_HTM[742]="***Part 3. Birth and youthful career of Sāmāvatī*";
P_HTM[743]="***Now at this time there lived in the city of Bhaddavatī a treasurer named Bhaddavatiya, and he was a friend of the treasurer Ghosaka, although Ghosaka had never seen him. For the treasurer Ghosaka heard, from traders who came from the city of Bhaddavatī, of the wealth and age of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, and desiring to be friends with him, sent him a present. Likewise the treasurer Bhaddavatiya heard, from traders who came from the city of Kosambi, of the wealth and age of the treasurer Ghosaka, and desiring to be friends with him, sent him a present. Thus, although neither had seen the other, they dwelt as friends.*";
P_HTM[744]="***After a time intestinal disease broke out in the house of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya. When this disease breaks out, the first to die are flies; afterwards, in regular order, insects, mice, domestic fowls, swine, cattle, slaves both female and male, and last of all the members of the household. Only those that break down the wall and flee, save their lives. Now at that time the treasurer Bhaddavatiya and his wife and daughter fled in this manner, and intending to seek the treasurer Ghosaka, set out on the road to Kosambi. While they were still on their way, their provisions for the journey gave out, and their bodies became exhausted from exposure to wind and sun, and from hunger and thirst. Reaching Kosambi with difficulty, they bathed in a pool of water in a pleasant place and then entered a certain rest-house at the gate of the city.*";
P_HTM[745]="***Then the treasurer said to his wife, “Wife, those who travel in this way are not courteous even to a mother who has borne a child. Now I have a friend who, they say, dispenses a thousand pieces of money daily in alms to the blind, the poor, and other unfortunate persons. We will send our daughter there, have her bring us food, remain right here for a day or two and refresh our bodies, and then we will go and see my friend.” “Very well, husband,” she replied, and they took up their residence right there in the rest-house.*";
P_HTM[746]="***On the following day, when meal-time was announced and the blind, the poor, and other unfortunate persons went to obtain food, the mother and father sent forth their daughter, saying, “Daughter, go bring us food.” So the daughter of a wealthy house, pride overcome with misfortune, hid her shame, took a bowl, and went with poor folk to procure food. “How many portions will you have?” she was asked. “Three,” she replied. So they gave her three portions. She carried the food back to her parents, and the three sat down to eat together. The mother and daughter said to the treasurer, “Master, misfortune comes even to prominent families. Eat without regarding us and do not worry.” After a good deal of urging, they prevailed upon him to eat. But after he had eaten, he was unable to digest his food, and when the sun rose, he died. The mother and daughter wept and wailed and lamented.*";
P_HTM[747]="***On the following day the young girl went the second time to procure food. “How many portions will you have?” “Two.” She carried the food back to her mother, and after a good deal of urging, prevailed upon her to eat. The mother yielded to her pleading and consented to eat, but died on that very day. The young girl, left alone to herself, wept and wailed and lamented over the misfortune that had come upon her. On the following day, suffering the pangs of hunger keenly, she went weeping in the company of beggars to procure food. “How many portions will you have, daughter?” “One,” was her reply.*";
P_HTM[748]="***A householder named Mitta, remembering that she had received food for three days, said to her, “Perish, vile woman. To-day, at last, you have come to know the capacity of your belly.” This daughter of a respectable family, modest and timid, felt as though she had received a sword-thrust in her bosom, or as though salt water had been sprinkled on a sore. She immediately replied, “What do you mean, sir?” “Day before yesterday you took three portions, yesterday two, to-day you take but one. To-day, then, you know the capacity of your belly.” “Sir, do not think that I took these for myself.” “Why then did you take them?” “Sir, day before yesterday we were three, yesterday we were two, to-day I am left alone.” “How is that?” he inquired.*";
P_HTM[749]="***She then told him the whole story from the beginning. As he listened to her story, he was unable to control his tears, but was overcome by the power of the grief that arose within him. Finally he said to her, “My dear girl, if this is the case, do not worry. Hitherto you have been the daughter of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, but from this day forth you shall be my very own daughter.” And he kissed her on the head, conducted her to his own house, and adopted her as his own oldest daughter.*";
P_HTM[750]="***One day she heard loud and piercing screams in the refectory, whereupon she said to her foster-father, “Father, why do you not keep these people quiet when you dispense alms?” “It is impossible to do it, dear daughter.” “Father, it is quite possible.” “How would you do it, dear daughter?” “Father, put a fence around the refectory and hang two gates through which the people may pass in and out, allowing only sufficient space for one person to pass through at a time. Then direct the people to pass in through one gate and out through the other. If you do this, they will receive their alms peaceably and quietly.” When the householder had heard her plan he remarked, “A happy device, dear daughter,” and did as she suggested. Now up to that time her name had been Sāmā, but through her construction of a fence (vati) she received the name Sāmāvatī. From that time on there was no more tumult in the refectory.*";
P_HTM[751]="***Now the treasurer Ghosaka had long been accustomed to hear this noise in the refectory and rather liked to hear it; for it always made him think, “That is the noise in my refectory.” But after hearing no noise at all for two or three days, he asked the householder Mitta, who came one day to wait upon him, “Are alms being given to the blind, the poor, and other unfortunate persons?” “Yes, sir.” “How then does it happen that for two or three days past I have not heard a sound?” “I have arranged matters so that the people now receive alms without making any noise.” “Why didn’t you do so before?” “I didn’t know how, sir.” “How did you happen to find a way just now?” “My daughter told me how to do it, sir.” “Have you a daughter whom I have never seen?” Then the householder told him the whole story of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, beginning with the outbreak of the plague and ending with his adoption of the young girl as his own oldest daughter.*";
P_HTM[752]="***Then said the treasurer to him, “If this is the case, why did you not tell me? My friend’s daughter is my own daughter.” So he sent for her and asked her, “Dear girl, are you the daughter of the treasurer?” “Yes, sir, I am.” “Well then, do not worry; you are my own daughter.” Then he kissed her on the head, gave her five hundred women for her retinue, and adopted her as his own oldest daughter.*";
P_HTM[753]="***One day a festival was proclaimed in this city. Now at this festival daughters of respectable families, who do not ordinarily go out, go on foot with their own retinue and bathe in the river. Accordingly on that day Sāmāvatī also, accompanied by her five hundred women, went right through the palace court to bathe in the river. King Udena stood at his window and saw her. “Whose are those nautch-girls?” he inquired. “Nobody’s nautch-girls, your majesty.” “Then whose daughters are they?” “Your majesty, that is the daughter of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, and her name is Sāmāvatī.” Now the king fell in love with the girl the moment he saw her, and immediately sent word to the treasurer Ghosaka, “Send me the maiden they say is your daughter.” “I will not send her, your majesty.” “Do not act thus. Do as I ask and send her.” “Your majesty, we householders do not give young girls, for fear people will say they are abused and maltreated.” Angered by the treasurer’s reply, the king caused the treasurer’s house to be sealed and the treasurer and his wife to be seized and turned out of doors.*";
P_HTM[754]="***When Sāmāvatī returned after her bath and found no way of entering the house, she asked, “What does this mean, dear father?” “Dear daughter, the king sent for you; and when we refused to give you to him, he caused the house to be sealed and caused us to be turned out of doors.” “Dear father, you made a great mistake. When one who is a king commands, you should not say, ‘We do not give.’ You should rather say, ‘If you will take our daughter with her retinue, we will give her to you.’ ” “Very well, dear daughter. If that is your desire, I will do as you say.” Accordingly Ghosaka sent a message to that effect to the king, and the king accepted his offer, saying, “Very well.” Then the king conducted Sāmāvatī with her retinue to the royal palace, conferred the ceremonial sprinkling on her, and elevated her to the dignity of chief consort. The other women became her ladies-in-waiting.*";
P_HTM[755]="***Part 4. Winning of Vāsuladattā by Udena*";
P_HTM[756]="***Yet another of Udena’s queen-consorts was Vāsuladattā, daughter of Caṇḍa Pajjota, king of Ujjeni. One day, as Caṇḍa Pajjota was returning from his pleasure-garden, he surveyed his own splendor and asked, “Is there any other soever possessed of splendor like mine?” “Splendor such as it is, King Udena of Kosambi possesses exceeding great splendor.” “Very well, let us take him captive.” “It is impossible to capture him.” “By employing some means or other, let us capture him all the same.” “It is impossible, your majesty.” “Why?” “He understands the art of charming elephants. By reciting spells and playing his elephant-charming lute, he either drives elephants away or captures them at his pleasure. No one possesses so many riding-elephants as he.” “I suppose it is impossible for me to capture him.” “If you are bent on doing it, have a wooden elephant made and turned loose near him. Let him hear of a good mount, be it elephant or horse, and he will go a long way for it. When he is close by, you can capture him.” “A stratagem indeed!” exclaimed the king.*";
P_HTM[757]="***So the king had a mechanical elephant made of wood, wrapped about with strips of cloth and deftly painted, and turned it loose on the bank of a certain lake near the country of his enemy. Within the belly of the elephant sixty men walked back and forth; every now and then they loaded their shovels with elephant dung and dumped it out. A certain woodman saw the elephant, and thinking to himself, “Just the thing for our king!” went and told the king, “Your majesty, I saw a noble elephant, pure white even as the peak of Kelasa, just the sort of elephant your majesty would like.”*";
P_HTM[758]="***Udena mounted his elephant and set out, taking the woodman along as a guide and accompanied by his retinue. His approach was observed by spies, who went and informed Caṇḍa Pajjota. The latter straightway dispatched armies on both flanks of his enemy, allowing the space between them to remain open. Udena, unaware of his enemy’s approach, continued to pursue the elephant. He recited his spell and played his lute, but all to no purpose. The wooden elephant, driven with great speed by the men concealed within its belly, made as if it failed to hear the charm and continued its flight. The king, unable to overtake the elephant, mounted his horse. On and on sped the horse, galloping so rapidly that by degrees the army of the king was left far behind and the king was quite alone. Then Caṇḍa Pajjota’s men, who were posted on both flanks, captured Udena and turned him over to their king. Udena’s army, perceiving that their leader had fallen into the hands of the enemy, built a stockade just outside of Ujjeni and remained there.*";
P_HTM[759]="***Caṇḍa Pajjota, having thus captured Udena alive, clapped him into prison behind closed doors and kept wassail for three days. On the third day Udena asked his keepers, “Friends, where’s your king?” “Carousing, for, says he, ‘I’ve landed my enemy.’ ” “What does your king mean by acting like a woman? He has captured a royal adversary and surely ought either to release him or to kill him. He has brought humiliation upon us and is ‘carousing’– indeed!” The keepers went and reported the incident to the king. The king came and asked, “Is it true that you said thus and thus?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Very well, I will release you. They say you have such and such a charm; will you give it to me?” “Certainly I will give it to you; but when you receive it, will you pay me homage?” “I pay you homage? I’ll not pay you homage.” “Then I’ll not give it to you.” “In that case I will have you executed.” “Do so; you are lord of my body, not of my mind.”*";
P_HTM[760]="***When the king heard Udena’s defiant answer, he thought to himself, “How in the world can I get the charm? I have it. I’ll have my daughter learn it from him, and then I’ll learn it from her. It would never do to let anyone else learn a charm like this.” So he said to Udena, “Will you divulge the charm to another, if the other will pay you homage?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Well then, we have in our house a hunchbacked woman. She will sit behind a curtain; you remain outside and have her repeat the charm.” “Be she hunchback or cripple, I will teach her the charm, provided she will pay me homage.”*";
P_HTM[761]="***Then the king went to his daughter Vāsuladattā and said, “Dear daughter, there is a certain leper who knows a priceless charm. You sit behind a curtain, and he will remain outside and repeat it to you. You get it from him, for it would never do to let anyone else learn it, and then I will get it from you.” After this sort, for fear of their making love, did Caṇḍa Pajjota feign that his daughter was a hunchback and Udena a leper. So Vāsuladattā seated herself behind a curtain, and Udena remained outside and caused her to repeat the charm.*";
P_HTM[762]="***One day Udena repeated the words of the charm over and over again to Vāsuladattā, but the latter was unable to reproduce it correctly. Thereupon Udena cried out, “Dunce of a hunchback, your lips are too thick and your cheeks too pudgy! I’ve a mind to beat your face in! Say it this way!” Vāsuladattā replied in anger, “Villain of a leper, what do you mean by those words? Do you call such as I hunchback’?” Udena lifted the fringe of the curtain and asked, “Who are you?” Said the maiden, “I am Vāsuladattā, daughter of the king.” “When your father spoke to me, he described you as a hunchback.” “When he spoke to me, he made you out a leper.” Both said, “He must have said it for fear of our making love.” Then and there within the curtain they made love, and from that time on there was no learning charms or getting lessons. The king regularly asked his daughter, “Daughter, are you learning your lessons?” “Yes, father.”*";
P_HTM[763]="***Now one day Udena said to Vāsuladattā, “My dear, a husband can do that which neither father nor mother nor brothers nor sisters can do. If you will save my life, I will give you a retinue of five hundred women and make you my chief consort.” “If you will carry out your promise without fail, I will save your life.” “My dear, I will do so without fail.” “Very well, husband.” So she went to her father, saluted him, and stood respectfully on one side. Her father asked her, “Daughter, is your task completed?” “Not quite completed, father.” “What do you require, daughter?” “We must have at our disposal a door and a mount, father.” “Why this request?” “Father, this is what my teacher says: ‘In order to work the charm, a certain medicinal herb is necessary, and this must be obtained at night at a time indicated by the stars.’ Therefore whenever we are obliged to go out, whether it be early or late, we must have a door and a mount at our disposal.” “Very well,” said the king, giving his consent. They secured permission to use a certain door at any time they pleased.*";
P_HTM[764]="***Now the king was possessed of the five conveyances: a female elephant named Bhaddavatī, which could travel fifty leagues a day; a slave named Kāka, who could travel sixty leagues a day; two mares, Celakaṇṭhī and Muñjakesī, which could travel a hundred leagues a day; and an elephant named Nālāgiri, which could travel a hundred and twenty leagues a day.*";
P_HTM[765]="***Story of the Past: Caṇḍa Pajjota wins the five conveyances*";
P_HTM[766]="***It seems that before the appearance in the world of the present Buddha, the king had been the servitor of a certain ruler. Now one day as this ruler was returning from his bath outside of the city, a certain Private Buddha who had entered the city to receive alms came out with his bowl clean as it had been washed, having received not a single morsel of food by reason of the evil influence of Māra over all the residents of the city. Indeed when the Private Buddha reached the gate of the city, Māra approached him in disguise and asked him, “Reverend Sir, did you receive anything?” “But have you made it possible for me to receive anything?” “Well then, turn back and go in again. Now I will make it possible for you to receive alms.” “I will not go back again.” Had the Private Buddha returned, Māra would once more have taken possession of the bodies of all the residents of the city and would have subjected him to the embarrassment of hand-clapping and rude laughter.*";
P_HTM[767]="***Now when this ruler saw the Private Buddha returning with his bowl clean as it had been washed, he asked him, “Reverend Sir, did you receive anything?” “I have gone my round and am coming out, brother.” The ruler thought to himself, “His reverence does not answer the question I asked him, but tells me something I did not ask about. It must be that he failed to receive anything.” The ruler looked at his bowl and saw that it was empty. Not knowing whether the food in his house was ready or not, and therefore, brave though he was, not daring to take his bowl, he said, “Wait a moment, Reverend Sir.” So saying, he went home quickly and asked, “Is our food ready?” Receiving the answer that it was ready, he said to his servitor, “Friend, there is no one possessed of greater speed than you. Make the greatest possible speed, and when you reach his reverence, say to him, ‘Reverend Sir, give me your bowl,’ and then take his bowl and return to me.”*";
P_HTM[768]="***At the mere word of his master the servitor set out, obtained the bowl, and brought it back. The ruler filled the bowl with his own food and said, “Convey this to his reverence with all speed. I make over to you the merit of this action.” The servitor went quickly, gave the bowl to the Private Buddha, saluted him with the Five Rests, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, the time is short. I went and returned with the greatest possible speed. As the fruit of this speed, may I obtain the five conveyances able to travel fifty, sixty, a hundred, and a hundred and twenty leagues a day respectively. As I returned and went, my body was heated by the rays of the sun. As the fruit of this, in the various places where I shall be reborn, may I possess authority equal to the power of the rays of the sun. My master has made over to me the merit of this alms. In consequence of this may I be a partaker of the Truth you have seen.” The Private Buddha said, “So be it,” and returned thanks in the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[769]="***May all you’ve wished and prayed for come out well;*";
P_HTM[770]="***May all your aspirations be fulfilled, even as the moon at the full.*";
P_HTM[771]="***May all you’ve wished and prayed for come out well;*";
P_HTM[772]="***May all your aspirations be fulfilled, as by the jewel Dew of Light.*";
P_HTM[773]="***This was the king’s deed in a previous state of existence. He was now Caṇḍa Pajjota, and in consequence of this deed he came to possess these five conveyances. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[774]="***Now one day the king went out to amuse himself in the garden. “Now’s the time to flee,” thought Udena. So he filled several big leather sacks with gold and silver coins, placed the sacks on the back of the female elephant, assisted Vāsuladattā to mount, and away they went. The harem guards saw what was happening and went and told the king. The king sent out a force in pursuit. “Go quickly,” said he. When Udena perceived that a force had set out in pursuit, he opened a sack of gold and scattered the coins along the way. His pursuers stopped to pick up the coins and then hurried along. Then he opened a sack of silver and scattered the coins along the way. While his pursuers delayed because of their greed for silver, Udena reached his own stockade built without the city. When his men saw him coming, they surrounded him, and escorted him back to Kosambi. When he arrived there, he sprinkled Vāsuladattā and raised her to the rank of chief consort.*";
P_HTM[775]="***Part 5. Rejection of Māgandiyā by the Buddha*";
P_HTM[776]="***Still another maiden who gained the dignity of chief consort of the king was Māgandiyā. She, we are told, was the daughter of the Brahman Māgandiya, who lived in the Kuru country, her mother also bore the name Māgandiyā and her father’s younger brother likewise bore the name Māgandiya. She was as beautiful as a celestial nymph. Now her father was unable to find a husband who was worthy of her; and although scions of all the great families in the country asked for her hand, her father sent them all away, reviling them and saying, “You are not worthy of my daughter.”*";
P_HTM[777]="***Now one day, as the Teacher surveyed the world at early dawn, he perceived that the Brahman Māgandiya and his wife possessed the dispositions requisite for the attainment of the Fruit of the Third Path. Therefore, taking his own bowl and robe, he went to a place just outside of a certain market-town, where the Brahman was tending the sacred fire. The Brahman surveyed the person of the Tathāgata, beholding in him the perfection of physical beauty, and thought to himself, “There is no other man in the whole world comparable to this man. I will give my daughter to this man to cherish and support.” Accordingly he said to the Teacher, “Monk, I have a single daughter, and all this time I have not seen a man worthy of her. But you are suitable for her, and she is suitable for you. For you ought to have a wife, and she ought to have a husband. I will give her to you. Wait right here until I come back.” The Teacher said not a word, but remained silent.*";
P_HTM[778]="***The Brahman went home quickly and said to his wife, “Wife! wife! I saw a man who is worthy of our daughter. Hurry! hurry! Dress her in her beautiful garments.” So the Brahman had his daughter dressed in her beautiful garments, and taking daughter and wife with him, went to the Teacher. The whole city was agitated. “All this time,” said the people, “this man has said of every suitor, ‘He is not suitable for my daughter,’ and has refused to give her to anyone. But it is reported that he has said, ‘To-day I saw a man who is suitable for my daughter.’ What manner of man can he be? Let us go see him.” So a great throng of people went out of the city with him.*";
P_HTM[779]="***Now when the Brahman set out with his daughter, the Teacher, instead of remaining in the place mentioned by the Brahman, moved away from that place and took his stand in another place, leaving a footprint. (When the Buddhas establish a footprint, it appears only in a trodden place and not elsewhere, and only those for whom it is established can see it. Let elephants or other wild animals tread upon a footprint of the Buddhas to render it invisible, or let a violent storm pour forth rain upon it, or let the roaring winds beat upon it, yet not one of them can obliterate it.)*";
P_HTM[780]="***Now the Brahman’s wife said to the Brahman, “Where is this man?” The Brahman replied, “I said to him, ‘Remain in this place.’ Where can he possibly have gone?” He looked all about, and seeing his footprint, said, “Here is his footprint.” Now the Brahman’s wife was familiar with the three Vedas, including the verses relating to signs. So she repeated the verses relating to signs, considering carefully the signs borne by the footprint before her. Finally she said, “Brahman, this is no footprint of one who follows the Five Lusts.” So saying, she pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[781]="***The footprint of a lustful man will be squatty;*";
P_HTM[782]="***That of a wicked man, violently pressed down;*";
P_HTM[783]="***Of one infatuate, the footprint will be shuffling;*";
P_HTM[784]="***This is the sort of footprint made by one who has rolled back the Veil of Passion.*";
P_HTM[785]="***Then said the Brahman to her, “Wife, you are always seeing crocodiles in the water-vessel and thieves hiding in the house. Be still.” “Brahman, you may say what you like, but this is no footprint of one who follows the Five Lusts.”*";
P_HTM[786]="***Just then the Brahman looked around and saw the Teacher. “There is the man!” said he. Thereupon the Brahman went to him and said, “Monk, I give you my daughter to cherish and support.” The Teacher, instead of saying, “I have need of your daughter,” or “I have no need of your daughter,” said to him, “Brahman, I have something to say to you.” “Say it, monk,” replied the Brahman. Thereupon the Teacher told him how Māra had pursued him from the time of the Great Retirement to the time of the Session under the Goatherd’s Banyan-tree, and how, when Māra seated himself under the Goatherd’s Banyan-tree, overcome with sorrow at the thought, “Now this man has escaped from my power,” Māra’s daughters came to assuage their father’s sorrow and endeavored to seduce him by appearing before him in the forms of women both young and old. “At that time,” said the Teacher,*";
P_HTM[787]="***Having seen Craving, Pining, and Lust,*";
P_HTM[788]="***I had no desire for the pleasures of love.*";
P_HTM[789]="***What is this body, filled with urine and dung?*";
P_HTM[790]="***I should not be willing to touch it, even with my foot.*";
P_HTM[791]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza the Brahman and his wife were established in the Fruit of the Third Path.*";
P_HTM[792]="***As for Māgandiyā, she said to herself, “If this man has no need of me, it is perfectly proper for him to say so, but he declares me to be full of urine and dung. Very well! By virtue of the fact that I possess birth, lineage, social position, wealth, and the charm of youth, I shall obtain a husband who is my equal, and then I shall know what ought to be done to the monk Gotama.” And then and there she conceived hatred towards the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[793]="***(Did the Teacher know, or did he not know, that she had conceived hatred towards him? He knew. If he knew, why did he pronounce the Stanza? For the sake of the other two. For the Buddhas take no account of hatred directed against them, but preach the Law solely for the sake of those who are worthy to attain the Paths and the Fruits.)*";
P_HTM[794]="***Her mother and father took her and committed her to the charge of her uncle Culla Māgandiya, and then retired from the world and attained Arahatship. Culla Māgandiya thought to himself, “My daughter is not suited to be the wife of a low person, but is suited to be the consort of a king.” Accordingly he adorned her with all the adornments, took her with him to Kosambi, and presented her to King Udena, saying, “This jewel of a woman is worthy to become a consort of your majesty.” When the king saw her, he fell deeply in love with her, conferred the ceremonial sprinkling upon her, provided her with a retinue of five hundred ladies-in-waiting, and raised her to the dignity of chief consort.*";
P_HTM[795]="***Thus the king had three chief consorts with a retinue of fifteen hundred nautch-girls.*";
P_HTM[796]="***Part 6. Death of Sāmāvatī and of Māgandiyā, and the explanation thereof*";
P_HTM[797]="***Treasurers, monks, and tree-spirit*";
P_HTM[798]="***Now at this time there were living in Kosambi three treasurers, Ghosaka, Kukkuṭa, and Pāvāriya. As the beginning of the rainy season drew near, these men saw five hundred ascetics who had returned from the Himālaya country going the round of the city for alms. With joyful hearts they provided them with seats, offered them food, and obtaining from them a promise to reside with them, they provided them with lodging in their own homes during the four months of the rains. Then, having obtained from them a promise to return and spend the following rainy season with them, they let them go. From that time forth, after the ascetics had resided for eight months in the Himālaya country, they kept residence during the four months of the rains with the three treasurers.*";
P_HTM[799]="***On a later occasion, as the ascetics were on their way back from the Himālaya country, they saw a certain great banyan-tree in a forest retreat and went and sat down at the foot of it. The oldest ascetic thought to himself, “The deity who resides in this tree cannot be mundane. There must be a deva-king of great power here. How good it would be if he would give this band of ascetics water to drink!” Immediately the tree-spirit gave them water to drink. Then the ascetic thought of water to bathe in, and the spirit gave that also. Then he thought of food, and the spirit gave that also.*";
P_HTM[800]="***Then this thought occurred to the ascetic, “This deva-king gives us every single thing we think of. I wish we might see him.” Immediately the spirit burst the trunk of the tree and showed himself. Thereupon they asked him, “Deva-king, you possess great power. What did you do to get it?” “Do not ask me, Reverend Sirs.” “Deva-king, please tell us.” But the spirit was exceedingly modest, for the reason that the work of merit he had performed was a very small one, and therefore he did not wish to tell. However, after a good deal of urging, he said, “Well then, listen,” and told the following*";
P_HTM[801]="***Story of the Past: Tree-spirit’s former deed*";
P_HTM[802]="***The tree-spirit, it appears, was once a poor man who sought and obtained work for hire from Anāthapiṇḍika and through him made a living. Now one fast-day Anāthapiṇḍika asked on his return from the monastery, “Has anyone told this laborer that to-day is fast-day?” “He has not been told, master.” “Well then, cook him his supper.” So they cooked him a measure of rice. Now the laborer had worked all day in the forest, and when he returned in the evening, he said, “I am hungry.” But when the rice had been prepared and given to him, all of a sudden he refused to eat. “On other days,” he thought to himself, “there is a great uproar in this house, ‘Give me rice, give me sauce, give me curry;’ but to-day all have lain down without making a sound, and they have prepared food for me alone. What can this mean?”*";
P_HTM[803]="***So he asked them, “Have the rest eaten?” “They have not eaten.” “Why?” “In this house people eat no supper on fast-days; all keep the fast. The great treasurer requires all to fast, even infants at the breast, first causing them to rinse their mouths and to eat the four sweet foods. A lamp of scented oil is lighted, and all, both young and old, retire to recite the Thirty-two Constituents of the Body. But we did not think it worth while to tell you it was fast-day, and therefore rice was cooked for you alone. Eat it.” “If it is proper for me to begin the fast now, I should like to do so.” “This is a matter for the treasurer to decide.” “Well then, ask him.” They went and asked the treasurer, and he replied as follows, “If he begins the fast now and rinses his mouth and takes upon himself the fast-day precepts, he will earn half the merit of keeping fast-day.” When the laborer heard the answer, he began the fast.*";
P_HTM[804]="***Now the laborer had worked all day long and was hungry, and the result was that the humors of his body became disordered. He bound a girth about his body, and holding the end of the girth in his hand, he rolled over and over. When the treasurer learned of this, he took the four sweet foods and with torches borne before him went to the laborer and asked, “Friend, what is the matter?” “Master, the humors of my body are out of order.” “Well then, get up and eat this medicinal food.” “You eat it, master.” “I am not sick. You eat it.” “Master, as for keeping the fast, I was not able to keep it all, but let me not be deprived of half.” With these words the laborer refused to eat. “Do not act thus, friend,” said the treasurer. But the laborer steadfastly refused to eat, and when the sun rose, he died even as a garland of flowers withers, and was reborn in that banyan-tree.*";
P_HTM[805]="***Treasurers, monks, and tree-spirit, concluded.*";
P_HTM[806]="***Therefore the tree-spirit explained the matter as follows, “The treasurer was devoted to the Buddha, devoted to the Law, devoted to the Order; and it was through him, and in consequence of the merit I earned by keeping half of fast-day, that I obtained this power.” When the five hundred ascetics heard the name “Buddha,” they arose and stretched out their hands in an attitude of reverent supplication to the spirit and said, “Say ‘Buddha.’ ” Three times they caused the spirit to confess his faith by repeating the formula, “I say ‘Buddha.’ ” Then they breathed forth the solemn utterance, “This is an utterance difficult to obtain in this world,” and said in conclusion, “Spirit, you have permitted us to hear a sound we have not heard for many hundred thousand cycles of time.”*";
P_HTM[807]="***Then the pupils addressed their teacher as follows, “Well then, let us go to the Teacher.” “Friends, we have three treasurers who are generous benefactors of ours. To-morrow we will receive food in their residence, tell them also what we have heard, and go. Give your consent, friends.” Thereupon they gave their consent. On the following day the treasurers caused rice-porridge to be prepared and seats to be provided. And knowing that the ascetics would arrive on that day, they went forth and met them, escorted them to their residence, provided them with seats, and gave them food. When the ascetics had finished their meal, they said, “Great treasurers, we are going away.” “Reverend Sirs, did we not obtain from you a promise to reside with us during the four months of the rains? Where are you going now?”*";
P_HTM[808]="***“The Buddha has appeared in the world, the Law has appeared, the Order has appeared. We are therefore going to see the Teacher.” “But is it proper for you only to go to the Teacher?” “It is not forbidden to others also, friends.” “Well then, Reverend Sirs, you wait, and we also will go as soon as we have made preparations.” “If you wait to make preparations, we shall be delayed. Therefore we will go on ahead, and you may follow after.” So they went on ahead, and seeing the Supremely Enlightened One, praised him, paid obeisance to him, and sat down respectfully on one side. Then the Teacher preached the Law to them in orderly sequence, and at the conclusion of his discourse all of them attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. Thereupon they asked to be received into the Order. “Come, monks!” said the Teacher. As soon as he spoke the word, they became full-fledged monks, possessed of bowls and robes created by magic.*";
P_HTM[809]="***Those three treasurers procured the requisites for alms, consisting of garments, coverlets, ghee, honey, molasses, and so forth, and conveying five hundred cartloads apiece, proceeded to Sāvatthi. On reaching Sāvatthi, they paid obeisance to the Teacher, listened to a discourse on the Law, and at the conclusion of the discourse were established in the Fruit of Conversion. For a fortnight they resided with the Teacher, bestowing alms, and then invited the Teacher to come to Kosambi. As the Teacher gave his promise, he said, “The Tathāgatas delight in solitude.” Said the treasurers, “Reverend Sir, as soon as we notify you by sending you a message, it will be proper for you to come.” With these words they returned to Kosambi. The treasurer Ghosaka erected Ghosita monastery, the treasurer Kukkuṭa erected Kukkuṭa monastery, and the treasurer Pāvāriya erected Pāvāriya monastery.*";
P_HTM[810]="***When the treasurers had erected these three monasteries, they sent word to the Teacher to come and visit them. The Teacher, receiving their message, went there; whereupon they came forth to meet him, escorted him to the monasteries, and waited upon him by turns. The Teacher resided one day in each monastery and always went to receive alms at the door of the house of the particular treasurer in whose monastery he resided. Now these three treasurers had a servitor named Sumana, and he was a gardener. He said to the treasurers, “I have been a servitor of yours for a long time, and I should like to entertain the Teacher. Let me have the Teacher all to myself for just one day.” “Well then,” said they, “entertain him to-morrow.” “Very well, masters,” he replied, invited the Teacher, and made ready the usual honors.*";
P_HTM[811]="***Conversion of Sāmāvatī by Khujjuttarā*";
P_HTM[812]="***Now at that time King Udena was in the habit of giving Queen Sāmāvatī eight pieces of money every day to buy flowers with. A female slave of the queen named Khujjuttarā went regularly every day to the gardener Sumana and procured the flowers. When she came on that particular day, the gardener said to her, “I have invited the Teacher to be my guest and shall use my flowers to-day to honor the Teacher. You just wait, join with me in attendance on the Buddha, and listen to the Law. Then you may take with you the flowers that remain.” “Very well,” said she, consenting to remain. Sumana waited upon the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and took his bowl that he might pronounce the words of thanksgiving. The Teacher began to pronounce the words of thanksgiving. Khujjuttarā listened to the discourse on the Law and became established in the Fruit of Conversion.*";
P_HTM[813]="***On previous days she had been in the habit of appropriating to her own use four pieces of money and of buying flowers with the other four; but on that day, spending all eight to buy flowers with, she returned with them. Sāmāvatī said to her, “My good woman, did the king give us twice as much money to-day to buy flowers with?” “No, my lady.” “Then why so many flowers?” “On previous days I kept four pieces of money for myself and brought you only so many flowers as I could buy for four pieces of money.” “Why didn’t you take the money to-day?” “Because I heard the Supremely Enlightened discourse on the Law and acquired understanding of the Law.”*";
P_HTM[814]="***The queen did not revile her and say, “You wretched slave, give me back the pieces of money you have stolen during all this time.” Instead she said to her, “My good woman, you have drunk the Deathless. Give me thereof to drink also.” “Well then,” replied Khujjuttarā, “order that a bath be prepared for me.” So the queen had her bathed with sixteen bowls of scented water and presented her with garments of fine cloth. One of these garments she caused her to put on as an undergarment, the other she caused to be thrown over her shoulder; then she had a seat prepared for her. Khujjuttarā thereupon sat down, took in her hand a painted fan, and addressing the five hundred women, preached the Law to them just as the Teacher had preached it. Then all of them paid obeisance to Khujjuttarā and said, “Friend, from this day forth do no sinful deed, but be to us as a mother and a teacher. Go to the Teacher and listen to every discourse he preaches, and then come back and repeat it to us.” And this she did so faithfully that later on she came to know the Tipiṭaka by heart. Indeed the Teacher assigned her preeminence, saying, “Preeminent among my female lay disciples who are learned in the Scriptures and able to expound the Law is Khujjuttarā.”*";
P_HTM[815]="***Now those five hundred women said to her, “Woman, we should like to see the Teacher. Show him to us, that we may honor him with perfumes, garlands, and so forth.” “My lady, it is a serious matter to live in a king’s house. You have obtained access to it, but it is impossible for you to leave it.” “Woman, do not destroy us. Let us see the Teacher.” “Well then, make holes in the walls of your rooms large enough to look through. Then bring perfumes and garlands, and when the Teacher goes to the door of the house of the three treasurers, stand in your several places and look out and stretch forth your hands and pay obeisance to him and honor him.” They followed her directions, and when the Teacher went and returned, they looked out and paid obeisance to him and honored him.*";
P_HTM[816]="***Māgandiyā’s plot against Sāmāvatī and the Buddha*";
P_HTM[817]="***Now one day Māgandiyā came forth from her own mansion and walked along until she came to the place where those women lived. Seeing a hole in a room, she asked, “What is this?” The women, not knowing of the hatred she had conceived towards the Teacher, said, “The Teacher has come to this city, and we stand here and look at the Teacher and honor him.” “So the hermit Gotama has come to this city!” thought Māgandiyā. “Now I shall know what ought to be done to him. These women also are his supporters. I shall know what ought to be done to them also.” So she said to the king, “Great king, Sāmāvatī and her followers are disloyal to you and in but a few days will take your life.” The king replied, “They will do nothing of the sort,” and refused to believe the charge. Even when the charge was repeated, he still refused to believe. When she made the charge the third time and he still refused to believe, she said to him, “If you do not believe me, great king, go to the place where they reside and judge for yourself.” The king went there, and seeing the holes in the walls of the rooms, asked, “What does this mean?” When the matter was explained to him, he did not get angry, said not a word, but had the holes filled up and windows made with openings above in all the rooms. (Windows with openings above came in at this time, we are told.)*";
P_HTM[818]="***Unable to injure the women, Māgandiyā thought to herself, “At any rate I will do to the monk Gotama what ought to be done.” So she bribed the citizens and said to them, “When the monk Gotama comes into the city and walks about, instigate slaves to revile him and abuse him and drive him out of the city.” So heretics who did not believe in the Three Jewels followed the Teacher about when he entered the city and shouted at him, “You are a thief, a simpleton, a fool, a camel, an ox, an ass, a denizen of hell, a beast, you have no hope of salvation, a state of punishment is all that you can look forward to.” Thus they reviled and abused him with the Ten Terms of Abuse.*";
P_HTM[819]="***Venerable Ānanda heard this and said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, these citizens are reviling and abusing us. Let us go elsewhere.” “Where shall we go, Ānanda?” “To some other city, Reverend Sir.” “If men revile us there, where shall we go then, Ānanda?” “To yet another city, Reverend Sir.” “If men revile us there, where shall we go then?” “To still another city, Reverend Sir.” “Ānanda, one should not speak thus. Where a difficulty arises, right there should it be settled. Only under those circumstances is it permissible to go elsewhere. But who are reviling you, Ānanda?” “Reverend Sir, everyone is reviling us, slaves and all.” “Ānanda, I am like an elephant that has entered the fray. Even as it is the duty of an elephant that has entered the fray to withstand the arrows which come from the four quarters, precisely so it is my duty to endure with patience the words spoken by many wicked men.” So saying, he preached the Law with reference to himself by pronouncing the following three Stanzas in the Nāga Vagga,*";
P_HTM[820]="***320. Even as an elephant engaged in the fray withstands arrows shot from the bow.*";
P_HTM[821]="***So also must I bear abuse, for the multitude is wicked.*";
P_HTM[822]="***321. It is a tamed elephant they lead to battle; it is a tamed elephant the king mounts;*";
P_HTM[823]="***It is the tamed that is best among men, he that endures abuse patiently.*";
P_HTM[824]="***322. Of surpassing excellence are mules which are tamed, and well-bred Sindh horses,*";
P_HTM[825]="***And great elephants of the jungle; but better yet is the man who has tamed himself.*";
P_HTM[826]="***This discourse benefited the assembled multitude. When the Teacher had thus preached the Law, he said, “Ānanda, be not disturbed. These men will revile you for only seven days, and on the eighth day they will become silent. A difficulty encountered by the Buddhas lasts no longer than seven days.”*";
P_HTM[827]="***When Māgandiyā had failed in her attempt to drive the Teacher out of the city by abusing him, she thought to herself, “Pray what can I do now?” Then the thought occurred to her, “These women are his supporters. I will destroy them.” Accordingly one day, while King Udena was drinking strong drink and she was waiting upon him, she sent the following message to her uncle, “Let my uncle come with eight dead cocks and eight live cocks. Having arrived, let him stand at the top of the stairs and announce his arrival. When he hears the word ‘Enter,’ let him not enter, but send in first the eight live cocks and afterwards the others.” And she gave a bribe to the page, saying, “Be sure to carry out my orders.”*";
P_HTM[828]="***Māgandiya came and announced himself to the king. When, however, he heard the word “Enter,” he said, “I will not enter the king’s drinking-place.” Māgandiyā then sent her page, saying, “Boy, go to my uncle.” He went, took the eight live cocks which Māgandiyā gave him, carried them to the king, and said, “Your majesty, the house-priest has sent you a present.” “A most excellent and dainty morsel!” said the king. “Now who will cook them?” Māgandiyā said, “Great king, the five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī have nothing to do. Send the cocks to them. Let them cook them and carry them to you.” Accordingly the king sent them, saying to the page, “Go give these cocks to these women. Tell them not to intrust them to the hands of anyone else, but to kill them and cook them themselves.” “Very well, your majesty,” replied the page, and went and delivered the message. But the women refused to do the king’s bidding, saying, “We do not take the life of any living creature.” The page returned and so informed the king.*";
P_HTM[829]="***Māgandiyā said, “You see, great king? Now you shall find out whether or not they really take the life of living creatures. Your majesty, send word to them, ’ Cook them and send them to the monk Gotama.’ ” So the king sent this message to them. But the page, while pretending to carry the live cocks to the women, in reality went and gave those cocks to the house-priest and carried the eight dead cocks to the women, saying, “Cook these cocks and send them to the Teacher.” “This, to be sure, is our duty,” said the women in reply, and going to meet him, they received the cocks. When the page returned to the king and the latter asked him, “What was the result, boy?” he gave the king the following report, “The moment I said to them, “Cook these cocks and send them to the hermit Gotama,’ they came to meet me and accepted them.” “See, great king,” said Māgandiyā, “they will not do it for the like of you. But you would not believe me when I said to you, ‘Their inclination is towards another.’ ” But even when the king heard this, he tolerated their conduct and remained silent. Māgandiyā thought to herself, “What shall I do now?”*";
P_HTM[830]="***Now at this time the king was accustomed to divide his time equally among his three consorts, Sāmāvatī, Vāsuladattā, and Māgandiyā, spending seven days by turns in the apartment of each. Māgandiyā, knowing that he would go on the morrow or on the day after to the apartment of Sāmāvatī, sent word to her uncle, “Send me a snake, first washing its fangs with a poisonous drug.” He did as she told him to and sent her a snake. Now wherever the king went, he was accustomed to take with him his lute for charming elephants, and in the shell of this lute was a hole. Māgandiyā inserted the snake in the hole and stopped the hole with a bunch of flowers; for two or three days the snake remained within the lute.*";
P_HTM[831]="***On the day when the king was to go to Sāmāvatī’s apartment, Māgandiyā asked him, “To whose apartment will you go to-day, your majesty?” “To Sāmāvatī’s apartment.” Said Māgandiyā, “Your majesty, to-day I had a bad dream; you must not go there.” “I am going all the same.” Three times she tried to dissuade him from going and failed. Finally she said, “In that case I will go too.” In spite of the king’s protests she went with him, saying, “Your majesty, I do not know what will happen to you.”*";
P_HTM[832]="***The king, wearing garments, flowers, perfumes, and ornaments given him by Sāmāvatī and her followers, ate heartily, and then placed his lute by his pillow and lay down on the bed. Māgandiyā, pretending to be merely walking back and forth, removed the bunch of flowers from the opening in the lute; whereupon the snake, which had been without food for two or three days, glided from the opening, hissed, raised his hood, and coiled himself up on the top of the bed. When Māgandiyā saw the snake, she screamed with a loud voice, “Oh, your majesty, there is a snake!” And she straightway abused the king, saying, “This stupid, unlucky king will not listen to anything I say to him. As for these shameless scoundrels, what do they not receive from the king? You will live happily just as soon as the king is dead, but so long as he lives, you will have a hard time. Your majesty, when I cried out to you, ‘To-day I had a bad dream; you must not go to Sāmāvatī’s apartment’ you would not listen to what I said.”*";
P_HTM[833]="***When the king saw the snake, he was terrified with the fear of death, the fire of anger was kindled within him, and he said, “So this is the sort of thing they are capable of doing! What criminals they are! Yet I would not believe Māgandiyā when she told me of their evil nature. First they made holes in the walls of their own rooms and sat there; again, when I sent the cocks to them, they sent them back; to-day they have let a snake loose in my bed.”*";
P_HTM[834]="***Sāmāvatī delivered the following admonition to her five hundred women, “Friends, we have no other refuge. Cherish precisely the same feelings towards the king and the queen as you do towards yourselves. Be not angry with anyone.” The king took his horn-bow, which required a thousand men to string, twanged the bowstring, fitted a poisoned arrow to the string, and placing Sāmāvatī in front and all the other women in single file behind her, shot an arrow at Sāmāvatī’s breast. But through the supernatural power of her love the arrow turned back, and returning by the same path it had come, penetrated, as it were, the king’s heart.*";
P_HTM[835]="***The king thought to himself, “The arrow I shot is capable of piercing even a rock, and there was nothing in the air to make it turn back. But it turned and came back by the same path it went. Indeed this senseless, lifeless arrow knows her goodness, but I, who am a human being, know it not.” And throwing the bow away and stretching forth his hands in an attitude of reverent supplication, he knelt before Sāmāvatī’s feet and pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[836]="***I am utterly confused and bewildered; all four quarters are confused in my mind.*";
P_HTM[837]="***Protect me, Sāmāvatī, and be a refuge to me.*";
P_HTM[838]="***Sāmāvatī, hearing his words, instead of saying, “Very well, your majesty, seek refuge in me,” said, “Great king, in whom I have sought refuge, in him do you also seek refuge.”*";
P_HTM[839]="***Having thus spoken, Sāmāvatī, disciple of the Supremely Enlightened, said,*";
P_HTM[840]="***Do not seek refuge in me! He in whom I have sought refuge,–*";
P_HTM[841]="***He is the Buddha, great king, he is the Buddha Incomparable!*";
P_HTM[842]="***Seek refuge in that Buddha, and do you be a refuge to me.*";
P_HTM[843]="***The king said, “Now I am the more afraid,” and pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[844]="***Now I am the more confused; all four quarters are confused in my mind.*";
P_HTM[845]="***Protect me, Sāmāvatī, and be a refuge to me.*";
P_HTM[846]="***But she refused him precisely as before. Finally he said, “Well then, I seek refuge in you and in the Teacher, and I grant you a boon.” “I accept the boon, great king,” she replied.*";
P_HTM[847]="***The king approached the Teacher, sought refuge in him, invited him to accept his hospitality, and for seven days gave generous alms. Then, addressing Sāmāvatī, he said, “Rise and take your choice.” Sāmāvatī replied, “Great king, I have no need of gold and silver, but grant me this boon. Arrange matters so that the Teacher may come here regularly with his five hundred monks, so that I may hear the Law.” So the king paid obeisance to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, come here regularly with your five hundred monks. Sāmāvatī and her attendants say they wish to hear the Law.” The Teacher replied, “Great king, the Buddhas may not always go to one place; many desire their presence.” “Well then, direct one monk to come.” The Teacher directed Ānanda to go. So Ānanda went every day to the royal palace with five hundred monks, and those women every day provided the Elder with food and listened to the Law.*";
P_HTM[848]="***One day, after they had listened to the Elder’s discourse on the Law, their hearts were filled with joy, and they rendered honor to the Elder by presenting him with five hundred yellow robes such as are worn over the shoulders, each worth five hundred pieces of money. When the king saw that they had not a single garment left, he asked them, “Where are your yellow robes?” “We gave them to the Reverend Elder.” “Did he take them all?” “Yes, he took them all.” The king approached the Elder, paid obeisance to him, questioned him about the gift of the robes by the women, and learning that the women had given the robes and that the Elder had received them, asked, “Reverend Sir, there were a great many robes, were there not? What will you do with so many?” “I shall keep as many as we require for ourselves and send the rest to those whose robes are worn out, great king.” “What will they do with their own worn-out robes?” “They will give them to those whose robes are in a still worse state of repair.” “What will they do with their own worn-out robes?” “They will make bedspreads of them.” “What will they do with the old bedspreads?” “They will make carpets of them.” “What will they do with the old carpets?” “They will make foot-towels of them.” “What will they do with the old foot-towels?” “They will cut them into small pieces, mix them with mortar, and use them to plaster walls with.”*";
P_HTM[849]="***“Reverend Sir, although all these are given to your reverences, nothing is lost.” “Quite so, great king.” The king was so pleased that he caused five hundred more robes to be brought and placed at the Elder’s feet.*";
P_HTM[850]="***(We are told that robes worth five hundred pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand, and that he received this number a hundred thousand times; that robes worth a thousand pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand, and that he received this number a thousand times; that robes worth a hundred thousand pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand, and that he received this number a hundred times. It is impossible to enumerate the number of robes he received by ones and twos and threes and fours and fives and tens. We are told that, upon the death of the Teacher, the Elder traveled all over the Land of the Rose-apple, presenting to the monks in all of the monasteries bowls and robes of his own.)*";
P_HTM[851]="***Burning of Sāmāvatī and punishment of Māgandiyā*";
P_HTM[852]="***Māgandiyā thought to herself, “Whatever I do turns out otherwise than I expect. What shall I do now?” Finally she decided on a plan. On her way to the garden to amuse herself, she sent the following message to her uncle, “Go to Sāmāvatī’s palace, open the linen-closets and the oil-closets, soak pieces of cloth in the jars of oil, and wrap these cloths about the pillars. Then assemble all the women within the house, close the door, bar it from without, set fire to the house with torches, and then descend and go your way.”*";
P_HTM[853]="***Māgandiya went up into the palace, opened the closets, soaked garments in the oil-jars, and was just beginning to wrap them about the pillars when the women led by Sāmāvatī came up to him and said, “Why are you doing this, uncle?” “My ladies, the king desires these pillars to be strengthened, and has therefore given orders that they be wrapped in cloths soaked in oil. It is hard to understand why certain things should be done in a king’s house and certain other things should not be done. I beg of you, my ladies, not to remain here with me.” As soon as they had departed and entered their rooms at his suggestion, he closed the doors, barred them from without, set fire to first one cloth and then another, and descended.*";
P_HTM[854]="***Sāmāvatī delivered the following admonition to her followers, “It would not be an easy matter, even with the knowledge of a Buddha, to determine exactly the number of times our bodies have thus been burned with fire as we have passed from birth to rebirth in the round of existences which has no conceivable beginning. Therefore be heedful.” As the fire consumed the house, the women applied themselves to meditation on the element of pain, with the result that some of them attained the Fruit of the Second Path, while others attained the Fruit of the Third Path. Therefore it is said,*";
P_HTM[855]="***Now a large number of monks, returning from their alms-pilgrimage after breakfast, drew near to where the Exalted One was, and having drawn near, paid obeisance to the Exalted One and sat down reverently on one side. And as they sat there on one side, those monks said this to the Exalted One, “Here, Reverend Sir, while King Udena was in his pleasure-garden, the quarters of his women were consumed with fire, and five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī lost their lives. Reverend Sir, what will be the end, what will be the future state of these female lay disciples?”*";
P_HTM[856]="***“Monks, some of these female lay disciples obtained the Fruit of Conversion, others obtained the Fruit of the Second Path, others obtained the Fruit of the Third Path. Monks, none of those female lay disciples failed to receive the fruit of their past deeds.” And the Exalted One, clearly understanding the matter, breathed forth at that time the following Solemn Utterance,*";
P_HTM[857]="***Bound with the bond of delusion, the world appears to be good.*";
P_HTM[858]="***The simpleton, fettered by the conditions of being, enshrouded by darkness,*";
P_HTM[859]="***Thinks it eternal. But to him who really sees, there is naught.*";
P_HTM[860]="***So saying, he preached the Law, saying, “Monks, as living beings pass through the round of existences, they are not always heedful, and sometimes they commit sin. Therefore as they pass through the round of existences, they experience both pleasure and pain.”*";
P_HTM[861]="***When the king heard the cry, “Sāmāvatī’s house is on fire!” he went there quickly, but the house was burned before he could reach it. “Having extinguished the flames, he sat down surrounded by his retinue of courtiers, overwhelmed with profound grief, and recalled to his mind the virtues of Sāmāvatī. “Who could have done this deed?” thought he. Coming to the conclusion that Māgandiyā was the author of the crime, he thought to himself, “If I frighten her by my questions, she will not tell me. Therefore I will employ craft and question her gently.”*";
P_HTM[862]="***Accordingly he said to his ministers, “Well, until this moment, no matter what I was engaged in or occupied with, I was apprehensive and suspicious; Sāmāvatī was ever seeking occasion to slay me. But now my mind will rest in peace, and I shall be able to lie down to sleep in security.” “Who was it that did this deed, your majesty?” “Someone who really loved me must have done it.” Now Māgandiyā happened to be standing near, and when she heard the king say this, she said, “None other than I could have done this. I alone did it. I sent word to my uncle and ordered him to do it.” “Except you, there is not a living being who really loves me. I am delighted. I grant you a boon. Send for all of your relatives.”*";
P_HTM[863]="***So Māgandiyā sent the following message to her relatives, “The king is pleased with me and has granted me a boon. Come immediately.” The king rendered high honor to all those who came, insomuch that even persons who were in no way related to Māgandiyā, hearing about it, gave bribes and came and said, “We are relatives of Māgandiyā.” When the king had them all in his hands, he caused pits to be dug waist-deep in the palace-court, set them therein, filled up the pits with earth, spread straw on top, and set the straw on fire. When the skin had been burned to a crisp, he caused the bodies to be plowed with an iron plow and to be broken up into pieces and fragments. As for Māgandiyā, he had pieces of solid flesh ripped from various parts of her body with a sharp knife, and setting a vessel of oil on the brazier, he had them fried like cakes and made her eat them.*";
P_HTM[864]="***In the Hall of Truth the monks began to discuss matters, saying, “It is not right that a female lay disciple endowed with such faith should suffer such a death.” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, if you regard this existence alone, it is indeed highly improper and unjust that the five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī should suffer such a death. What they received, however, was in every way proper, considering the sin they committed in a previous existence.” “Reverend Sir, what was the sin they committed in a previous existence? Pray tell us.” Responding to their request, the Teacher related the following*";
P_HTM[865]="***Story of the Past: Sāmāvatī’s attempt to burn a Private Buddha*";
P_HTM[866]="***Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benāres, there were eight Private Buddhas who regularly took their meals in the royal palace, and there were five hundred women who waited upon them. Seven of these Private Buddhas retired to the Himālaya, and the Private Buddha who remained sat down on the bank of the river where there was a tangle of grass, and entered into mystic meditation.*";
P_HTM[867]="***Now one day, after the Private Buddhas had departed, the king took those women and went to sport in the water. When those women, who had sported there in the water all day, came out, they were stung with cold. Desiring to warm themselves, they said to each other, “Seek out some place where we can build a fire.” As they walked back and forth, they saw the tangle of grass, and thinking it was no more than a heap of grass, they gathered round it and set it on fire. When the grass burned down and they saw the Private Buddha, they cried out, “We are lost! we are lost! The king’s Private Buddha is burning up. If the king finds it out, he will kill everyone of us. Let us burn him well while we are about it.” So all those women brought firewood from all directions and piled it on the Private Buddha until they had erected a great pyre. Then they poured oil on it, and saying to themselves, “Now he will burn,” they departed.*";
P_HTM[868]="***Now in the beginning their act was a thoughtless one, and they were not bound thereby. But afterwards they committed a deliberate sin and were bound to suffer the consequences thereof. While the Private Buddha was absorbed in mystic meditation, they might have brought a hundred thousand cartloads of firewood and poured oil thereon, and they could not even have caused him to feel the heat. So on the seventh day the Private Buddha arose and went where he pleased. Because they committed this sin, those women were boiled for many hundreds of thousands of years in Hell, and because the fruit of that same evil deed was not yet exhausted, their houses were burned, and they were burned in their houses in a hundred successive states of existence in this very manner. This is the sin they committed in a previous state of existence.*";
P_HTM[869]="***When the Teacher had related this story, the monks asked him, “But, Reverend Sir, how did Khujjuttarā come to be a hunchback? How did she become so wise? How did she obtain the Fruit of Conversion? How did she become an errand-girl?”*";
P_HTM[870]="***Story of the Past: Khujjuttarā’s former deeds*";
P_HTM[871]="***Monks, while that same king was ruling in Benāres, there was a Private Buddha who was slightly hunchbacked. Now a certain serving-woman, throwing a blanket over her shoulder and taking a golden vessel in her hand, bent over so that she looked like a hunchback, and saying, “This is the way our Private Buddha walks,” imitated his manner of walking. It was in consequence of this that she came to be a hunchback.*";
P_HTM[872]="***But on the first day she provided those Private Buddhas with seats in the royal palace, took their bowls, filled them with rice-porridge, and presented them to them. The Private Buddhas took the bowls of porridge, but they were so hot that they were obliged to shift them from one hand to the other. That woman, seeing what they were doing, presented to them eight ivory bracelets of her own, saying, “Use these bracelets as stands for your bowls.” When they had so done, they looked at her, whereupon she said, “Reverend Sirs, we have no use for these bracelets. Accept them as a present from us before you go.” The Private Buddhas took them with them to Nandamūla mountain-cave, and those bracelets are preserved there unimpaired to this day. As the result of this act of hers, she now knows the Tipiṭaka by heart and possesses profound wisdom. Likewise it was through waiting upon the Private Buddhas that she obtained the Fruit of Conversion. These were her deeds in the interval between two Buddhas.*";
P_HTM[873]="***In the dispensation of Kassapa, the Supremely Enlightened, a certain treasurer’s daughter of Benāres took her mirror one day, as the shades of evening drew on, and sat down to adorn herself. Now a certain intimate friend of hers, a nun freed from the Depravities, came to see her. For nuns freed from the Depravities like to visit the households of their supporters at eventide. But at that moment the treasurer’s daughter happened to have no errand-girl with her. So she said to the nun, “I greet you, Reverend Lady. Just take that basket of ornaments and give it to me.” The nun thought to herself, “If I do not take this basket and give it to her, she will take a dislike to me and will be reborn in Hell; but if I do give it to her, she will be reborn as the errand-girl of another. However, it is better to be the errand-girl of another than to suffer torment in Hell.” So out of pity for her she took the basket and gave it to her. In consequence of this act she became the errand-girl of another. Stories of the Past concluded.*";
P_HTM[874]="***Again one day in the Hall of Truth the monks started a discussion. “Sāmāvatī and her five hundred women were burned with fire in their house; as for Māgandiyā and her kinswomen, a fire of straw was built over their bodies, and their bodies were torn asunder with iron plows, and Māgandiyā was boiled in boiling oil. Which of these are alive and which are dead?” The Teacher came in and asked, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said to them, “Monks, they that are heedless, though they live a hundred years, yet are they dead. They that are heedful, be they dead or alive, yet are they alive. Māgandiyā, while she yet lived, was dead already. Sāmāvatī and her followers, though they be dead, yet are they alive. For, monks, the heedful never die.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[875]="***21. Heedfulness is the Way to the Deathless; heedlessness is the way to death.*";
P_HTM[876]="***The heedful never die, but they that are heedless are, as it were, dead already.*";
P_HTM[877]="***22. Knowing this clearly, they that are advanced in heedfulness*";
P_HTM[878]="***Delight in heedfulness, and rejoice in the state of the Elect.*";
P_HTM[879]="***23. They that devote themselves to meditation, they that are persevering, they that put forth resolute effort.*";
P_HTM[880]="***They, the wise, attain Nibbāna, the highest bliss.*";
P_HTM[881]="*[16] 2. Kumbhaghosakaseṭṭhivatthu**2. The Voice Of A Rich Man*";
P_HTM[882]="***24. If a man exert himself, if he be ever mindful, if his deeds be pure, if he be circumspect of conduct,*";
P_HTM[883]="***If he control himself, if he live in accordance with the Law, if he be heedful, his glory ever increases.*";
P_HTM[884]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Kumbhaghosaka.*";
P_HTM[885]="***For once upon a time the plague broke out at Rājagaha in the house of the principal treasurer of Rājagaha. When the plague breaks out, animals, from flies to cattle, are the first to die; after them, slaves; after them, the master and mistress of a household. So this disease attacked last of all the treasurer and his wife. As soon as they felt the first touch of the disease, they looked at their son, who stood near, and with eyes filled with tears said to him, “Dear son, as we know, when this disease breaks out, only those who break down the wall and flee succeed in saving their lives. Therefore have no consideration for us, but make your escape. Having thus saved your life, come back again, and in such and such a place you will find buried in the earth forty crores of treasure. Dig up the treasure and live on the money.” When the son heard his parents speak thus, he wept aloud, bade farewell to his mother and father, and terrified with the fear of death, broke down the wall and fled. Seeking refuge in a certain mountain jungle, he dwelt there for twelve years, and then returned.*";
P_HTM[886]="***Now since he was a mere boy when he went away, and when he returned his hair and beard had grown long, no one recognized him. A sign which his mother and father had given him enabled him to find the place where the treasure had been buried, and going there he discovered that the treasure had not been disturbed. But he thought to himself, “No one knows me here, and if I dig up this treasure and begin to spend it, they will say, ‘A treasure has been dug up by a certain poor man,’ and will seize me and subject me to annoyance. Suppose I were to work for hire and thus gain a living.” So he dressed himself in rags and went through the servants’ quarters, inquiring, “Is there anyone who has need of a servant?”*";
P_HTM[887]="***When the servants saw him, they said, “If you will do a certain piece of work for us, we will pay you for it in rice.” “What kind of work is it, friends?’ ” “To order and direct our work. You will be obliged to get up early in the morning and go the rounds of the workers and give orders to them, saying, ‘Men, get up and bring out the carts and yoke the oxen; it is time for the elephants and horses to go to pasture. Women, you also get up and cook broth and rice.’ ” “Very well,” said the rich man, accepting the task. So they gave him a house to live in, and he did his work faithfully every day.*";
P_HTM[888]="***Now one day King Bimbisāra, who could recognize anyone by the sound of his voice, heard his voice and straightway said, “That is the voice of some rich man.” A certain female servant who stood near thought to herself, “No matter what the king says, this is something I ought to investigate.” Therefore she sent out a man, saying to him, “Just go and find out who this is.” The messenger straightway went and looked at the man, and on his return made the following report, “That is a poor man who is a servant of servants.” When the king heard his report, he said nothing; but on the second day and on the third day, hearing his voice, said precisely the same thing.*";
P_HTM[889]="***Every time the king made this remark the same thought occurred to that female servant, and again and again she sent a man to investigate. Every time she heard the report, “That is a poor man,” she thought to herself, “Every time the king hears the report, ‘That is a poor man,’ he refuses to believe it, and keeps repeating, ‘That is the voice of some rich man.’ There must be a reason for this, and it is my duty to find out the real facts.” Accordingly she said to the king, “Your majesty, give me a thousand pieces of money, and I will take my daughter and go to this man and bring this treasure to the royal palace.”*";
P_HTM[890]="***The king caused a thousand pieces of money to be given to her. She took the money, caused her daughter to put on a soiled dress, and departed with her from the royal palace. Pretending that she was making a journey, she went to the servants’ quarters, and entering a certain house, said to the mistress, “Woman, we are making a journey and should like to rest here for a day or two before we go on.” “Woman, there are many persons living in this house, and it is out of the question for you to remain here. But Kumbhaghosaka’s house is empty; go there.” So she went there and said to Kumbhaghosaka, “Master, we are making a journey and should like to remain here a day or two.” He refused her request, although she repeated it again and again. Finally she said, “Master, we will remain here to-day, just for one day, and early in the morning will continue our journey.” So saying, she refused to depart.*";
P_HTM[891]="***So she took up her residence there. On the following day, when it was time for Kumbhaghosaka to go to the forest, she said to him, “Master, give me an allowance for food before you go, and I will cook food for you.” “Never mind about that,” replied Kumbhaghosaka; “I will cook food all by myself and eat it.” After she had urged him repeatedly, he gave her the allowance. As soon as she received it, she procured from a shop cooking-vessels and the purest of rice. Preparing the finest of boiled rice in the manner of cooking practiced in the king’s household, and cooking with the greatest care three portions of sauce and curry, she presented the food to Kumbhaghosaka on his return from the forest.*";
P_HTM[892]="***When he had eaten his meal and his senses were dull, she said to him, “Master, we are tired and will remain here for a day or two.” “Very well,” said he, consenting to the arrangement. Likewise in the evening and on the following day she cooked savory food for him and gave it to him. When she perceived that his senses had become dull, she said to him, “Master, we will remain right here for a few days.”*";
P_HTM[893]="***Thus she contrived to establish a residence in his house. One day she took a sharp knife and cut the cords of his mattress underneath at the bed-frame in several places. The result was that, when he returned and lay down on his bed, the mattress sank down. Said he, “How did this bed come to be cut in this fashion?” “Master, I cannot prevent the boys from coming here and jumping on it.” “Woman, it is because of you that I have been subjected to this annoyance. Before you came, whenever I wished to go anywhere, I closed the door and went.” “My friend, what shall I do? I cannot stop them.” On three successive days she cut the mattress of his bed in this way, and when he became irritated and angry and rebuked her, she made the same answer.*";
P_HTM[894]="***Finally she cut all of the cords except one or two. On that day, as soon as he lay down on the bed, the entire mattress fell to the ground, and he was doubled up with his head between his knees. Rising to his feet, he said, “What shall I do? Where shall I go now? I have no longer a bed on which I can lie.” “Dear friend, what can I do? I cannot prevent the boys of the neighborhood from entering. Well, do not worry. Let me think where you might go at this time.” And addressing her daughter, she said to her, “My dear daughter, make room for your brother to lie down.” So her daughter lay down on one side of her bed and said to Kumbhaghosaka, “Master, come lie here.” The mother also said to him, “Dear friend, go lie with your sister.” Accordingly Kumbhaghosaka lay down on the same bed with the girl and that very night did the deed of kind with her. The young girl burst into tears. Her mother asked her, “Dear daughter, why are you weeping?” “Mother, such and such happened.” “Well, what’s to be done about it? You ought to have a husband, and he ought to have a wife.” So she made Kumbhaghosaka her son-in-law, and thereafter Kumbhaghosaka and her daughter lived together.*";
P_HTM[895]="***After a few days she sent a message to the king, saying, “Cause the following proclamation to be made, ‘Let those who dwell in the servants’ quarters make holiday. Whoever does not make holiday in his house shall be visited with such and such punishment.’ ” The king did so. Kumbhaghosaka’s mother-in-law said to Kumbhaghosaka, “Dear son the king commands those who dwell in the servants’ quarters to make holiday. What shall we do?” “Mother, I can barely get along on the wages I earn. What shall I do?” “Dear son, those who live in a house of their own can borrow money. The king’s command must not be disobeyed, but a debt can be paid off in some way or other. Go somewhere and get one or two pieces of money.”*";
P_HTM[896]="***Kumbhaghosaka, much provoked, went to the spot where his forty crores of treasure were buried, removed but a single piece of money, and returned with it. His mother-in-law sent this piece of money to the king and paid the expenses of the holiday with a piece of money of her own. Again after a few days she sent the same message to the king. Again the king gave orders, “Let them make holiday. Those who do not shall be visited with such and such punishment.” And again Kumbhaghosaka, under compulsion of his mother-in-law, who repeated the same suggestion she had previously made, went to his hidden store, removed three pieces of money, and brought and gave them to her. She sent these three pieces also to the king. After a few days more had passed, she sent yet another message to the king, saying, “Now let the king send some of his men and summon this man into his presence.”*";
P_HTM[897]="***The king’s men came and began a search for their man, inquiring, “Which man is Kumbhaghosaka?” When they saw Kumbhaghosaka, they said to him, “Come, sir, the king summons you.” Kumbhaghosaka was frightened and was unwilling to go, saying, “The king does not know me,” and much else. But the king’s men overpowered him, and seizing him by the hands and feet, dragged him off. When his mother-in-law saw what they were doing, she reviled them, saying, “Rascally villains, you are not fit to lay hands on my son-in-law.” Turning to Kumbhaghosaka, she said, “Go, my dear son; be not afraid. When I see the king, I will have him cut off the hands of those who seized you by the hands and feet.” So saying, she took her daughter, and preceding the king’s men, went to the royal palace. When she arrived at the palace, she changed her garments, adorned herself with all her adornments, and thus arrayed took her stand on one side.*";
P_HTM[898]="***The king’s men came, pulling and dragging Kumbhaghosaka with them. Kumbhaghosaka paid obeisance to the king and took his stand before him. The king said to him, “You are Kumbhaghosaka?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Why do you practice deceit in spending your great wealth?” “Where is my great wealth, your majesty? I make a living by working for hire.” “Do not act thus. Why do you deceive us?” “I am not deceiving you, your majesty. I have no wealth.” Then the king showed him those pieces of money and asked him, “Whose are these pieces of money?” Kumbhaghosaka recognized the coins. Thought he, “Alas, I am lost! How did these pieces of money get into the hands of the king?” Looking about him, he saw those two women, adorned and bejeweled, standing at the door of the room. Thought he, “This is a deep-laid plot. These women must have been suborned by the king.”*";
P_HTM[899]="***Then said the king to him, “Speak, sir. Why do you act thus?” “I have no protector, your majesty.” “There does not exist a protector who is my equal.” “Your majesty, it would be most agreeable to me if your majesty were my protector.” “That am I, sir. How great is your wealth?” “Forty crores, your majesty.” “What shall I send to convey your wealth hither?” “Carts, your majesty.” So the king had several hundred carts yoked, and sent and had Kumbhaghosaka’s wealth brought and heaped up in the palace court. Then he assembled the residents of Rājagaha and asked, “Is there anyone at all in this city that possesses so much wealth as this?” “There is not, your majesty.” “What should be bestowed upon him?” “Honor, your majesty.” So the king bestowed high honor upon him, appointed him to the post of treasurer, and gave him his daughter in marriage.*";
P_HTM[900]="***The king then took Kumbhaghosaka to the Teacher, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, behold this man. For wisdom the like of him does not exist. Though he possesses forty crores of treasure, he gives no sign of being unduly elated, nor is he puffed up in his own conceit. As though he were a poor man, he dressed himself in rags and worked for his living in the servants’ quarter. In this way I came to know of him. And coming to know of him, I sent for him, made him admit his wealth, caused his wealth to be carried to the palace, appointed him to the post of treasurer, and gave him my daughter in marriage. So wise a man I never saw before.”*";
P_HTM[901]="***Hearing this, the Teacher said, “If a man lives thus, great king, his life is a righteous life. But the deeds of thieves and other wicked men oppress them even in this world and afford them no happiness in the next. For if a man, when his wealth is exhausted, works for hire, his life is a righteous life. For such a man, exerting the power of his manhood, always mindful, pure in deeds and words and thoughts, circumspect of conduct through wisdom, exercising self-restraint in deeds and words and thoughts, leading a righteous life, never relaxing mindfulness, such a man goes from strength to strength.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[902]="***24. If a man exert himself, if he be ever mindful, if his deeds be pure, if he be circumspect of conduct,*";
P_HTM[903]="***If he control himself, if he live in accordance with the Law, if he be heedful, his glory ever increases.*";

P_HTM[905]="***25. By rousing himself, by heedfulness, by controlling himself, by restraining himself,*";
P_HTM[906]="***A wise man may make for himself an island which the flood can never overwhelm.*";
P_HTM[907]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Little Wayman the Elder.*";
P_HTM[908]="***3 a. Birth of Little Wayman*";
P_HTM[909]="***We are told that the daughter of a rich merchant of Rājagaha, upon reaching the age of maturity, was provided by her mother and father with quarters on the topmost floor of a seven-storied palace and guarded with excessive care. But in spite of this, maddened with the madness of youth and lusting for a man, she did the deed of kind with her own slave. Frightened to think that others also might find out about her misconduct, she said to him, “It is out of the question for us to live here any longer. If my mother and father discover my misconduct, they will tear me limb from limb. Let us go live elsewhere.”*";
P_HTM[910]="***So taking a few necessary things they could carry in the hand, they left the house by the principal door. “It matters little,” said they, “where we go, so long as we go and live where others will know nothing about us.” So saying, the two set out together. They took up their residence in a certain place and lived together, with the result that the young wife conceived a child in her womb. When her unborn child reached maturity, she took counsel with her husband, saying, “If I give birth to my child in a place far removed from kith and kin, it will bring suffering to both of us. There is but one place for us to go, and that is home to my parents.” But her husband, fearing that, if he himself went there, he would be killed, kept postponing the day of their departure, saying, “We will go to-day; we will go to-morrow.”*";
P_HTM[911]="***The young wife thought to herself, “This simpleton realizes the enormity of his offense, and therefore dares not go. After all, a mother and a father are one’s best friends. Let this fellow go or not; at any rate I intend to go.” So while her husband was out of the house, she put the household utensils away, and informing her next-door neighbors that she was going home to her parents, she started out on the road. When her husband returned to the house and failed to see her, he inquired of the neighbors where she had gone. Hearing that she had gone home to her parents, he set out after her as fast as he could and overtook her on the road. And right there she gave birth to her child. “What is it, wife?” asked the husband. “Husband, it is a son.” “What shall we do now?” “That for which we intended to go home to my parents has happened by the way. Why, therefore, should we go there? Let us return to our own home.”*";
P_HTM[912]="***Agreeing that this was the best plan, husband and wife returned to their own home. Since their son had been born by the way, they gave him the name Wayman. In no long time the young wife conceived a second child in her womb. (All is to be related in detail precisely as before.) Since this child also was born by the way, they gave him the name Little Wayman, calling the older son Big Wayman. Taking their two sons, they returned to their own place of residence.*";
P_HTM[913]="***While they were living there. Big Wayman heard other boys speak of their uncles and grandparents. So one day he asked his mother, “Mother, other boys speak of their grandfather and grandmother. Haven’t we any relatives?” “Yes, my son. You have no relatives living here, but you have a grandfather, a rich merchant, living in Rājagaha, and we have many other relatives living there too.” “Why don’t we go there, mother?” The mother evaded telling her son why she did not go there. But the children repeated the question time and again. Finally she said to her husband, “These children weary me excessively. Will my mother and father eat us alive when they see us? Come, why not let the children see the family of their grandparents?” “I should not dare meet them face to face, but I will escort you there.” “Very well; some means must be found by which the children can see the family of their grandparents.”*";
P_HTM[914]="***So mother and father took the children, and arriving at Rājagaha in due course, took up their residence in the hall of a certain woman near the gate of the city. Then the mother of the children sent word to her mother and father that she and her children had arrived. When her parents received this message, they said to each other, “As we have passed through the round of existences, we have not previously had a son or a daughter. But these two have grievously offended against us, and it is out of the question for them to stand in our sight. Let these two take as much money as they need and go and live in some pleasant place. However, let them send the children here.” So the two took the money which was sent to them, and giving their children into the hands of the messengers who came, sent them to their grandparents. Thus it happened that the children were brought up in the home of their grandparents.*";
P_HTM[915]="***Of the two children, Little Wayman was still very young. Big Wayman, however, used to accompany his grandfather to hear the Possessor of the Ten Forces preach the Law. And as the result of his frequent visits to the Teacher, his heart inclined to retirement from the world. Accordingly he said to his grandfather, “If you would give me your permission, I should like to retire from the world.” “What say you, dear grandson? There is no one in the whole world whose retirement from the world would give me so much pleasure as your own. If you are able to do so, by all means retire from the world.”*";
P_HTM[916]="***3 b. Little Wayman as a monk*";
P_HTM[917]="***Accordingly the grandfather took Big Wayman to the Teacher, who said, “Householder, you have won a boy?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, this is a grandson of mine who desires to become a monk under you.” The Teacher bade a certain monk on his round for alms to receive the boy into the Order. The Elder assigned to him as a Subject of Meditation the first five of the Constituent Parts of the Body, and then received him into the Order. The youth learned by heart a considerable portion of the Word of the Buddha, kept residence during the season of the rains, made his full profession, and by diligently applying himself to meditation attained Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[918]="***As Big Wayman passed his time in the enjoyment of the bliss of Mystic Meditation, in the enjoyment of the bliss of the Fruit of the Path, he thought to himself, “Assuredly it is in the power of Little Wayman to experience this same bliss.” Therefore he went to the treasurer his grandfather and said to him, “Great treasurer, if you will give your kind permission, I should like to receive Little Wayman into the Order.” “By all means receive him into the Order, Reverend Sir.” We are told that the treasurer was profoundly attached to the Religion of the Buddha, and that when asked, “Of which daughter of yours are these two children the sons?” he felt ashamed to say, “Of my daughter who ran away,” and that for these two reasons he was only too glad to give them permission to retire from the world.*";
P_HTM[919]="***So the Elder Big Wayman received his brother Little Wayman into the Order and established him in the Moral Precepts. But Little Wayman, once received into the Order, proved a dullard. Indeed in four months he was unable to learn by heart this single Stanza,*";
P_HTM[920]="***Even as the lotus, the red lotus, of fragrant perfume, appears at early morn full-blown, with fragrance unimpaired,*";
P_HTM[921]="***Behold the Buddha, resplendent as the blazing sun in the sky.*";
P_HTM[922]="***It seems that, in the dispensation of the Supremely Enlightened Kassapa, he possessed great wisdom, but that, after entering the religious life, he ridiculed and made fun of a certain monk who was a dullard, while the latter was trying to learn the Sacred Word; and that this monk, embarrassed by the ridicule to which he was subjected, was unable either to learn the passage by heart or even to repeat it. As the result of that act, Little Wayman was reborn as a dullard, and every sentence he learned put the preceding sentence out of his mind; indeed four months passed while he was striving to learn this one Stanza.*";
P_HTM[923]="***Thereupon Big Wayman said to his brother, “Little Wayman, it is not in your power to master this religion. In four months you have not been able to learn a single Stanza. How can you ever hope to reach the goal of the Religious Life? Leave the monastery at once.” So saying, he expelled his brother from the Order. But Little Wayman was sincerely attached to the Religion of the Buddha, and the last thing in the world he wished to do was to leave the Order and return to the life of a householder.*";
P_HTM[924]="***Now at that time Jīvaka Komarābhacca, taking an abundant supply of garlands and of various kinds of perfumes, went to his own mango-grove, rendered honor to the Teacher, listened to the Law, and then rising from his seat and paying obeisance to the Teacher, approached Big Wayman, who was steward of the Order, and asked him, “Reverend Sir, how many monks are living with the Teacher?” “Five hundred.” “To-morrow, Reverend Sir, bring the five hundred monks presided over by the Buddha and take a meal in our house.” “The lay disciple Little Wayman is a dullard and has made no progress in the Law. I accept the invitation for all except him.”*";
P_HTM[925]="***When Little Wayman heard that, he thought to himself, “The Elder accepts an invitation for all these monks, but in accepting it, deliberately leaves me out. Beyond a doubt my brother’s affection for me is gone. Of what profit to me any longer is this religion? I will return to the life of a householder and spend my days giving alms and doing other works of merit.” So on the following day, very early in the morning, he set out with the intention of returning to the life of a householder. Very early in the morning also the Teacher surveyed the world, and seeing this incident, preceded Little Wayman to the gate and walked back and forth on the same road Little Wayman had taken.*";
P_HTM[926]="***As Little Wayman came along, he saw the Teacher, and approaching him, paid obeisance to him. Said the Teacher, “But, Little Wayman, where are you going at this hour of the day?” “Reverend Sir, my brother has expelled me from the Order, and therefore I intend to return to the world.” “Little Wayman, it was at my hands that you received admission to the Order. Therefore when your brother expelled you, why did you not come to me? Come now, what have you to do with the life of a householder? You shall remain with me.” So saying, the Teacher stroked him on the head with his hand, the palm of which was marked with the Wheel, and taking him with him, went and seated him over against the Perfumed Chamber. And creating by magic a perfectly clean cloth, he gave it to him, saying, “Little Wayman, remain right here, face towards the East, rub this’ cloth, and say as you do so, ‘Removal of Impurity! Removal of impurity!’ ” Just then meal-time was announced, whereupon the Teacher, accompanied by the Congregation of Monks, went to the house of Jīvaka and sat down on the seat prepared for him.*";
P_HTM[927]="***Little Wayman sat down, facing the sun, and rubbed the cloth, saying as he did so, “Removal of Impurity! Removal of Impurity!” As he rubbed the piece of cloth, it became soiled. Thereupon he thought, “This piece of cloth was perfectly clean before. But through this body of mine it has lost its original character and has become soiled. ‘Impermanent, indeed, are all existing things!’ ” And grasping the thought of decay and death, he developed Insight. The Teacher, knowing that Little Wayman’s mind had attained Insight, said, “Little Wayman, think not that only a piece of cloth has become soiled and dyed with impurity. Indeed within you are lust, impurity, and other defilements; remove them.” And sending forth a luminous image of himself, the Teacher, sitting before him, present in bodily form, as it were, pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[928]="***Lust, not dirt, is properly called impurity; to lust is correctly applied the term “impurity.”*";
P_HTM[929]="***Monks should rid themselves of this form of impurity and live faithful to the religion of him who is devoid of impurity.*";
P_HTM[930]="***Hatred, not dirt, is properly called impurity; to hatred is correctly applied the term “impurity.”*";
P_HTM[931]="***Monks should rid themselves of this form of impurity and live faithful to the religion of him who is devoid of hatred.*";
P_HTM[932]="***Delusion, not dirt, is properly called impurity; to delusion is correctly applied the term “impurity.”*";
P_HTM[933]="***Monks should rid themselves of this form of impurity and live faithful to the religion of him who is devoid of delusion.*";
P_HTM[934]="***At the conclusion of the Stanzas Little Wayman attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties, and with the Supernatural Faculties also a knowledge of the Three Piṭakas.*";
P_HTM[935]="***It appears that in a previous state of existence he was a king. Once, while making a ceremonial circuit of the city, with sweat pouring down his forehead, he wiped his forehead with a clean cloth, whereupon the cloth became soiled. Thought he, “By reason of this body of mine a cloth so clean as this has lost its former character and become soiled. ‘Impermanent, indeed, are all existing things!’ ” Thus did he acquire the concept of Impermanence. In consequence of this, in a later existence, Removal of Impurity became his salvation.*";
P_HTM[936]="***Jīvaka Komarābhacca offered Water of Donation to the Possessor of the Ten Forces. Said the Teacher, covering the bowl with his hand, “Jīvaka, are there no monks in the monastery?” Big Wayman replied, “No, Reverend Sir, there are no monks in the monastery.” Said the Teacher, “But Jīvaka, there are!” “Very well,” said Jīvaka, and sent a man to find out. Said he, “Go to the monastery and find out whether or not there are any monks there.” At that moment Little Wayman said to himself, “My brother says, ‘There are no monks in the monastery.’ I will show him that there are monks in the monastery.” And forthwith he filled the whole mango-grove with monks. Some of them were making robes, others were dyeing robes, others were repeating the Sacred Texts. Thus did Little Wayman create by supernatural power a thousand monks, each different from every other. So when Jīvaka’s messenger saw the numerous monks, he returned and told Jīvaka, “Noble sir, the entire mango-grove is full of monks.” And right there Elder*";
P_HTM[937]="***Wayman, multiplying himself a thousand-fold,*";
P_HTM[938]="***Sat in the charming mango-grove until he was sent for.*";
P_HTM[939]="***Said the Teacher to the man, “Go to the monastery and say, ‘The Teacher summons Little Wayman.’ ” The man went and said what he was told to say. Thereupon the cry went up from a thousand throats, “I am Little Wayman! I am Little Wayman!” The man returned and said, “Reverend Sir, they all say they are Little Wayman.” Said the Teacher, “Well then, go and take by the hand the first man that says, ‘I am Little Wayman,’ and the rest will disappear.” The man did so. Immediately the thousand monks disappeared. The Elder Little Wayman returned with the man who came for him.*";
P_HTM[940]="***At the end of the meal the Teacher addressed Jīvaka, “Jīvaka, take Little Wayman’s bowl, and he will pronounce the words of thanksgiving for you.” Jīvaka took his bowl. The Elder Little Wayman, like a young lion roaring a lion’s roar, pronounced the words of thanksgiving, ranging through the whole of the Three Piṭakas. The Teacher arose from his seat, and surrounded by the Congregation of Monks, went to the monastery. After the monks had shown the Teacher the customary attentions, the Teacher, facing the Perfumed Chamber, admonished the Congregation of Monks with the Admonition of the Happy One, assigned a Subject of Meditation, dismissed the Congregation of Monks, and then, having entered the Perfumed Chamber, the fragrant, perfumed residence in which he resided, lay down lion-like on his right side.*";
P_HTM[941]="***Now at eventide the monks assembled from all quarters, and drawing as it were curtains of crimson blankets, sat down and began to praise the virtues of the Teacher. “Brethren, Big Wayman, not understanding the disposition of Little Wayman, thinking merely, ‘In four months this dullard has not been able to learn a single Stanza,’ expelled him from the monastery. But the Supremely Enlightened, because he is King of Ultimate Truth, within the space of a single meal bestowed Arahatship upon him, and together with Arahatship the Supernatural Faculties, and with the Supernatural Faculties mastery of the Three Piṭakas. Oh, great is the power of the Buddhas!”*";
P_HTM[942]="***Now the Exalted One, knowing that they were discussing this matter in the Hall of Truth, thought to himself, “It is my duty to go to them this very moment.” Accordingly he arose from the Seat of the Buddha, put on his gloriously dyed under and upper garments, girded himself as with lightning, and over his shoulders, like a crimson blanket, threw the great robe of the Happy One. And coming forth from his richly fragrant Perfumed Chamber, and walking with the stride of a noble elephant in rut, with the incomparable grace of a Buddha, he proceeded to the Hall of Truth. And mounting the gloriously arrayed sublime Seat of the Buddha, and diffusing from his body the six-colored rays of a Buddha, even as the sun, newly risen on the top of Mount Yugandhara, agitates the inmost depths of the sea, he sat down in the center of the seat.*";
P_HTM[943]="***Now the moment the Supremely Enlightened One arrived, the Congregation of Monks ceased their talk, became silent. The Teacher surveyed the assemblage with soft, kind heart and said, “This assemblage delights my heart beyond measure. Not a single hand is out of place, not a single foot is out of place; not a cough is to be heard, not a sneeze is to be heard; all these monks, reverent with reverence for the Buddha, subdued by the majesty of the Buddha, though I were to sit here for an aeon and not speak, would refrain from speaking first, would not so much as open their lips. I alone have the right to decide when it is proper to begin to speak. Therefore will I speak first.”*";
P_HTM[944]="***Accordingly with sweet voice, a voice like that of Great Brahmā, he addressed the monks, “Monks, what is the subject of your conversation now, as you sit here all gathered together? What was the subject of the discussion which you so suddenly broke off?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is not the first time Little Wayman has proved a dullard. In a previous state of existence also he was a dullard. This is not the first time I have been his refuge. In a previous state of existence also I was his refuge. But in a previous state of existence I made him master of the wealth of this world. Just now I made him master of wealth that transcends this world.” The monks desired to hear all about it. Responding to their requests, he related the following*";
P_HTM[945]="***3 c. Story of the Past: The world-renowned teacher, the young man, and the king of Benāres*";
P_HTM[946]="***Once upon a time a certain young man who lived in the city of Benāres went to Takkasilā for the purpose of acquiring the arts and became the pupil of a world-renowned teacher. He was by all odds the most helpful to the teacher of all the five hundred young men who were his pupils. All of his duties, such as bathing and perfuming the feet, he performed most faithfully. But he was such a dullard that he was not able to learn a single thing. The teacher thought, “This young man is most helpful to me; I will instruct him in the arts.” But in spite of his best efforts he was unable to teach him a single thing. When, after a long residence, the young man was unable to learn a single Stanza, he became discouraged, and resolving to return home, asked leave of the teacher.*";
P_HTM[947]="***The teacher thought to himself, “This young man is a devoted servitor of mine. I should like to make a learned man of him, but this I cannot do. However, I ought certainly to make him some return for the assistance he has rendered me. I will compose a certain charm for him and give it to him.” So he took him to the forest and composed for him the charm, “You’re rubbing! you’re rubbing! Why are you rubbing? I know too!” And this charm he taught him, causing him to repeat it many hundred times. “Do you know it now?” asked the teacher. “Yes,” replied the young man; “I know it now.” Thought the teacher, “If a dullard by dint of hard labor once learns by heart a form of words, it will never leave him.” And giving him money to defray the expenses of his journey, he dismissed him, saying, “Now go make your living by this charm. But in order that you may not forget it, keep repeating it over and over.” When he arrived at Benāres, his mother said to herself, “My son has returned after acquiring the arts,” and held high festival in his honor.*";
P_HTM[948]="***It happened just at this time that the king of Benāres made a careful examination of his thoughts, words, and deeds for the purpose of discovering whether he had been guilty of any fault. So far as he could see, he had been guilty of no impropriety. But he reflected, “A person never sees his own faults; it takes other persons to see them. I will make a tour of the city and listen to what others say about me. When people have eaten supper and have sat down, they gossip and talk about all sorts of things. If I am ruling unjustly, they will say, ‘We are utterly ruined by the punishments, taxes, and other oppressions of our wicked king.’ If, on the other hand, I am ruling justly, they will comment on my good qualities, paying me many compliments and saying, ‘Long life to our king!’ ” So at nightfall he put on a disguise and went about the city, walking close to the walls of their houses.*";
P_HTM[949]="***At that moment some tunnel-thieves began to dig a tunnel between two houses in order to enter two houses by the same tunnel. The king saw them and took his stand in the shadow of the house. Now in this house lived the young man who had just returned from Takkasilā with the charm. When the thieves had dug the tunnel, they entered the house and began to look over the goods in the house. Just then the young man woke up and began to repeat his charm, “You’re rubbing! you’re rubbing! Why are you rubbing? I know too!” When the thieves heard this, they exclaimed, “This man knows what we are up to. Now he will kill us.” And forthwith, dropping even the clothes they had on, they fled in terror in the first direction that was handy. The king, seeing them fleeing and hearing the words of the young man as he repeated his charm, continued his tour of the city and then entered the royal residence.*";
P_HTM[950]="***When the night grew bright and the dawn came, the king summoned a certain man and said to him, “My man, go into such and such a street, and in a certain house, where a tunnel has been dug, you will find a young man who has just returned from Takkasilā after learning the various arts. Bring him to me.” The man went and said to the young man, “The king summons you,” and conducted him to the king. The king said to him, “Friend, are you the young man that has just returned from Takkasilā after learning the various arts?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Give us this charm also.” “Very well, your majesty. Sit down on the same seat with me and learn it.” The king sat down on the same seat with him, learned the charm, and then said to him, “Here is your fee as teacher,” and gave him a thousand pieces of money.*";
P_HTM[951]="***Just at this time the commander-in-chief of the army said to the king’s barber, “When do you expect to shave the king’s beard?” “To-morrow or the day after.” The commander-in-chief of the army gave the king’s barber a thousand pieces of money and said to him, “I have something for you to do.” “What is it, master?” “Go through the form of shaving the king’s beard, but grind your razor very sharp and cut his windpipe. Then you shall be commander-in-chief of the army and I shall be king.” “Very well,” said the barber, agreeing to the bargain.*";
P_HTM[952]="***When the day came for the barber to shave the king’s beard, he moistened the king’s beard with scented water, sharpened his razor, and applied it to the king’s cheek. Discovering that the razor was slightly dull, and realizing that he must cut the king’s windpipe with a single stroke, he stepped aside and began to sharpen his razor again. At that moment the king remembered his charm and began to repeat it, saying, “You’re rubbing! you’re rubbing! Why are you rubbing? I know too! I know!” Beads of sweat stood out on the forehead of the barber. “The king knows all about this business,” thought he. He flung his razor to the ground in terror and prostrated himself on his breast before the feet of the king.*";
P_HTM[953]="***Now kings know a thing or two; and the king of Benāres immediately said to the barber, “Scoundrel of a barber, you thought to yourself, ‘The king doesn’t know about this.’ ” “Spare my life, your majesty.” “Very well; fear not. Tell me about it.” “Your majesty, the commander-in-chief of the army gave me a thousand pieces of money, saying to me, ‘Go through the form of shaving the king’s beard, but cut his windpipe. Then I shall be king and you shall be commander-in-chief of the army.’ ”*";
P_HTM[954]="***The king thought to himself, “It is due to my teacher that my life was spared.” He sent for the commander-in-chief of the army and said to him, “Well, commander-in-chief, what is there that you have not received from me? Henceforth I can endure to look upon you no longer. Depart from my kingdom.” With these words he banished him from the kingdom. Then he sent for the young man who had been his teacher and said to him, “Teacher, it is due to you that my life was spared.” And when he had so said, he bestowed high honor upon him and made him commander-in-chief of his army. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[955]="***“At that time,” said the Teacher, “the young man was Little Wayman, and the world-renowned teacher was the Teacher himself.” Therefore when the Teacher had finished this Story of the Past, he said, “Monks, thus in a previous state of existence also Little Wayman was a dullard, and at that time also I became his refuge and established him in the possession of the wealth of this world.” Again one day the monks began a discussion, “The Teacher indeed became a refuge to Little Wayman.” Thereupon the Teacher related the Story of the Past found in the Culla-Seṭṭhi Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[956]="***A man who is wise and intelligent can elevate himself to high position in the world with but little wealth,*";
P_HTM[957]="***Even as by blowing a tiny flame one can start a great fire.*";
P_HTM[958]="***Having pronounced this Stanza, the Teacher said, “Monks, this is not the first time I have been a refuge to Little Wayman; in a previous state of existence also I was a refuge to him. But in a previous state of existence I made him master of the wealth of this world; just now I made him master of wealth that transcends the world. At that time the young pupil was Little Wayman and the young merchant was I myself.” Thus did he identify the characters in the Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[959]="***Again one day in the Hall of Truth the monks began a discussion: “Brethren, in four months Little Wayman was unable to learn by heart a Stanza of four verses; but because he never relaxed the powers of his will, he became established in Arahatship and has just now become master of wealth that transcends this world.” The Teacher came in and asked, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, a monk who exerts all the powers of his will in following the Precepts cannot fail to make himself master of wealth that transcends this world.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[960]="***25. By rousing himself, by heedfulness, by controlling himself, by restraining himself,*";
P_HTM[961]="***A wise man may make for himself an island which the flood can never overwhelm.*";

P_HTM[963]="***26. Simpletons are given to heedlessness...*";
P_HTM[964]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Simpletons’ Holiday, Bālanakkhatta.*";
P_HTM[965]="***For on a certain date there was a festival celebrated in Sāvatthi called Simpletons’ Holiday, and on the occasion of this festival foolish, unintelligent folk used to smear their bodies with ashes and cow-dung and for a period of seven days go about uttering all manner of coarse talk. At this time people showed no respect for kinsfolk or friends or monks when they met them, but stood in the doorways and insulted them with coarse talk. Those who could not endure the coarse talk would pay the holiday-makers a half or a quarter or a penny, according to their means, and the holiday-makers would take the money and depart from their houses.*";
P_HTM[966]="***Now at this time there were in Sāvatthi five crores of Noble Disciples, and they sent word to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, let the Exalted One refrain for a period of seven days from entering the city with the Congregation of Monks; let him instead remain at the monastery.” And for a period of seven days the Noble Disciples caused food to be prepared for the Congregation of Monks at the monastery and sent it to them, but did not themselves leave their houses. On the eighth day, however, when the festival was at an end, they invited the Congregation of Monks to be their guests, escorted them into the city, and gave abundant offerings. And having seated themselves respectfully on one side, they said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, we have spent the past seven days most unpleasantly. Our ears had like to burst from hearing the coarse talk of foolish folk. No one showed any respect for anybody else, and for this reason we did not permit you to enter the city. We ourselves did not go out of the house.” The Teacher listened to what they said, and then replied, “After this manner do foolish, unintelligent men conduct themselves. But they that are intelligent preserve heedfulness as their greatest treasure, and by so doing at last attain the attainment of the Deathless, Great Nibbāna.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[967]="***26. Simpletons, folk of little intelligence, are given to heedlessness;*";
P_HTM[968]="***But the intelligent man preserves heedfulness as his greatest treasure.*";
P_HTM[969]="***27. Give not yourselves up to heedlessness; indulge not in lust and sensual pleasure;*";

P_HTM[973]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Mahā Kassapa.*";
P_HTM[974]="***For on a certain day, while the Elder was in residence at Pipphali Cave, he made his round of Rājagaha for alms, and after he had returned from his round for alms and had eaten his breakfast, he sat down and developed Insight, surveying with Supernatural Vision all living beings, both heedless and heedful, in the water, on the earth, on the mountains, and elsewhere, both coming into existence and passing out of existence.*";
P_HTM[975]="***The Teacher, seated at Jetavana, exercised Supernatural Vision and pondered within himself, “With what is my son Kassapa occupied to-day?” Straightway he became aware of the following, “He is contemplating the rising and falling of living beings.” And he said, “Knowledge of the rising and falling of living beings may not be compassed even with the Knowledge of a Buddha. Living beings pass from one existence to another and obtain a new conception in a mother’s womb without the knowledge of mother or father, and knowledge thereof may not be compassed. To know them is beyond your range, Kassapa, for your range is very slight. It comes within range of the Buddhas alone to know and to see in their totality the rising and falling of living beings.” So saying, he sent forth a radiant image of himself, and as it were sitting down face to face with Kassapa, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[976]="***28. When the wise man banishes heedlessness by heedfulness,*";

P_HTM[980]="***29. Heedful among the heedless...*";
P_HTM[981]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to two brethren.*";
P_HTM[982]="***It appears that these two monks obtained a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher and retired to a forest hermitage. Early in the morning one of them brought firewood, prepared the charcoal-dish, and during the first watch sat and chatted with the probationers and novices. The other, a heedful monk, engaged in meditation, thus admonished his friend, “Brother, do not act thus. For a monk that is heedless stand ready four states of suffering, as if they were his own house. The favor of the Buddhas may not be won by double-dealing.” When the lazy monk paid no attention to his admonition, the zealous monk said, “This monk cannot endure to be spoken to.” Having failed to spur his comrade to greater effort, the zealous monk, abiding in heedfulness, resumed his meditations.*";
P_HTM[983]="***The slothful Elder, having warmed himself during the first watch, entered the monastery just as his friend, having finished his walk, entered his cell. Said the slothful monk to the zealous monk, “Slothful one, you entered the forest for the purpose of lying down and sleeping. Seeing that you obtained a Subject of Meditation from the Buddhas, ought you not rather to rise and devote yourself to the practice of meditation?” So saying, he entered his own place of residence, lay down, and went to sleep. But his friend, after walking up and down during the first watch and resting during the second watch, rose in the last watch and devoted himself to the practice of meditation. Living thus the life of heedfulness, in no long time he attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. The other monk, however, spent his time in utter heedlessness.*";
P_HTM[984]="***When the two monks had completed residence, they went to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and sat down respectfully on one side. The Teacher exchanged friendly greetings with them and queried, “I trust that you have lived the life of heedfulness and that you have devoted yourselves earnestly to the practice of meditation. I trust that you have reached the goal of the Religious Life.” The heedless monk replied, “Reverend Sir, how can this monk be said to be heedful? From the time he left you he has done nothing but lie and sleep.” “But you monk?” “I, Reverend Sir, betimes in the morning brought firewood and prepared the charcoal-dish, and during the first watch I sat and warmed myself, but I did not spend my time sleeping.” Then said the Teacher to the slothful monk, “You who have spent your time in heedlessness say, ‘I am heedful.’ You mistake heedlessness for heedfulness. Compared with my son, you are like a decrepit hack; but he, compared with you, is like a racer.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[985]="***29. Heedful among the heedless, watchful among the sleeping,*";
P_HTM[986]="***Even as a racer outstrips a hack, even so goes a wise man.*";

P_HTM[991]="***7 a. Story of the Present: Mahāli’s question*";
P_HTM[992]="***For a Licchavi prince named Mahāli, who lived at Vesali, hearing the Teacher recite the Suttanta entitled Sakka’s Question, thought to himself, “The Supremely Enlightened has described the great glory of Sakka. Has the Teacher seen Sakka? or has he not seen Sakka? Is the Teacher acquainted with Sakka? or is he not acquainted with Sakka? I will ask him.” So the Licchavi prince Mahāli drew near to where the Exalted One was, and having drawn near, saluted the Exalted One and sat down on one side. And having sat down on one side, the Licchavi prince Mahāli spoke thus to the Exalted One, “Reverend Sir, has the Exalted One seen Sakka king of gods?” “Yes, Mahāli, I have indeed seen Sakka king of gods.” “Reverend Sir, it must certainly have been a counterfeit of Sakka; for, Reverend Sir, it is a difficult matter to see Sakka king of gods.” “Nevertheless, Mahāli, I know Sakka; I know what qualities made him Sakka; I know by the cultivation of what qualities Sakka attained Sakkaship.*";
P_HTM[993]="***“Mahāli, in a previous state of existence Sakka king of gods was a human being, a prince named Magha; therefore is he called Maghavā. Mahāli, in a previous state of existence Sakka king of gods was a human being who in a previous state of existence gave gifts (pure dānaṁ adāsi); therefore is he called Purindada. Mahāli, in a previous state of existence Sakka king of gods was a human being, who gave alms assiduously (sakkaccaṁ); therefore is he called Sakka. Mahāli, in a previous state of existence Sakka king of gods was a human being who gave a dwelling-place (āvasathaṁ); therefore is he called Vāsava. Mahāli in a previous state of existence Sakka king of gods was a human being who could think of as many as a thousand things (sahassaṁ atthaṁ) in an instant; therefore is he called Sahassakkha. Mahāli, Sakka king of gods has an Asura maiden named Sujātā to wife; therefore is he called Sujampati. Mahāli, Sakka king of gods bears sway as lord and master over the Gods of the Thirty-three; therefore is he called King of Gods. Mahāli, Sakka king of gods in a previous state of existence as a human being took upon himself and fulfilled seven vows. Because he took upon himself and fulfilled these seven vows, Sakka attained Sakkaship.*";
P_HTM[994]="***“Now what were the seven? ‘So long as I live, may I be the support of my mother and father. So long as I live, may I honor my elders. So long as I live, may I speak gentle words. So long as I live, may I never give way to backbiting. So long as I live, may I live the life of a householder with heart free from taint of avarice, generous in renunciation of what is mine, with open hand, delighting in liberality, attentive to petitions, delighting in the distribution of alms. So long as I live, may I speak the truth. So long as I live, may I be free from anger. Should anger spring up within me, may I quickly suppress it.’ Mahāli, Sakka king of gods in a previous state of existence took upon himself and fulfilled seven vows. Because he took upon himself and fulfilled these seven vows, Sakka attained Sakkaship.”*";
P_HTM[995]="***If a man support his mother and father, if he honor his elders in the household,*";
P_HTM[996]="***If he be gentle and friendly in conversation, if he avoid backbiting,*";
P_HTM[997]="***If he steadfastly put away avarice, if he be truthful, if he suppress anger,*";
P_HTM[998]="***Such a man the Gods of the Thirty-three call a good man.*";
P_HTM[999]="***When the Teacher said, “This, Mahāli, was what Sakka did in his previous existence as Prince Magha,” Mahāli, desiring to hear the whole story of his conduct, asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, how did Prince Magha conduct himself?” “Well then,” said the Teacher, “listen.” So saying, he related the following*";
P_HTM[1000]="***7 b. Story of the Past: How Magha became Sakka*";
P_HTM[1001]="***In times long past a prince named Magha lived in the village of Macala in the kingdom of Magadha. One day he went to the place where the business of the village was carried on, removed with his foot the dust from the place where he stood, and having made a comfortable place for himself, stood there. Thereupon another struck him with his arm, pushed him aside, and took his place. But instead of becoming angry at the man, he made another comfortable place for himself and stood there. Thereupon another struck him with his arm, pushed him away, and took his place. But neither did he allow himself to become angry at this man; he merely made another comfortable place for himself and stood there. In like manner one man after another came out of his house, struck him with his arm, and pushed him away from the place which he had cleared for himself.*";
P_HTM[1002]="***The prince thought to himself, “All these men appear to be pleased. Since this work of mine conduces to the happiness of men, it must be a meritorious work.” So on the following day he took a spade and cleared a space as big as a threshing-floor, whereupon all the men came and stood there. In cold weather he built a fire to warm them, so that the place became a favorite resort for all. Then he thought to himself, “It behooves me to take upon myself the task of making the road smooth and even.” So early in the morning he started out to make the road smooth and even, cutting down and removing all the branches of trees that needed to be removed. Thus did he spend his time.*";
P_HTM[1003]="***Another man saw him and said to him, “Master, what are you doing?” He replied, “Master, I am treading the Path that leads to Heaven.” “I also am your companion.” “Be my companion, master; heaven is a pleasant place for many.” Seeing these two, a third man asked the same question, received the same answer, and joined them; then a fourth, then a fifth, until finally there were thirty-three.*";
P_HTM[1004]="***All these men worked together with spades and axes and made the road smooth and even for a distance of one or two leagues. The village headman saw them and thought to himself, “These men are all following the wrong occupation. If they would only fetch fish and flesh from the forest, or indulge in strong drink, or do something else of the sort, I should make something by it.” So he sent for them and asked them, “What is it you are doing?” “Treading the Path to Heaven, master.” “That is no proper occupation for men living the lives of laymen. What you should do is to bring fish and flesh from the forest, indulge in strong drink, and have a general good time.” But they refused to follow his suggestion, and the more he urged them, the more firmly they refused to do as he suggested.*";
P_HTM[1005]="***Finally the village headman became angry. “I will destroy them,” said he. So he went to the king and said to him, “Your majesty, I see a band of thieves going about committing depredations.” The king replied, “Go catch them and bring them before me.” So the village headman arrested the thirty-three youths and haled them before the king. Without instituting an inquiry into their conduct, the king gave the following order, “Cause them to be trampled to death by an elephant.” Thereupon Magha admonished his companions as follows, “Friends, we have no refuge but love. Therefore let your hearts be tranquil. Cherish anger towards no one. Let your hearts be full of love for the king and the village headman and the elephant that tramples you under his feet.” The thirty-three youths followed the admonition of their leader. Such was the power of their love that the elephant dared not approach them.*";
P_HTM[1006]="***When the king heard of this, he said, “If the elephant sees so many men, he will not venture to trample them under his feet. Have the men covered with heavy matting, and then order the elephant to trample them.” So the village headman had the men covered with heavy matting and drove the elephant forwards to trample them. But when the elephant was yet a long way off, he turned round and went back. When the king heard what had happened, he thought to himself, “There must be some reason for this.” So he caused the thirty-three youths to be brought before him and asked them, “Friends, is there anything which you have failed to receive at my hands?” “Your majesty, what do you mean?” “I am informed that you are a band of thieves and that you rove about the forest committing depredations.” “Your majesty, who said that?” “Friends, the village headman so informed me.”*";
P_HTM[1007]="***“Your majesty, it is not true that we are thieves. The fact is, we are clearing a Path to Heaven for ourselves, and we do this and that. The village headman tried to persuade us to adopt an evil mode of life, and when we refused to follow his suggestions, he became angry at us and determined to destroy us. That is why he said this about us.” “Friends, this animal knows your good qualities; but I, who am a man, was unable to discern them. Pardon me.” So saying, the king made the village headman their slave, together with his children and wife, gave them a riding-elephant, and presented that village to them to do with as they saw fit. Thought the thirty-three youths, “Even in this life the advantage to be derived from the performance of works of merit is clearly to be seen.” And mounting the elephant by turns, they rode about the village.*";
P_HTM[1008]="***As they went about the village, they took counsel together, saying, “It is our duty to perform yet more abundant works of merit. What shall we do?” Thereupon the following thought occurred to them, “Let us build at the crossing of the four highways a rest-house for the multitude, making it secure and strong.” So they summoned a builder and ordered him to build a hall for them. And because desire for women had departed from them, they resolved to give women no share in the building of the hall.*";
P_HTM[1009]="***Now there were four women living in Magha’s house, Joy, Thoughtful, Goodness, and Wellborn. Goodness went secretly to the builder, gave him a bribe, and said to him, “Brother, give me the principal share in the building of this hall.” “Very well,” replied the builder, agreeing to her proposal. Accordingly he first marked a tree out of which to make a pinnacle, felled it, and laid it aside to season. Then he hewed it and planed it and bored it, and having fashioned it in the form of a pinnacle, carved the following inscription on it, “This is the Hall of Goodness.” Having so done, he wrapped it in a cloth and laid it aside.*";
P_HTM[1010]="***Now when he had completed the hall and the day came to erect the pinnacle, he said to the thirty-three youths, “Noble sirs, there is something we have forgotten.” “What is it, sir?” “A pinnacle.” “Let us procure one.” “It is impossible to make one out of a freshly hewn tree. We should procure for a pinnacle a tree felled long ago and laid away to season.” “What had we best do under the circumstances?” “If in anybody’s house there is a completed pinnacle which has been laid away to season and which is for sale, that is the thing for you to search for.” So they searched everywhere, and finding what they wanted in the house of Goodness, offered her a thousand pieces of money for it. But they were unable to secure it for the price they offered. Said Goodness, “If you will give me a share in the building of the hall, I will give you the pinnacle.” But they replied, “We have resolved to give women no share in the building of this hall.” Thereupon the builder said to them, “Noble sirs, what are you doing? With the exception of the World of Brahmā, there is no place from which women are excluded. Take the pinnacle, for if you do, our work will speedily be finished.” “Very well,” said they. So they took the pinnacle and completed the hall. And they divided the hall into three parts, reserving one chamber for kings, another for the poor, and another for the sick.*";
P_HTM[1011]="***Then the thirty-three youths built thirty-three seats, and having so done, gave the following orders to the elephant, “If a visitor comes and sits down in a seat, take him and lodge him in the house of whoever built and owns that seat. It then becomes the duty of the owner of that seat to see that his guest’s feet and back are rubbed, to provide him with food both hard and soft, and with lodging; to perform for him, in fact, all the duties of hospitality.” Accordingly, whenever a visitor came, the elephant would take him and conduct him to the house of the owner of the seat in which he had sat, and the owner of the seat would on that day perform for him all the duties of hospitality.*";
P_HTM[1012]="***Magha planted an ebony-tree near the hall and built a stone seat at the foot of the ebony-tree. All those who entered the hall looked at the pinnacle, read the inscription, and said, “This is the Hall of Goodness.” The names of the thirty-three youths did not appear.*";
P_HTM[1013]="***Joy thought to herself, “The youths who built this hall resolved to deprive us of a share in the building thereof. But Goodness by her own cleverness obtained a share. I also ought to do something. What can I do?” Thereupon the following thought occurred to her, “Those who come to the hall should be provided with water for drinking and water for bathing. I will have a place dug for a pool.” Accordingly Joy caused a bathing-pool to be built.*";
P_HTM[1014]="***Thoughtful thought to herself, “Goodness has given a pinnacle, and Joy has caused a swimming-pool to be built. What can I do?” Thereupon the following thought occurred to her, “After those who come to the hall have drunk water and bathed, they should be decked with garlands when they are ready to depart. I will cause a flower garden to be laid out.” So Thoughtful caused a beautiful flower garden to be laid out. So many and so various were the flowers that grew therein that it was impossible for anyone to say, “Such and such a flower-bearing or fruit-bearing tree does not grow in this garden.”*";
P_HTM[1015]="***Now Wellborn thought to herself, “I am the daughter of the brother of the mother of Magha and likewise the wife of Magha. The merit of the work he has wrought accrues to me only, and the merit of the work I have wrought accrues to him only.” Accordingly she did nothing but spend her time adorning herself.*";
P_HTM[1016]="***Thus did Magha minister to his mother and father, honor his elders in the household, speak the truth, avoid harsh words, avoid backbiting, put away avarice, suppress anger. Even thus did he fulfill the Seven Precepts, as it is said:*";
P_HTM[1017]="***If a man support his mother and father, if he honor his elders in the household.*";
P_HTM[1018]="***If he be gentle and friendly in conversation, if he avoid backbiting,*";
P_HTM[1019]="***If he steadfastly put away avarice, if he be truthful, if he suppress anger.*";
P_HTM[1020]="***Such a man the Gods of the Thirty-three call a good man.*";
P_HTM[1021]="***Having attained so praiseworthy a state, Magha, upon reaching the end of the term of life allotted to him, was reborn in the World of the Thirty-three as Sakka king of gods. His companions were likewise reborn there. The builder was reborn god Vissakamma.*";
P_HTM[1022]="***Now at that time there were Asuras dwelling in the World of the Thirty-three, and when they learned that new gods had been reborn there, they prepared celestial drink for them. But Sakka gave orders to his retinue that no one should drink thereof. The Asuras, however, drank freely and became intoxicated. Thereupon Sakka thought to himself, “Why should I share my kingdom with these deities?” Forthwith, giving a sign to his retinue, he caused them to pick up the Asuras by the heels and fling them into the Great Ocean. So the Asuras fell headlong into the Ocean. By the power of their merit there sprang up at the foot of Mount Sineru the Palace of the Asuras and the Tree that is called Pied Trumpet-flower.*";
P_HTM[1023]="***When the conflict between the gods and the Asuras was over and the Asuras had been defeated, there came into existence the City of the Thirty-three. The distance from the eastern gate to the western gate was ten thousand leagues, and the distance from the southern gate to the northern gate was the same. Now this city was provided with a thousand gates and was adorned with gardens and pools, and in the midst thereof, as the fruit of the building of the hall, there arose a palace called the Palace of Victory. Its height was seven hundred leagues, and it was decked with banners three hundred leagues long. On staffs of gold were banners of jewels, and on staffs of jewels were banners of gold; on staffs of coral were banners of pearls, and on staffs of pearls were banners of coral; on staffs of the seven precious stones were banners of the seven precious stones. Such was the palace that arose as the fruit of the building of the hall; a thousand leagues was its height, and it was composed of the seven precious stones.*";
P_HTM[1024]="***As the result of the planting of the ebony-tree, there arose the Coral-tree, a hundred leagues in circumference. As the result of the building of the stone seat, there came into existence at the foot of the Coral-tree the Yellowstone throne, of a reddish yellow color like that of the jasmine flower, sixty leagues in length, fifty leagues in breadth, and fifteen leagues thick. When Sakka sits down on this throne, half its mass sinks into the ground; when he rises, it is all above ground. The elephant was reborn as god Erāvaṇa. There are no animals in the World of the Gods; so when he went into the garden to play, he would quit his form as a god and become the elephant Erāvaṇa, a hundred and fifty leagues in size. For the thirty-three youths, Erāvaṇa created thirty-three water-pots, each two or three quarters of a league around.*";
P_HTM[1025]="***In the center of all, Erāvaṇa created for Sakka a water-pot called Beautiful. It was thirty leagues in circumference, and above it was a canopy, twelve leagues in size, made entirely of precious stones. At regular intervals about the canopy there arose banners a league in length, made entirely of the seven precious stones. And from the lower edge of each banner depended a row of tinkling bells, which, when they were shaken by the gentle wind, gave forth sweet music like the mingled strains of the music of the five kinds of instruments or the singing of the celestial choir. In the center of the pavilion was prepared for Sakka a jeweled couch a league in length. There Sakka reclined in state. Erāvaṇa created thirty-three water-pots for the thirty-three gods. Each vessel bore seven tusks, each fifty leagues long; each tusk bore seven lotus-tanks; each lotus-tank bore seven lotus-plants; each lotus-plant bore seven flowers; each flower, seven leaves; and on each leaf danced seven celestial nymphs. Thus on all sides round about for a space of fifty leagues there were dancing-assemblies poised on elephants’ tusks. Such was the glory in the enjoyment of which lived Sakka king of gods.*";
P_HTM[1026]="***When Goodness died, she was also reborn there. And at the same time there came into existence Goodness, Moot-hall of the gods, nine hundred leagues in extent, than which exists no other place more charming. Here, on the eighth day of the month, is preached the Law. Unto this day, when men behold a charming place, they say, “It is like Goodness, Moot-hall of the gods.” When Joy died, she also was reborn there. And at the same time there came into existence a lotus-tank called Joy, five hundred leagues in extent. When Thoughtful died, she also was reborn there. And at the same time there came into existence Thoughtful’s Creeper-grove, five hundred leagues in extent. Thither they conduct the gods whose prognostics have appeared, and walk rejoicing. But when Wellborn died, she was reborn as a crane in a certain mountain-cave.*";
P_HTM[1027]="***Sakka surveyed his wives and considered within himself, “Goodness has been reborn here and likewise Joy and Thoughtful. Now where has Wellborn been reborn?” Perceiving that she had been reborn as a crane in a mountain-cave, he thought to himself, “Because she wrought no work of merit, the foolish girl has been reborn as an animal. It is my duty to have her perform some work of merit and bring her here.” So saying, he laid aside his proper form, and assuming a disguise, he went to her and asked, “What are you doing here?” “But, master, who are you?” “I am your husband, Magha.” “Where were you reborn, husband?” “I was reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-three. Do you know where your companions were reborn?” “No, husband, I do not.” “They also were reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-three as my wives. Should you like to see your companions?” “How can I get there?” Said Sakka, “I will carry you thither.”*";
P_HTM[1028]="***Placing her in the palm of his hand, he carried her to the World of the Gods and set her free on the bank of the lotus-tank named Joy. Then he said to the other three, “Should you like to see your companion Wellborn?” “Sire, where is she?” “On the bank of the lotus-tank named Joy.” So the three went and looked at her. “Alas!” they cried out, “see what has been the result of the noble woman’s spending her life in the adornment of self! Look now at her beak! Look at her feet! Look at her legs! She presents a beautiful appearance indeed!” Thus did they ridicule her. Having so done, they departed.*";
P_HTM[1029]="***Sakka went once more to her and said, “Did you see your companions?” “Yes,” replied Wellborn, “I saw them. They ridiculed me and then went their way. Take me back again.” So Sakka took her back again, set her free in the water, and then asked her, “Did you see their celestial glory?” “Yes, Sire, I did.” “You also should employ such means as will enable you to obtain rebirth there.” “Sire, what shall I do?” “If I admonish you, will you keep my admonition?” “Yes, Sire, I will keep your admonition.” So Sakka taught her the Five Precepts. Having so done, he said to her, “Be zealous in keeping the Precepts,” and departed.*";
P_HTM[1030]="***Thenceforth she sought after and ate only such fish as had died a natural death. After a few days had passed, Sakka determined to test her. So he went, and taking the form of a fish, lay down on the surface of the sand, pretending to be dead. When she saw the fish, thinking that it was dead, she took it in her beak. Just as she was about to swallow the fish, it wriggled its tail. The instant she discovered the fish was alive she released it in the water. Sakka waited a little while, and then lay down before her on his back once more. Again thinking it was a dead fish, she took it in her beak. But just as she was about to swallow the fish, it moved the tip of its tail. The instant she saw the fish move its tail she knew it was alive, and therefore let it go. When Sakka had thus tested her three times and had satisfied himself that she was keeping the Precepts faithfully, he revealed his identity to her and said, “I came here for the purpose of testing you. You are keeping the Precepts faithfully. If you continue thus faithfully to keep them, you will before long be reborn as one of my wives. Be heedful.” So saying these words, he departed.*";
P_HTM[1031]="***Thenceforth she used for food either fish that had died a natural death or none at all. After only a few days had passed, she shriveled up and died, and solely as the fruit of her virtuous conduct was reborn at Benāres as the daughter of a potter. When she was about fifteen or sixteen years old, Sakka considered within himself, “Where has she been reborn?” Perceiving that she had been reborn at Benāres as the daughter of a potter, he said to himself, “I ought now to go to her.”*";
P_HTM[1032]="***So filling a cart with the seven kinds of precious stones disguised as cucumbers, he drove into the city of Benāres. “Come, get cucumbers!” he cried, as he entered the street. But when people came to him with coins in their hands, he said, “I do not part with my cucumbers for a price.” “On what terms do you part with them, then?” the people asked him. “I give them to the woman that keeps the Precepts,” he replied. “Master, what do you mean by ‘precepts’? Are they black or brown or of some other color?” “You don’t even know what Precepts are; much less will you keep them. I will give my cucumbers to the woman who keeps the Precepts.”*";
P_HTM[1033]="***“Master, there is a potter’s daughter who is always going about saying, ‘I keep the Precepts.’ Give them to her.” The potter’s daughter said to him, “Very well, master, give them to me.” “Who are you?” “I am a maiden that has never failed to keep the Precepts.” “For you alone have I brought these,” said Sakka. And driving his cart to her house, he presented to her, in the guise of cucumbers, celestial treasure which cannot be taken away by others. And making his identity known to her, he said, “Here is wealth sufficient for you to live on. Keep the Five Precepts unbroken.” So saying, he departed.*";
P_HTM[1034]="***At the end of her existence as a potter’s daughter she was reborn in the World of the Asuras as the daughter of Vepacitti, king of Asuras, a bitter enemy of Sakka. Since she had kept the Precepts in two successive existences, she was fair of form, her skin was of a golden hue, and she was endowed with beauty and comeliness the like of which had never been seen. Vepacitti, king of Asuras, said to all the Asura princes who sought her in marriage, “You are not fit to marry my daughter.” Having thus refused to give her in marriage to any of the Asura princes, he said, “My daughter shall choose for herself such a husband as she sees fit.” So saying, he assembled the host of Asuras, and placing a garland of flowers in the hand of his daughter, said to her, “Choose for yourself a husband who suits you.”*";
P_HTM[1035]="***At that moment Sakka looked to see where she had been reborn. Perceiving what was taking place, he assumed the form of an aged Asura and went and stood in the outer circle of the assembled company. The daughter of Vepacitti looked this way and that. Suddenly, because in a previous state of existence she had lived with Sakka, she was overwhelmed as by a mighty torrent by the power of the love for him which sprang up within her. And crying out, “He is my husband!” she threw the garland of flowers over his head. Said the Asuras, “For a long time our king has been unable to find a husband suitable for his daughter. Now, however, he has found one. This fellow is old enough to be his daughter’s grandfather.” And they departed, hanging their heads with shame.*";
P_HTM[1036]="***Sakka took her by the hand, cried out, “I am Sakka,” and flew up into the air. The Asuras exclaimed, “We have been fooled by Old Sakka,” and started up in pursuit. Mātali the charioteer brought up the chariot called Chariot of Victory and stopped by the way. Thereupon Sakka assisted his bride to mount and set out for the City of the Gods. Now when they reached the Forest of the Silk-cotton Trees, the Garuḍa fledglings, hearing the sound of the chariot and fearing they would be crushed to death, cried out.*";
P_HTM[1037]="***When Sakka heard their cries, he asked Mātali, “What are they that are crying?” “Garuḍa birds, Sire,” “Why are they crying?” “They hear the sound of the chariot and fear they will be crushed to death.” “Let not so numerous a host perish, crushed by the impact of the chariot, because of me alone. Cause the chariot to turn back.” Thereupon Mātali gave the sign with the lash to the thousand Sindh horses and caused the chariot to turn back.*";
P_HTM[1038]="***When the Asuras saw that the chariot had turned back, they said, “Old Sakka started out in flight from the city of the Asuras, but has just caused his chariot to turn back. Doubtless he has received reënforcements.” And turning back, the Asuras entered the city of the Asuras by the same road by which they had come out and nevermore lifted up their heads. Sakka bore the Asura maiden Wellborn to the City of the Gods and installed her as the chief of twenty-five million celestial nymphs.*";
P_HTM[1039]="***One day Wellborn asked Sakka for a boon, saying, “Great king, in this World of the Gods I have neither mother nor father nor brother nor sister; therefore pray take me with you wherever you go.” “Very well,” replied Sakka, promising to do for her as she had asked. Thenceforth, when the tree that is called Pied Trumpet-flower blooms, the Asuras cry out, “Now is the time when our heavenly Coral-tree blooms,” and straightway they sally forth to attack Sakka. Therefore Sakka posts a guard to defend the Nāgas in the sea below, and likewise affords protection to the Supaṇṇas and the Kumbhaṇḍas and the Yakkhas, and likewise to the Four Great Kings. And over all, for the purpose of averting disaster, he places before the gates of the City of the Gods images of Indra bearing the thunderbolt in his hands. When the Asuras, after defeating the Nāgas and the other supernatural beings approach the City of the Gods and see the images of Indra, they cry out, “Sakka has made a sally,” and flee away. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[1040]="***“Thus, Mahāli, Prince Magha adopted the way of Heedfulness. Because he was so heedful, he obtained such sovereignty so exalted and came to rule over the two Worlds of the Gods. Heedfulness is praised by the Buddhas and by others likewise. For it is through Heedfulness that all attain the Higher Attainments, both those that are of this world and those that transcend this world.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1045]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain monk.*";
P_HTM[1046]="***The story goes that this monk obtained from the Teacher a Subject of Meditation leading to Arahatship and retired to the forest. Although he strove and struggled with might and main, he was unable to attain Arahatship. Thereupon he said to himself, “I will ask the Teacher to give me a Subject of Meditation better suited to my needs.” So he departed from his place of residence and set out to return to the Teacher. On the way he saw a great forest fire raging. Accordingly he climbed up to the top of a bald mountain and sat down. As he watched the fire consume the forest, he concentrated his mind on the following thought, “Even as this fire advances, consuming all obstacles both great and small, so also ought I to advance, consuming all obstacles both great and small by the Fire of Knowledge of the Noble Path.”*";
P_HTM[1047]="***The Teacher, even as he sat in his Perfumed Chamber, became aware of the course of his thoughts and spoke as follows, “Monk, this is precisely true. Even as fire consumes all obstacles both great and small, so also is it necessary with the Fire of Knowledge to consume and utterly destroy all Attachments both small and great which arise within these living beings.” And sending forth a luminous image of himself, present, as it were, sitting face to face with that monk, he pronounced the following Apparition-Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1048]="***31. A monk who delights in heedfulness and views heedlessness with fear*";
P_HTM[1049]="***Advances like a fire, consuming attachments both small and great.*";
P_HTM[1050]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza that monk, even as he sat there, consumed all the Attachments and attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.

P_HTM[1055]="***For a youth of station, born and reared in a certain market-town not far from Sāvatthi, retired from the world and became a monk in the Religion of the Teacher. On making his full profession, he became known as Tissa of the Market-town, or Nigama Tissa. He acquired the reputation of being frugal, contented, pure, resolute. He always made his rounds for alms in the village where his relatives resided. Although, in the neighboring city of Sāvatthi, Anāthapiṇḍika and other disciples were bestowing abundant offerings and Pasenadi Kosala was bestowing gifts beyond compare, he never went to Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1056]="***One day the monks began to talk about him and said to the Teacher, “This monk Nigama Tissa, busy and active, lives in intimate association with his kinsfolk. Although Anāthapiṇḍika and other disciples are bestowing abundant offerings and Pasenadi Kosala is bestowing Gifts beyond Compare, he never comes to Sāvatthi.” The Teacher had Nigama Tissa summoned and asked him, “Monk, is the report true that you are doing thus and so?” “Reverend Sir,” replied Tissa, “it is not true that I live in intimate association with my relatives. I receive from these folk only so much food as I can eat. But after receiving so much food, whether coarse or fine, as is necessary to support me, I do not return to the monastery, thinking, ‘Why seek food?’ I do not live in intimate association with my relatives, Reverend Sir.” The Teacher, knowing the disposition of the monk, applauded him, saying, “Well done, well done, monk!” and then addressed him as follows, “It is not at all strange, monk, that after obtaining such a Teacher as I, you should be frugal. For frugality is my disposition and my habit.” And in response to a request of the monks he related the following*";
P_HTM[1057]="***9 a. Story of the Past: Sakka and the parrot*";
P_HTM[1058]="***Once upon a time several thousand parrots lived in a certain grove of fig-trees in the Himālaya country on the bank of the Ganges. One of them, the king-parrot, when the fruits of the tree in which he lived had withered away, ate whatever he found remaining, whether shoot or leaf or bark, drank water from the Ganges, and being very happy and contented, remained where he was. In fact he was so very happy and contented that the Abode of Sakka began to quake. Sakka considered the cause, and seeing the parrot, determined to put him to the test. Accordingly he employed his supernatural power and withered up the tree. Straightway the tree became a mere stump, full of holes and cracks. When the wind beat upon it, there came forth from the tree a hollow sound, and out of the holes and cracks came forth dust. The parrot ate the dust, drank water from the Ganges, and going nowhere else, remained perched on the top of the fig-tree, recking naught of wind and sun.*";
P_HTM[1059]="***When Sakka observed how very happy and contented the parrot was, he said to himself, “I will go to him, let him talk of the virtue of friendship, grant him his heart’s desire, and cause the fig-tree to bear ambrosial fruit.” Accordingly Sakka assumed the form of a royal goose, and preceded by Wellborn in the form of an Asura nymph, went to the grove of fig-trees, alighted on the branch of a certain tree not far off, and entered into conversation with the parrot by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1060]="***There are trees with green leaves, trees aplenty with abundant fruit.*";
P_HTM[1061]="***Why does the parrot’s heart delight in a tree that is withered and hollow?*";
P_HTM[1062]="***(The entire Jātaka is here to be related in detail, just as it occurs in the tenth Nipāta. The occasion there is different from what it is here, but everything else is the same.) When the Teacher had given this religious instruction, he said, “At that time Sakka was Ānanda, and the parrot-king was I myself. Thus, monks, contentment is my disposition and my habit. It is, therefore, not at all strange that my son Nigamavāsī Tissa, because he was so happy and contented, obtained me for his teacher. Such a monk, because he has attained the Paths and the Fruits, is not liable to fall away; nay rather he is nigh even unto Nibbāna.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1069]="***Once upon a time, by reason of attachment to the Three Evil Thoughts, Lust, Hatred, Delusion, Elder Meghiya was unable to practice Exertion in this mango-grove and returned to the Teacher. The Teacher addressed him as follows, “Meghiya, you committed a grievous fault. I asked you to remain, saying to you, ‘I am now alone, Meghiya. Just wait until some other monk appears.’ But despite my request, you went your way. A monk should never leave me alone and go his way when I ask him to remain. A monk should never be controlled thus by his thoughts. As for thoughts, they are flighty, and a man ought always to keep them under his own control.” So saying, the Teacher pronounced the two following Stanzas,*";

P_HTM[1079]="***In the country of the king of the Kosalans, it appears, at the foot of a mountain, was a certain thickly settled village named Mātika. Now one day sixty monks who had received from the Teacher a Subject of Meditation leading to Arahatship came to this village and entered it for alms. Now the headman of this village was a man named Mātika. When Mātika’s mother saw the monks, she provided them with seats, served them with rice-porridge flavored with all manner of choice flavors, and asked them, “Reverend Sirs, where do you desire to go?” “To some pleasant place, great lay disciple.” Knowing that the monks were seeking a place of residence for the season of the rains, she flung herself at their feet and said to them, “If the noble monks will reside here during these three months, I will take upon myself the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts and will perform Fast-day duties.” The monks consented, thinking to themselves, “With her assistance we shall be free from anxiety on the score of food and shall be able to effect Escape from Existence.”*";
P_HTM[1080]="***Mātika’s mother superintended the erection of a monastery to serve as their place of residence, presented it to them, and the monks took up their residence there. On a certain day they met together and admonished each other as follows, “Brethren, it behooves us not to live the life of Heedlessness, for before us stand the Eight Great Hells with gates wide open, even as our own houses. Now we have come hither thus, having received a Subject of Meditation from the living Buddha. And the favor of the Buddhas cannot be won by a deceitful person, even though he walk in their very footsteps. Only by doing the will of the Buddhas can their favor be won. Therefore be Heedful. Two monks may neither stand nor sit in any one place. In the evening we shall meet together to wait upon the Elder, and early in the morning we shall meet together when it is time to go the rounds for alms. At other times two of us must never be together. If, however, a monk be taken sick, let him come to the monastery court and strike a bell. At the signal given by the stroke on the bell, we will come together and provide a remedy for him.” Having made this agreement, they entered upon residence.*";
P_HTM[1081]="***One day, while the monks were in residence, that female lay disciple took ghee, molasses, and other kinds of food and at eventide, accompanied by a retinue of slaves and servants, went to the monastery. Seeing no monks, she asked some men, “Where have the noble monks gone?” “My lady, they must be sitting in their own respective night-quarters and day-quarters.” “What must I do in order to see them?” Men who knew about the agreement made by the Congregation of Monks said, “If you strike the bell, my lady, they will assemble.” So she struck the bell. When the monks heard the sound of the bell, they thought to themselves, “Someone must be sick.” And coming forth from their several quarters, they assembled in the monastery court. No two monks came by the same path.*";
P_HTM[1082]="***When the female lay disciple saw them approach one at a time, each from his own quarters, she thought to herself, “My sons must have had a quarrel with each other.” So, after paying obeisance to the Congregation of Monks, she asked them, “Have you had a quarrel, Reverend Sirs?” “No indeed, great lay disciple.” “If, Reverend Sirs, there is no quarrel among you, how is it that, whereas in coming to our house you came all together, to-day you do not approach in this manner, but instead approach one at a time, each from his own quarters?” “Great lay disciple, we were sitting each in his own cell, engaged in the practice of meditation.” “What do you mean, Reverend Sirs, by this expression, ‘practice of meditation’?” “We rehearse the Thirty-two Constituent Parts of the Body, and thus obtain a clear conception of the decay and death inherent in the body, great lay disciple.” “But, Reverend Sirs, are you alone permitted to rehearse the Thirty-two Constituent Parts of the Body, and thus obtain a clear conception of the decay and death inherent in the body; or are we also permitted to do this?” “This practice is forbidden to none, great lay disciple.” “Well then, teach me also the Thirty-two Constituent Parts of the Body and show me how to obtain a clear conception of the decay and death inherent in the body.” “Very well, lay disciple,” said the monks, “learn them.” So saying, they taught her all. She began at once to rehearse the Thirty-two Constituent Parts of the Body, striving thereby to obtain for herself a clear conception of the decay and death inherent in the body. So successful was she that even in advance of those monks she attained the Three Paths and the Three Fruits, and by the same Paths won the Four Supernatural Powers and the Higher Faculties.*";
P_HTM[1083]="***Arising from the bliss of the Paths and the Fruits, she looked with Supernatural Vision and considered within herself, “At what time did my sons attain this state?” Immediately she became aware of the following, “All these monks are still in the bondage of Lust, Hatred, Delusion. They have not yet, by the practice of Ecstatic Meditation, induced Spiritual Insight.” Then she pondered, “Do my sons possess the dispositions requisite for the attainment of Arahatship or do they not?” She perceived, “They do.” Then she pondered, “Do they possess suitable lodgings or do they not?” Immediately she perceived that they did. Then she pondered, “Have they proper companions or have they not?” Immediately she perceived that they had. Finally she pondered the question, “Do they receive proper food or do they not?” She perceived, “They do not receive proper food.”*";
P_HTM[1084]="***From that time on she provided them with various kinds of rice-porridge and with all manner of hard food and with soft food flavored with various choice flavors. And seating the monks in her house, she offered them Water of Donation and presented the food to them, saying, “Reverend Sirs, take and eat whatever you desire.” As the result of the wholesome food they received, their minds became tranquil; and as the result of tranquillity of mind, they developed Spiritual Insight and attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Powers. Then the thought occurred to them, “The great female lay disciple has indeed been our support. Had we not received wholesome food, we should never have attained the Paths and the Fruits. As soon as we have completed our residence and celebrated the Terminal Festival, let us go visit the Teacher.” Accordingly they took leave of the great female lay disciple, saying, “Lay disciple, we desire to see the Teacher.” “Very well, noble sirs,” said she. So she accompanied them on their journey a little way, and then, saying, “Look in on us again, Reverend Sirs,” and many other pleasant words, she returned to her house.*";
P_HTM[1085]="***When those monks arrived at Sāvatthi, they paid obeisance to the Teacher and sat down respectfully on one side. The Teacher said to them, “Monks, you have evidently fared well, had plenty to eat, and not been troubled on the score of food.” The monks replied, “We have indeed fared well, Reverend Sir, had plenty to eat, and by no means been troubled on the score of food. For a certain female lay disciple, the Mother of Mātika, knew the course of our thoughts, insomuch that the moment we thought, ‘Oh that she would prepare such and such food for us!’ she prepared the very food we thought of and gave to us.” Thus did they recite her praises.*";
P_HTM[1086]="***A certain monk, who heard his brethren praise the virtues of their hostess, conceived a desire to go there. So obtaining a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher, he took leave of the Teacher, saying, “Reverend Sir, I intend to go to that village.” And departing from Jetavana, he arrived in due course at that village and entered the monastery. On the very day he entered the monastery he thought to himself, “I have heard it said that this female lay disciple knows every thought that passes through the mind of another. Now I have been wearied by my journey and shall not be able to sweep the monastery. Oh that she would send a man to make ready the monastery for me!” The female lay disciple, sitting in her house, pondering within herself, became aware of this fact and sent a man thither, saying to him, “Go make ready the monastery and turn it over to him.” The man went and swept the monastery and turned it over to him. Then the monk, desiring to have water to drink, thought to himself, “Oh that she would send me some sweetened water!” Straightway the female lay disciple sent it. On the following day, early in the morning, he thought to himself, “Let her send me rice-porridge with plenty of butter, together with some dainty bits.” The female lay disciple straightway did so. After he had finished drinking the porridge, he thought to himself, “Oh that she would send me such and such hard food!” The female lay disciple straightway sent this also to him.*";
P_HTM[1087]="***Then he thought to himself, “This female lay disciple has sent me every single thing I have thought of. I should like to see her. Oh that she would come to me in person, bringing with her soft food seasoned with various choice seasonings!” The female lay disciple thought to herself, “My son wishes to see me, desires me to go to him.” So procuring soft food, she went to the monastery and gave it to him. When he had eaten his meal, he asked her, “Lay disciple, your name is Mother of Mātika?” “Yes, dear son.” “You know the thoughts of another?” “Why do you ask me, dear son?” “You have done for me every single thing I have thought of; that is why I ask you.” “Many are the monks who know the thoughts of another, dear son.” “I am not asking anyone else; I am asking you, lay disciple.” Even under these circumstances the female lay disciple avoided saying, “I know the thoughts of another,” and said instead, “Those who know not the thoughts of another do thus, my son.”*";
P_HTM[1088]="***Thereupon the monk thought to himself, “I am in a most embarrassing position. They that are unconverted entertain both noble and ignoble thoughts. Were I to entertain a single sinful thought, she would doubtless seize me by the topknot, bag and baggage, as she would seize a thief, and do me harm. Therefore I had best run away from here.” So he said to the female lay disciple, “Lay disciple, I intend to go away.” “Where are you going, noble sir?” “To the Teacher, lay disciple.” “Reside here for a while, Reverend Sir.” “I can no longer reside here, lay disciple. I must positively go away.” With these words he departed and went to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1089]="***The Teacher asked him, “Monk, are you no longer residing there?” “No, Reverend Sir, I cannot reside there any longer.” “For what reason, monk?” “Reverend Sir, that female lay disciple knows every single thought that passes through my mind. It occurred to me, ‘They that are unconverted entertain both noble and ignoble thoughts. Were I to entertain a single sinful thought, she would doubtless seize me by the topknot, bag and baggage, as she would seize a thief, and do me harm.’ That is why I have returned.” “Monk, that is the very place where you ought to reside.” “I cannot, Reverend Sir, I will not reside there any longer.” “Well then, monk, can you guard just one thing?” “What do you mean, Reverend Sir?” “Guard your thoughts alone, for thoughts are hard to guard. Restrain your thoughts alone. Do not concern yourself with aught else, for thoughts are unruly.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1090]="***35. Thoughts are unruly and flighty, and flit and flutter wherever they list.*";
P_HTM[1091]="***It is a good thing to tame the thoughts; tamed thoughts bring happiness.*";
P_HTM[1092]="***When the Teacher had admonished that monk, he dismissed him, saying, “Go, monk, concern yourself with nothing else. Resume residence in that same place.” And that monk, after being admonished by the Teacher, went to that same place and concerned himself with nothing other than his thoughts. The great female lay disciple looked with Supernatural Vision. Seeing the Elder, she determined by her own knowledge alone the following fact, “My son has now gained a Teacher who gives admonition and has returned once more.” And forthwith she prepared wholesome food and gave it to him. Once having received wholesome food, in but a few days the Elder attained Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[1093]="***As the Elder passed his days in the enjoyment of the bliss of the Paths and the Fruits, he thought to himself, “The great female lay disciple has indeed been a support to me. By her assistance I have gained Release from Existence.” And he considered within himself, “Has she been a support to me in my present state of existence only, or has she been a support to me in other states of existence also, as I have passed from one state of existence to another in the round of existences?” With this thought in mind he recalled a hundred states of existence less one. Now in a hundred states of existence less one that female lay disciple had been his wife, and her affections had been set on other men, and she had caused him to be deprived of life. When, therefore, the Elder beheld the huge pile of demerit she had accumulated, he thought to himself, “Oh, what wicked deeds this female lay disciple has committed!”*";
P_HTM[1094]="***The great female lay disciple also sat in her house, considering within herself the following thought, “Has my son reached the goal of the religious life?” Perceiving that he had attained Arahatship, she continued her reflections as follows, “When my son attained Arahatship, he thought to himself, ‘This female lay disciple has indeed been a powerful support to me.’ Then he considered within himself, ‘Has she been a support to me in previous states of existence also or has she not?’ With this thought in mind he recalled a hundred states of existence less one. Now in a hundred states of existence less one I conspired with other men and deprived him of life. When, therefore, he beheld the huge pile of demerit I thus accumulated, he thought to himself, ‘Oh, what wicked deeds this female lay disciple has committed!’ Is it not possible that, as I have passed from one state of existence to another in the round of existences, I have rendered assistance to him?”*";
P_HTM[1095]="***Considering the matter further, she called up before her mind her hundredth state of existence and became aware of the following, “In my hundredth state of existence I was his wife. On a certain occasion, when I might have deprived him of life, I spared his life. I have indeed rendered great assistance to my son.” And still remaining seated in her house, she said, “Discern further and consider the matter.” By the power of Supernatural Audition the monk immediately heard what she said. Discerning further, he called up before his mind his hundredth state of existence and perceived that in that state of existence she had spared his life. Filled with joy, he thought to himself, “This female lay disciple has indeed rendered great assistance to me.” Then and there, reciting the questions relating to the Four Paths and Fruits, he passed into that form of Nibbāna in which no trace of the Elements of Being remains.*";

P_HTM[1099]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain discontented monk.*";
P_HTM[1100]="***We are told that while the Teacher was in residence at Sāvatthi, a certain treasurer’s son approached an Elder who resorted to his house for alms and said to him, “Reverend Sir, I desire to obtain Release from Suffering. Tell me some way by which I can obtain Release from Suffering.” The Elder replied, “Peace be unto you, brother. If you desire Release from Suffering, give ticket-food, give fortnightly food, give lodging during the season of the rains, give bowls and robes and the other Requisites. Divide your possessions into three parts: with one portion carry on your business; with another portion support son and wife; dispense the third portion in alms in the Religion of the Buddha.”*";
P_HTM[1101]="***“Very well, Reverend Sir,” said the treasurer’s son, and did all in the prescribed order. Having done all, he returned to the Elder and asked him, “Reverend Sir, is there anything else I ought to do?” “Brother, take upon yourself the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts.” The treasurer’s son did so, and then asked whether there was anything else he ought to do. “Yes,” replied the Elder, “take upon yourself the Ten Precepts.” “Very well, Reverend Sir,” said the treasurer’s son, and took upon himself the Ten Precepts. Because the treasurer’s son had in this manner performed works of merit, one after another (anupubbena), he came to be called Anupubba. Again he asked the Elder, “Reverend Sir, is there anything else I ought to do?” The Elder replied, “Yes, become a monk.” The treasurer’s son immediately retired from the world and became a monk.*";
P_HTM[1102]="***Now he had a teacher who was versed in the Abhidhamma and a preceptor who was versed in the Vinaya. After he had made his full profession, whenever he approached his teacher, the latter repeated questions found in the Abhidhamma, “In the Religion of the Buddha it is lawful to do this, it is unlawful to do that.” And whenever he approached his preceptor, the latter repeated questions found in the Vinaya, “In the Religion of the Buddha it is lawful to do this, it is unlawful to do that; this is proper, this is improper.” After a time he thought to himself, “Oh, what a wearisome task this is! I became a monk in order to obtain Release from Suffering, but here there is not even room for me to stretch out my hands. It is possible, however, to obtain Release from Suffering, even if one live the house-life. I had best become a householder once more.”*";
P_HTM[1103]="***From that time forth, discontented and dissatisfied, he rehearsed the Thirty-two Constituent Parts of the Body no more and received instruction no more. He became emaciated, his skin shriveled up, veins stood out all over his body, weariness oppressed him, and his body was covered with scabs. The probationers and novices asked him, “Brother, how is it that wherever you stand, wherever you sit, you are sick of the jaundice, emaciated, shriveled up, your body covered with scabs? What have you done?” “Brethren, I am discontented.” “Why?” He told them his story, and they told his teacher and his preceptor, and his teacher and his preceptor took him with them to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1104]="***Said the Teacher, “Monks, why have you come?” “Reverend Sir, this monk is dissatisfied in your Religion.” “Monk, is what they say true?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Why are you dissatisfied?” “Reverend Sir, I became a monk in order to obtain Release from Suffering. My teacher has recited passages from the Abhidhamma, and my preceptor has recited passages from the Vinaya. Reverend Sir, I have come to the following conclusion, ‘Here there is not even room for me to stretch out my hands. It is possible for me to obtain Release from Suffering as a householder. I will therefore become a householder.’ ” “Monk, if you can guard one thing, it will not be necessary for you to guard the rest.” “What is that, Reverend Sir?” “Can you guard your thoughts?” “I can, Reverend Sir.” “Well then, guard your thoughts alone.” Having given this admonition, the Teacher pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1110]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Saṅgharakkhita.*";
P_HTM[1111]="***The story goes that a certain youth of respectable family living at Sāvatthi, after hearing a sermon of the Teacher, retired from the world, was received into the Order, made his full profession, and in but a few days attained Arahatship. He was known as Elder Saṅgharakkhita. When his youngest sister gave birth to a son, she named him after the Elder, and thus he came to be known as Nephew Saṅgharakkhita. When Nephew Saṅgharakkhita came of age, he entered the Order under the Elder, and after making his full profession, entered upon residence for the period of the rains at a certain village monastery. Receiving two sets of robes such as are worn by monks during the period of the rains, one seven cubits long, the other eight cubits long, he decided to present the robe eight cubits long to his preceptor and to keep the robe seven cubits long for himself. When he had completed residence, he set out for the purpose of seeing his preceptor and journeyed from place to place, receiving alms by the way.*";
P_HTM[1112]="***He arrived at the monastery before the Elder arrived. Entering the monastery, he swept the Elder’s day-quarters, set out water for bathing the feet, prepared a seat, and then sat down, watching the road by which the Elder would approach. When he saw the Elder approach, he advanced to meet him, took his bowl and robe, seated the Elder with the words, “Pray be seated, Reverend Sir,” took a palm-leaf fan and fanned him, gave him water to drink, and bathed his feet. Finally he brought forth the robe, laid it at the Elder’s feet, and said, “Reverend Sir, pray wear this robe.” Having so done, he resumed fanning him. Said the Elder to the nephew, “Saṅgharakkhita, I have a complete set of robes; you wear this robe yourself.” “Reverend Sir, from the moment I received this robe I set my heart on giving it to you alone. Pray make use of it.” “Never mind, Saṅgharakkhita, my set of robes is complete; you wear this robe yourself.” “Reverend Sir, pray do not refuse the robe, for if you wear it, great will be the fruit I shall receive thereby.”*";
P_HTM[1113]="***Although the younger monk repeated his request several times, the Elder refused to accept the present of the robe. So, as the younger monk stood there fanning the Elder, he thought to himself, “While the Elder was a layman, I stood in the relation of nephew to him. Since he has been a monk, I have been his fellow-resident. But in spite of this he is not willing as my preceptor to share my possessions. If he is not willing to share my possessions with me, why should I longer remain a monk? I will become a householder once more.” Then the following thought occurred to him, “It is a hard thing to live the house-life. Suppose I become a householder once more; how shall I gain a living?” Finally the following thought occurred to him,*";
P_HTM[1114]="***“I will sell this robe eight cubits long and buy me a she-goat. Now she-goats are very prolific, and as fast as the she-goat brings forth young, I will sell them, and in this way accumulate some capital. As soon as I have accumulated some capital, I will fetch me a wife. My wife will bear me a son, and I will name him after my uncle. I will put my son in a go-cart, and taking son and wife with me, will go to pay my respects to my uncle. As I journey by the way, I will say to my wife, ‘Just bring me my son; I wish to carry him.’ She will reply, ‘Why should you carry this boy? Come, push this go-cart.’ So saying, she will take the boy in her arms, thinking to herself, ‘I will carry him myself.’ But lacking the necessary strength to carry him, she will let him fall in the path of the wheels, and the go-cart will run over him. Then I will say to her, ‘You would not even give me my own son to carry, although you were not strong enough to carry him yourself. You have ruined me.’ So saying, I will bring down my stick on her back.”*";
P_HTM[1115]="***Thus pondered the younger monk as he stood fanning the Elder. As he concluded his reflections, he swung his palm-leaf fan and brought it down on the head of the Elder. The Elder considered within himself, “Why did Saṅgharakkhita strike me on the head?” Immediately becoming aware of every single thought that had passed through the mind of his nephew, he said to him, “Saṅgharakkhita, you did not succeed in hitting the woman; but what has an old Elder done to deserve a beating?” The younger monk thought to himself, “Oh, I am ruined! My preceptor, it appears, knows every thought that has passed through my mind. What have I to do with the life of a monk any longer?” Straightway he threw his fan away and started to run off. But the probationers and novices ran after him, caught him, and led him to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1116]="***When the Teacher saw those monks, he asked them, “Monks, why have you come here? Have you captured a monk?” “Yes, Reverend Sir. This probationer became discontented and ran away, but we captured him and have brought him to you.” “Monk, is what they say true?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Monk, why did you commit so grievous a fault? Are you not the son of a Buddha the powers of whose will are ever active? And once having retired from the world in the Religion of a Buddha like me, though you failed through self-conquest to win for yourself the title of one who has attained the Fruit of Conversion or the Fruit of the Second Path or the Fruit of the Third Path or Arahatship, yet for all that, why did you commit so grievous a fault as this?”*";
P_HTM[1117]="***“I am discontented, Reverend Sir.” “Why are you discontented?” In reply the younger monk related the whole story of his experiences, from the day he received the robes worn by monks in residence to the moment when he struck the Elder on the head with his palm-leaf fan. “Reverend Sir,” said he, “that is why I ran away.” Said the Teacher, “Come, monk; be not disturbed. The mind has a way of dwelling on subjects that are far off. One should strive to free it from the bonds of Lust, Hatred, and Delusion.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1130]="***The story goes that a certain youth of respectable family, living at Sāvatthi, went into the forest to look for an ox that was lost. When it was midday, he saw the ox and released the herds, and being oppressed by hunger and thirst, thought to himself, “I can surely get something to eat from the noble monks.” So he entered the monastery, went to the monks, bowed to them, and stood respectfully on one side. Now at that time the food which remained over and above to the monks who had eaten lay in the vessel used for refuse. When the monks saw that youth, exhausted by hunger as he was, they said to him, “Here is food; take and eat it.” (When a Buddha is living in the world, there is always a plentiful supply of rice-porridge, together with various sauces and curries.) So the youth took and ate as much food as he needed drank water, washed his hands, and then bowed to the monks and asked them, “Reverend Sirs, did you go to some house by invitation to-day?” “No, lay disciple; monks always receive food in this way.”*";
P_HTM[1131]="***The youth thought to himself, “No matter how busy and active we may be, though we work continually both by night and by day, we never get rice-porridge so deliciously seasoned. But these monks, according to their own statement, eat it continually. Why should I remain a layman any longer? I will become a monk.” Accordingly he approached the monks and asked to be received into the Order. The monks said to him, “Very well, lay disciple,” and received him into the Order. After making his full profession, he performed all the various major and minor duties; and in but a few days, sharing in the rich offerings which accrue to the Buddhas, he became fat and well-liking.*";
P_HTM[1132]="***Then he thought to himself, “Why should I live on food obtained by making alms-pilgrimages? I will become a layman once more.” So back he went and entered his house. After working in his house for only a few days, his body languished. Thereupon he said to himself, “Why should I endure this suffering any longer? I will become a monk.” So back he went and became a monk again. But after spending a few days as a monk, becoming discontented once more, off he went again. Now when he was a monk, he was a helper of the other monks. After a few days he became discontented again and said to himself, “Why should I live the life of a layman any longer? I will become a monk.” So saying, he went to the monks, bowed, and asked to be received into the Order. Because he had helped them, the monks received him into the Order once more. In this manner he entered the Order and left it again six times in succession. The monks said to themselves, “This man lives under the sway of his thoughts.” So they gave him the name Thought-controlled, Elder Cittahattha.*";
P_HTM[1133]="***As he was thus going back and forth, his wife became pregnant. The seventh time he returned from the forest with his farming implements he went to the house, put his implements away, and entered his own room, saying to himself, “I will put on my yellow robe again.” Now his wife happened to be abed and asleep at the time. Her undergarment had fallen off, saliva was flowing from her mouth, she was snoring, her mouth was wide open; she appeared to him like a swollen corpse. Grasping the thought, “All that is in this world is transitory, is involved in suffering,” he said to himself, “To think that because of her, all the time I have been a monk, I have been unable to continue steadfast in the monastic life!” Straightway taking his yellow robe by the hem, he ran out of the house, binding the robe about his belly as he ran.*";
P_HTM[1134]="***Now his mother-in-law lived in the same house with him. When she saw him departing in this wise, she said to herself, “This renegade, who but this moment returned from the forest, is running from the house, binding his yellow robe about him as he runs, and is making for the monastery. What does this mean?” Entering the house and seeing her daughter asleep, she knew at once, “It was because he saw her asleep that he became disgusted and went away.” So she shook her daughter and said to her, “Rise, hag. Your husband saw you asleep, became disgusted, and went away. You will have him no more for your husband henceforth.” “Begone, mother. What matters it whether he has gone or not? He will be back again in but a few days.”*";
P_HTM[1135]="***As Cittahattha proceeded on his way, repeating the words, “All that is in this world is transitory, is involved in suffering,” he obtained the Fruit of Conversion. Continuing his journey, he went to the monks, bowed to them, and asked to be received into the Order. “No,” said the monks, “we cannot receive you into the Order. Why should you become a monk? Your head is like a grindstone.” “Reverend Sirs, receive me into the Order just this once.” Because he had helped them, they received him into the Order. After a few days he attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[1136]="***Thereupon they said to him, “Brother Cittahattha, doubtless you alone will decide when it is time for you to go away again; you have tarried here a long while this time.” “Reverend Sirs, when I was attached to the world, I went away; but now I have put away attachment to the world; I have no longer any desire to go away.” The monks went to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, we said such and such to this monk, and he said such and such to us in reply. He utters falsehood, says what is not true.” The Teacher replied, “Yes, monks, when my son’s mind was unsteady, when he knew not the Good Law, then he went and came. But now he has renounced both good and evil.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1137]="***38. He whose heart abides not steadfast.*";

P_HTM[1144]="***He who is vigilant, – such a man has nothing to fear.*";
P_HTM[1145]="***Now one day the monks began a discussion: “Brethren, grievous indeed are these evil passions of ours. So noble a youth as this, predestined to attain Arahatship, swayed by evil passions, became a monk seven times, and seven times returned to the world.” The Teacher heard them discussing this matter, went at an opportune moment, entered the Hall of Truth, sat down in the Seat of the Buddha, and asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “It is precisely so, monks. The evil passions are indeed grievous. If they could take on material forms, so that they could be put away somewhere, a World would be too restricted for them and the Heaven of Brahmā too low for them. There would not be room for them anywhere. They bewilder even one like me, possessed of wisdom, a being of noble birth. Who can describe their effect on others? For in a previous state of existence even I, all because of half a pint-pot of seed-beans and a blunt spade, became a monk six times and returned to the world six times.” “When did that happen, Reverend Sir?” “Do you wish to hear about it, monks?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Well then, listen.” So saying, the Teacher related the following*";
P_HTM[1146]="***5 a. Story of the Past: Kuddāla and his spade*";
P_HTM[1147]="***Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta reigned at Benāres, there dwelt at Benāres a certain wise man named Spade Sage, Kuddāla. He became a monk of an heretical Order and dwelt for eight months in the Himālaya country. One night during the season of the rains, when the ground was wet, he thought to himself, “I have in my house half a pint-pot of seed-beans and a blunt spade; my seed-beans must not be lost.” So he returned to the world, tilled a certain plot of ground with his spade, planted that seed, and put a fence around it. When the beans were ripe, he pulled them up, and setting aside a pint-pot of beans for seed, he used the rest for food. Then he thought to himself, “Why should I live the life of a layman any longer? I will reside in the Himālaya country for eight months more as a monk.” So he departed from his house and became a monk once more. In this manner, all because of half a pint-pot of seed-beans and a blunt spade, he became a monk seven times, and seven times returned to the world.*";
P_HTM[1148]="***The seventh time he thought to himself, “Seven times I have returned to the world after becoming a monk, all because of this blunt spade. I will throw it away somewhere.” So he went to the bank of the Ganges, carrying the pint-pot of seed-beans and the blunt spade with him. As he stood on the bank of the river, he thought to himself, “If I see the spot where these things fall, I may be tempted to descend into the river and fish them out. Therefore I will take care to throw them in such a way that I shall not see where they fall.” Accordingly he wrapped the pint-pot of seeds in a cloth, tied the cloth to the handle of the spade, and grasped the spade by the tip of the handle. And standing there on the bank of the Ganges, he closed his eyes, whirled the spade three times round over his head, and flung it into the Ganges. Then he faced about so that he might not see where the spade fell and cried three times with a loud voice, “I have conquered! I have conquered!”*";
P_HTM[1149]="***Just at that moment the king of Benāres, who had returned from suppressing disorder on his frontier and pitched camp on the bank of the river and descended into the stream to bathe, heard that cry. Now the cry, “I have conquered!” is a cry kings do not like to hear. The king of Benāres therefore went to Cittahattha and said, “I have but just put my enemy under my feet and have returned with the thought in my mind, ‘I have conquered!’ But you have just cried out, ‘I have conquered! I have conquered!’ What do you mean by this?” Said Spade Sage, “You have conquered bandits that are without. The victory you have won will have to be won again. But I have conquered an enemy that is within, the bandit of desire. He will never conquer me again. Victory over him is the only true victory,” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1150]="***That victory is no true victory which must be won again;*";
P_HTM[1151]="***That victory is true victory which need not be won again.*";
P_HTM[1152]="***At that moment, gazing upon the Ganges and meditating upon the element of water. Spade Sage acquired Specific Attainment, whereupon he rose from the ground and sat cross-legged in the air. The king after hearing the religious instruction of the Great Being, paid obeisance to him, requested him to receive him as a monk, and became a monk, together with his entire force; his retinue extended for a distance of a league. Another king who was his neighbor, hearing that he had become a monk, thought to himself, “I will seize his kingdom,” and went thither, intending to do so. But when he saw that prosperous city empty, he thought to himself, “A king who would give up so beautiful a city to become a monk would certainly not become a monk to his own hindrance. I also ought to become a monk.” Therefore he went to where the Great Being was, paid obeisance to him, requested him to receive him as a monk, and became a monk, together with his retinue. In like manner seven kings in all became monks; their hermitage was seven leagues long; seven kings renounced their worldly possessions and became monks. Having won over all this numerous company, the Great Being lived the holy life and went to the Heaven of Brahmā. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[1153]="***When the Teacher had finished this lesson, he said, “Monks, at that time I was Spade Sage. Learn from this story how grievous the evil passions are.”*";

P_HTM[1156]="***One should attack Māra with the weapon of wisdom; one should stand guard over Māra when he is defeated; one should never rest.*";
P_HTM[1157]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to some monks who attained Insight.*";
P_HTM[1158]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, five hundred monks obtained from the Teacher a Subject of Meditation leading to Arahatship, and with the intention of devoting themselves to the practice of meditation, went a hundred leagues to a large village. When the inhabitants of the village saw them, they provided them with seats, served them with choice rice-porridge and other kinds of food, and asked them, “Reverend Sirs, where are you going?” The monks replied, “To some pleasant place.” Then said the inhabitants of the village, “Reverend Sirs, reside right here during these three months. Under your direction we will abide steadfast in the Refuges and will keep the Precepts.” The villagers, having obtained the consent of the monks, said, “Reverend Sirs, there is a large forest-grove not far from this place. Take up your residence there.” So saying, the villagers dismissed the monks, and the monks entered the forest.*";
P_HTM[1159]="***Thereupon virtuous spirits dwelling in that forest-grove thought, “A company of monks have come to this forest-grove. If, however, these monks dwell in this forest-grove, it will be improper for us longer to take son and wife, climb the trees, and live here.” Accordingly they came down from the trees, seated themselves on the ground, and reflected, “If the monks remain in this place to-night, they will surely leave to-morrow morning.” But on the following day also the monks, after making their rounds for alms in the village, returned again to that same forest-grove. Thereupon the spirits thought to themselves, “Someone must have invited the company of monks for to-morrow, and for this reason they have returned. To-day they will not depart, but to-morrow they will surely depart.” Reasoning in this way, they sat for a fortnight on the ground.*";
P_HTM[1160]="***Then they thought to themselves, “It is doubtless the intention of the monks to remain right here during these three months. But if they do remain here, it will be improper for us to take son and wife, climb the trees, and live here for three months. Moreover, it will greatly weary us to sit here on the ground. By what means can we best drive these monks away?” Accordingly in the night-quarters, in the day-quarters, and at the ends of the cloisters the spirits caused the monks to see bodiless heads and headless trunks and to hear the voices of demons. At the same time the monks were afflicted with sneezing and coughing and suffered from many other ailments besides. They said to each other, “Brother, what ails you?” “I am afflicted with sneezing. I am afflicted with coughing.” “Brethren, to-day, at the end of the cloister, I saw a bodiless head. Brethren, in the night-quarters I saw a headless trunk. Brethren, in the day-quarters I heard a demon’s voice. We ought by all means to leave this place; this is an unpleasant place for us. Let us go to the Teacher.”*";
P_HTM[1161]="***Accordingly they departed from the forest-grove, went in due course to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and sat down respectfully on one side. Said the Teacher to them, “Monks, were you unable to dwell in that place?” “Even so, Reverend Sir. While we dwelt there, such fearful objects as these presented themselves to our sight. The place was so unpleasant for us that we decided we must leave it. Therefore we have abandoned it and have returned to you.” “Monks, to that very place you ought to return.” “We cannot do so, Reverend Sir.” “Monks, when you went there the first time, you went without a weapon. Now you must take a weapon with you when you go.” “What kind of weapon, Reverend Sir?” Said the Teacher, “I will give you a weapon, and the weapon which I give you you are to take with you when you go.” Then he recited the entire Metta Sutta, beginning as follows, “This must he do who is skilled to seek his own spiritual good, once he has attained the Region of Tranquillity: he must be honest and upright and meek and mild and free from vaingloriousness.” Having recited this Sutta, he said, “Monks, recite this Sutta from the forest-grove, without the hermitage, and then you may enter within the hermitage.” With these instructions he dismissed them.*";
P_HTM[1162]="***They paid obeisance to the Teacher, started out, and in due course arrived at that forest-grove. Reciting the Sutta in unison without the hermitage, they entered the forest-grove. Thereupon the spirits residing throughout the forest-grove conceived friendly feelings in their hearts for the monks, came forth to meet them, asked the monks to let them take their bowls and robes, offered to rub their hands and feet, posted strong guards on all sides, and sat down together with them. Not a demon’s voice was heard. The hearts of those monks became tranquil. Sitting in their night-quarters and day-quarters they strove to attain Insight. Fixing in their minds the thought of the decay and death inherent in their bodies and reflecting upon the thought, “By reason of its fragile and unstable nature this body is like a potter’s vessel,” they developed Spiritual Insight.*";
P_HTM[1163]="***The Supremely Enlightened, even as he sat in the Perfumed Chamber, knowing that those monks had begun to develop Spiritual Insight, addressed them, “It is even so, monks. This body, by reason of its fragile and unstable nature, is precisely like a potter’s vessel.” So saying, he sent forth a luminous image of himself, and although a hundred leagues away, appearing to be seated face to face with them, present in visible form, diffusing six-colored rays of light, pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1168]="***Despised, with consciousness departed, like a useless log.*";
P_HTM[1169]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Elder Pūtigatta Tissa.*";
P_HTM[1170]="***A certain youth of station who lived at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher preach the Law, yielded the breast to religion, retired from the world, and after admission as a full member of the Order became known as Elder Tissa. As time went on, an eruption broke out on his body. At first appeared pustules no bigger than mustard-seeds, but as the disease progressed, they assumed successively the size of kidney-beans, chick-peas, jujube seeds, emblic myrobalans, and vilva fruits. Finally they burst open, and his whole body became covered with open sores. In this way he came to be called Elder Pūtigatta Tissa. After a time his bones began to disintegrate, and no one was willing to take care of him. His under and upper garments, which were stained with dried blood, looked like net-cakes. His fellow-residents, unable to care for him, cast him out, and he lay down on the ground without a protector.*";
P_HTM[1171]="***Now the Buddhas never fail to survey the world twice a day. At dawn they survey the world, looking from the rim of the world towards the Perfumed Chamber, taking cognizance of all they see. In the evening they survey the world, looking from the Perfumed Chamber and taking cognizance of all that is without. Now at this time the Elder Pūtigatta Tissa appeared within the net of the Exalted One’s knowledge. The Teacher, knowing that the monk Tissa was ripe for Arahatship, thought to himself, “This monk has been abandoned by his associates; at the present time he has no other refuge than me.” Accordingly the Teacher departed from the Perfumed Chamber, and pretending to be making the rounds of the monastery, went to the hall where the fire was kept. He washed the boiler, placed it on the brazier, waited in the fire-room for the water to boil, and when he knew it was hot, went and took hold of the end of the bed where that monk was lying.*";
P_HTM[1172]="***At that time the monks said to the Teacher, “Pray depart, Reverend Sir; we will carry him in for you.” So saying, they took up the bed and carried Tissa into the fire-room. The Teacher caused a measure to be brought and sprinkled hot water. He then caused the monks to take Tissa’s upper garment, wash it thoroughly in hot water, and lay it in the sunshine to dry. Then he went, and taking his stand near Tissa, moistened his body with hot water and rubbed and bathed him. At the end of his bath his upper garment was dry. The Teacher caused him to be clothed in his upper garment and caused his under garment to be washed thoroughly in hot water and laid in the sun to dry. As soon as the water had evaporated from his body, his under garment was dry. Thereupon Tissa put on one of the yellow robes as an under garment and the other as an upper garment, and with body refreshed and mind tranquil lay down on the bed. The Teacher took his stand at Tissa’s pillow and said to him, “Monk, consciousness will depart from you, your body will become useless and, like a log, will lie on the ground.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1173]="***41. In no long time this body will lie on the ground,*";
P_HTM[1174]="***Despised, with consciousness departed, like a useless log.*";
P_HTM[1175]="***At the conclusion of the lesson Elder Pūtigatta Tissa attained Arahatship and passed into Nibbāna. The Teacher performed the funeral rites over his body, and taking the relics, caused a shrine to be erected.*";
P_HTM[1176]="***The monks asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, where was Elder Pūtigatta Tissa reborn?” “He has passed into Nibbāna, monks.” “Reverend Sir, how did it happen that such a monk, predestined to attain Arahatship, came to have a diseased body? Why did his bones disintegrate? Through what deed in a former birth did he obtain the dispositions requisite for the attainment of Arahatship?” “Monks, all these things happened solely because of deeds he committed in a previous existence.” “But, Reverend Sir, what did he do?” “Well then, monks, listen.”*";
P_HTM[1177]="***7 a. Story of the Past: The cruel fowler*";
P_HTM[1178]="***In the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, Tissa was a fowler. He used to catch birds in large numbers, and most of these he served to royalty. Most of those he did not give to royalty he used to sell. Fearing that if he killed and kept the birds he did not sell, they would rot, and desiring to prevent his captive birds from taking flight, he used to break their leg-bones and wing-bones and lay them aside, piling them in a heap. On the following day he would sell them. When he had too many, he would have some cooked also for himself.*";
P_HTM[1179]="***One day, when well-flavored food had been cooked for him, a monk who was an Arahat stopped at the door of his house on his round for alms. When Tissa saw the Elder, he made his mind serene, and thought, “I have killed and eaten many living creatures. A noble Elder stands at my door, and an abundance of well-flavored food is in my house. I will therefore give him alms.” So he took the monk’s bowl and filled it, and having given him well-flavored food, saluted the monk with the Five Rests and said, “Reverend Sir, may I obtain the highest fruit of the Law you have seen.” Said the Elder, returning thanks, “So be it.” Monks, it was through the meritorious deed Tissa then did that this fruit accrued to him. It was because he broke the bones of birds that his members became diseased and his bones disintegrated. It was because he gave well-flavored food to the Arahat that he attained Arahatship.*";

P_HTM[1182]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence in the Kosala country with reference to Nanda the herdsman.*";
P_HTM[1183]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a herdsman named Nanda who tended his herd of cattle. Nanda was rich, possessed of abundant wealth, possessed of ample means of enjoyment. We are told that, as did Keniya the ascetic of the matted locks by retiring from the world, so did Nanda by tending herds and by managing the king’s revenue preserve his own wealth. Again and again Nanda, taking the five products of the cow, went to the house of Anāthapiṇḍika, beheld the Teacher, listened to the Law, and invited the Teacher to come to his own residence. For some time the Teacher waited for Nanda’s wisdom to ripen, and therefore refrained from going. But one day, making his round for alms, accompanied by a large company of monks, perceiving that his wisdom had ripened, he withdrew from the road and sat down under a certain tree near Nanda’s place of abode.*";
P_HTM[1184]="***Nanda went to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, greeted him in a friendly manner, invited the Teacher to accept his hospitality, and for seven days gave the Congregation of Monks the choicest of the five products of the cow. On the seventh day the Teacher, returning thanks, delivered in orderly sequence the discourse on almsgiving and other discourses. At the conclusion of the discourse Nanda the herdsman was established in the Fruit of Conversion. Thereupon he took the bowl of the Teacher and accompanied him on his way for a considerable distance. Then said the Teacher, “Halt, disciple.” Straightway Nanda obeyed the Teacher’s command, paid obeisance to him, and turned back.*";
P_HTM[1185]="***At that moment a hunter shot an arrow and killed Nanda. The monks saw this as they were returning, and went and said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, because of your coming here, Nanda the herdsman gave abundant gifts, accompanied you on your journey, and was killed as he returned. Had you not come, his death would not have occurred.” The Teacher replied, “Monks, whether I had gone or not, whether Nanda had gone to the four cardinal points or to the four intermediate points, he could not possibly have escaped from death. For what neither thieves nor enemies do, this a corrupt mind attached to falsehood does to living creatures here in the world.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1191]="***Thoughts well-directed could do this far better.*";
P_HTM[1192]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at the Jetavana in Sāvatthi with reference to the treasurer, Elder Soreyya. The story begins in the city of Soreyya and ends in the city of Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1193]="***While the Supremely Enlightened was in residence at Sāvatthi, the following incident took place in the city of Soreyya: A treasurer’s son named Soreyya, together with a certain intimate friend of his, sitting in a carriage, accompanied by a large retinue, drove out of the city to bathe. At that moment Elder Mahā Kaccāyana, intending to enter the city of Soreyya for alms, was putting on his mantle outside of the city gate. When the treasurer’s son Soreyya saw the golden-hued body of the Elder, he thought to himself, “Oh, that this Elder might become my wife! Else may the hue of my wife’s body become like the hue of his body!”*";
P_HTM[1194]="***The instant this thought passed through his mind Soreyya was transformed from a man into a woman. He descended from the carriage in embarrassment and took to flight. His attendants, not understanding what had taken place, said, “What does this mean? What does this mean?” Soreyya, thus transformed into a woman set out on the road to Takkasilā. His carriage-companion searched everywhere for him, but failed to find him. When all the members of the party had bathed, they returned home. They were asked, “Where is the treasurer’s son?” They replied, “We supposed that, after bathing, he must have returned home.” His mother and father searched everywhere for him, but failing to find him, wept and lamented. And concluding that he must be dead, they gave the funeral feast.*";
P_HTM[1195]="***Soreyya, now a woman, seeing a caravan leader bound for Takkasilā, followed close behind his wagon. Members of the caravan noticed her and said, “She keeps following close behind our wagon, but we do not know whose daughter she is.” Said she, “Masters, drive your own wagon. I will follow on foot.” Having continued her journey on foot for a considerable distance, she bribed her masters with the present of a seal-ring to make room for her in a certain wagon. The men of the caravan thought to themselves, “Our treasurer’s son, who lives in the city of Sāvatthi, has no wife. We will tell him about this woman, and he will give us a handsome present.” So when they reached Takkasilā, they went and said to him, “Master, we have brought you a jewel of a woman.” When the treasurer’s son heard this, he sent for her. Observing that she suited his age and was exceedingly beautiful, he fell in love with her and married her.*";
P_HTM[1196]="***(For there are no men who have not, at some time or other, been women; and no women who have not, at some time or other, been men. For example, men who have sinned with the wives of other men are after death tormented in Hell for hundreds of thousands of years, and upon resuming human estate are reborn as women during a hundred successive states of existence. For even the Elder Ānanda, who fulfilled the Perfections for a hundred thousand cycles of time and was a Noble Disciple, reborn as a blacksmith in a certain state of existence, as he passed from one state of existence to another in the round of existences, sinned with the wife of another man. As a result he suffered torment in Hell, and thereafter, because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted, he was obliged to spend fourteen existences as the wife of another man, and seven existences in addition, before the effect of his evil deed was completely exhausted. On the other hand women, by bestowing alms and performing other works of merit, by putting away desire to continue in existence longer as women, by forming the resolution, “May this work of merit of ours avail to procure for us rebirth as men,” obtain rebirth as men after death. Likewise wives who conduct themselves properly towards their husbands obtain rebirth as men. But this treasurer’s son, having unwisely set his thought on the Elder, was in that very existence transformed into a woman.)*";
P_HTM[1197]="***So the son of the treasurer of Soreyya, transformed into a woman, was married to the son of the treasurer of Takkasilā, and as a result of their living together, she conceived a child in her womb. When ten lunar months had elapsed, she gave birth to a son. When the latter was old enough to walk, she gave birth to a second son. Thus Soreyyā, who was the father of two sons born in the city of Soreyya, became the mother of two more sons born in the city of Takkasilā, making four sons in all.*";
P_HTM[1198]="***Just at this time the treasurer’s son who was Soreyya’s carriage-companion set out from the city of Soreyya with five hundred carts, and arriving at Takkasilā, entered town seated in his carriage. At that moment the woman Soreyyā stood at an open window on the topmost floor of her palace, looking down into the street. As soon as she saw him, she recognized him, and sending a slave-woman to him, she summoned him within, provided a seat for him in the great hall of the palace, and bestowed upon him the usual attentions and honors. Said the guest to the host, “My lady, I never saw you before, but you have been exceedingly kind to me. Do you know who I am?” “Yes, my lord, I know perfectly who you are. Do you not reside in the city of Soreyya?” “Yes, my lady.” Thereupon his host inquired after the health of her mother and father and former wife and sons. “They are very well indeed,” replied the visitor, and then queried, “Do you know them?” “Yes, my lord, I know them very well. And, my lord, they have a son. Where is he?”*";
P_HTM[1199]="***“My lady, I beg you not to speak of him. One day, seated in a carriage together, we drove out of the city to bathe, and all of a sudden he disappeared. None of us know where he went or whatever became of him. We searched everywhere for him, but failed to find him. Finally we told his mother and father, whereupon they wept and lamented and performed the rites for the dead.” “My lord, I am he.” “Go away, my lady. What are you saying? He was an intimate friend of mine, he was like a celestial youth, he was a man.” “Nevermind, my lord; I am he, all the same.” “What is the explanation of this?” inquired her visitor. “Do you remember seeing the noble Elder Mahā Kaccāyana that day?” inquired his host. “Yes, I remember seeing him.” “Well, when I looked upon the noble Elder Mahā Kaccāyana, I thought to myself, ‘Oh, that this Elder might become my wife! Else may the hue of my wife’s body become like the hue of his body!’ The instant this thought parsed through my mind I was transformed from a man into a woman. Well, my lord, I was so embarrassed that I was unable to speak to anyone. Therefore I took to flight and came here.” “Oh, it was very wrong for you to do what you did. Why did you not tell me? And did you beg the Elder’s pardon?” “No, my lord, I did not beg his pardon. But do you know where the Elder is?” “He resides near this very city.” “Were he to come here, my lord, I should like to give food in alms to my noble Elder.” “Very well, make provision for him immediately. I will prevail upon our noble Elder to pardon you.”*";
P_HTM[1200]="***So Soreyya’s former carriage-companion went to the place where the Elder resided, paid obeisance to him, sat down respectfully on one side, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, pray receive alms from me to-morrow.” The Elder replied, “Treasurer’s son, are you not a visitor here?” “Reverend Sir, pray do not ask me whether I am a visitor or not. Receive alms from me to-morrow.” The Elder accepted the invitation, and bounteous provisions were made ready for the Elder in the house. On the following day the Elder came and stood at the door of that house. The treasurer’s son provided him with a seat and served him with choice food. Then, taking that woman, he caused her to prostrate herself before the Elder’s feet and said, “Reverend Sir, pardon my friend.” Said the Elder, “What does this mean?” Said the treasurer’s son, “Reverend Sir, this woman used to be my dearest male friend. One day he looked upon you and thought this and that and was immediately transformed from a man into a woman. Pardon her, Reverend Sir.” Said the Elder, “Very well, rise. I pardon you.”*";
P_HTM[1201]="***As soon as the Elder uttered the words “I pardon you,” Soreyya was transformed from a woman into a man. As soon as she was transformed again into a man, the son of the treasurer of Takkasilā said to her, “Good friend, since you are the mother of these two boys and I am their father, they are truly the sons of us both. Therefore we may continue to live here. Be not unhappy.” Soreyya replied, “Friend, I have undergone two transformations in one state of existence. First I was a man, then I was a woman, and now I have again become a man. First I became the father of two sons, and but recently I became the mother of two sons. Think not that, after having undergone two transformations in one state of existence, I shall ever live the house-life again. I shall become a monk under my noble Elder. It is your duty to care for these two boys. Do not neglect them.” So saying, Soreyya kissed the two boys and embraced them, and handing them over to their father, departed from the house and became a monk under the Elder. The Elder admitted Soreyya to the Order, received his full profession, and then, taking him with him, set out for Sāvatthi, and in due time arrived at that city. Thereafter he was known as Elder Soreyya.*";
P_HTM[1202]="***When the inhabitants of the country learned what had happened, they were much agitated and excited. And approaching the Elder Soreyya, they asked him, “Reverend Sir, is this report true?” “Yes, brethren.” “Reverend Sir, matters stand thus: you are said to be the mother of two sons and the father of two sons as well. For which pair of sons have you the stronger affection?” “For the pair of which I am the mother.” All those who came invariably asked the Elder the same question, and again and again the Elder returned the answer, “I have the stronger affection for the pair of sons of which I am the mother.”*";
P_HTM[1203]="***Thereupon the Elder withdrew himself from the multitude: when he sat, he sat alone, and when he stood, he stood alone. Having thus sought solitude, he grasped firmly the thought of decay and death and attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. All those who came to see him asked the question, “Was that report true, Reverend Sir? Was that report true?” “Yes, brethren.” “For which pair of sons have you the stronger affection?” “My affections are set on no one.”*";
P_HTM[1204]="***Said the monks to the Teacher, “This monk says what is not true. On former days he used to say, ‘I have the stronger affection for the pair of sons of which I am the mother.’ Now, however, he says, ‘My affections are set on no one.’ He utters falsehood, Reverend Sir.” Said the Teacher, “Monks, my son does not utter falsehood. My son’s mind has been rightly directed ever since the day when he beheld the Path. Neither a mother nor a father can confer the benefit which a well-directed mind alone confers on these living beings.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1205]="***43. Neither mother nor father could do this, nor other relatives besides;*";

P_HTM[1210]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to five hundred monks who spent their time talking about the soil.*";
P_HTM[1211]="***One evening, it appears, these monks returned to Jetavana after a journey through the country with the Teacher, and assembling in the Hall of State, began to talk about the various kinds of soil they had seen in going from one village to another, such as even and uneven, abounding in mud, abounding in gravel, black clay, red clay. The Teacher approached and asked them, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here now talking about?” “Reverend Sir,” they replied, “we were talking about the different kinds of soil we saw in the places we visited.” “Monks,” said the Teacher, “this is the outer soil. It behooves you rather to cleanse the inner soil of the heart.” So saying, he pronounced the two following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1212]="***44. Who shall overcome this earth, and this World of Yama, and the World of the Gods?*";

P_HTM[1218]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to a certain monk who meditated on a mirage.*";
P_HTM[1219]="***This monk, we are told, obtained a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher and entered the forest for the purpose of practicing meditation. But when, after striving and struggling with might and main, he was unable to attain Arahatship, he said to himself, “I will ask the Teacher to give me a Subject of Meditation better suited to my needs.” With this thought in mind he set out to return to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1220]="***On the way he saw a mirage. Said he to himself, “Even as this mirage seen in the season of the heat appears substantial to those that are far off, but vanishes on nearer approach, so also is this existence unsubstantial by reason of birth and decay.” And fixing his mind on the mirage, he exercised himself in meditation on the mirage. On his return, wearied with the journey, he bathed in the river Aciravatī and seated himself in the shade of a tree on the bank of the river near a waterfall. As he sat there watching great bubbles of foam rising and bursting, from the force of the water striking against the rocks, he said to himself, “Just so is this existence also produced and just so does it burst.” And this he took for his Subject of Meditation.*";
P_HTM[1221]="***The Teacher, seated in his Perfumed Chamber, saw the Elder and said, “Monk, it is even so. Like a bubble of foam or a mirage is this existence. Precisely thus is it produced and precisely thus does it pass away.” And when he had thus spoken, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1222]="***46. He who knows that this body is like foam, he who clearly comprehends that it is of the nature of a mirage,*";
P_HTM[1223]="***Such a man will break the flower-tipped arrows of Māra and will go where the King of Death will not see him.*";

P_HTM[1228]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Viḍūḍabha and his retinue, who were overwhelmed by a mighty flood and swept away to death. From beginning to end the story is as follows:*";
P_HTM[1229]="***At Sāvatthi lived Prince Pasenadi, son of the king of the Kosalans; at Vesali, Prince Mahāli of the Licchavi line; at Kusinārā, Prince Bandhula, son of the king of the Mallas. These three princes resorted to a world-renowned teacher at Takkasilā for instruction. Happening to meet in a rest-house outside of the city, they asked each other’s reasons for coming, families, and names, and became friends. All of them studied under the same teacher at the same time, and in no long time acquiring proficiency in the various arts, took leave of their teacher, departed together, and went to their respective homes.*";
P_HTM[1230]="***Prince Pasenadi so delighted his father with the exhibition he gave of proficiency in the various arts that his father sprinkled him king.*";
P_HTM[1231]="***Prince Mahāli devoted himself to the task of educating the Licchavi princes, but over-exerting himself, lost the sight of his eyes. Said the Licchavi princes, “Alas! our teacher has lost the sight of his eyes. However, we will not cast him out, but will support him loyally.” Accordingly they gave him a gate worth a hundred thousand pieces of money. Near this gate he lived, instructing the five hundred Licchavi princes in the various arts.*";
P_HTM[1232]="***As for Prince Bandhula, the princely families of the Mallas bound sticks of bamboo together in bundles of sixty each, inserting a strip of iron in each bundle, suspended sixty bundles in the air, and challenged the prince to cut them down. The prince leaped eighty cubits into the air and smote them with his sword. Hearing the click of iron in the last bundle, he asked, “What is that?” When he learned that a strip of iron had been placed in each of the bundles, he threw away his sword and burst into tears, saying, “Of all these kinsmen and friends of mine, not a single one thought enough of me to tell me this fact. For had I only known it, I should have cut the bundles without causing the iron to give forth a sound.” And he said to his mother and father, “I will kill everyone of these princes and rule in their stead.” They replied, “Son, the kingdom is handed down from father to son, and it will therefore be impossible for you to do this.” By various devices they dissuaded him from carrying out his plan, whereupon he said, “Well then, I will go and live with a friend of mine,” and forthwith went to Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1233]="***King Pasenadi, hearing that he was coming, went forth to meet him, escorted him into the city with distinguished honors, and appointed him commander-in-chief of his army. Bandhula sent for his mother and father and established his residence right there in the city of Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1234]="***Now one day, as the king was standing on the terrace looking down into the street, he saw several thousand monks pass through the street on their way to breakfast in the houses of Anāthapiṇḍika, Culla Anāthapiṇḍika, Visākhā, and Suppāvāsa. “Where are these reverend monks going?” He inquired. “Your majesty, every day two thousand monks go to the house of Anāthapiṇḍika for food, medicine, and so forth; five hundred to the house of Culla Anāthapiṇḍika; and a like number to the houses of Visākhā and Suppāvāsa.” The king also conceived a desire to minister to the Congregation of Monks, and going to the monastery, invited the Teacher and his thousand monks to take their meals in his house. For seven days he presented alms to the Teacher, and on the seventh day paid obeisance to him and said, “Henceforth take your meals in my house regularly with five hundred monks.” “Great king, the Buddhas never take their meals regularly in any one place; many desire the Buddhas to visit them.” “Well then, send one monk regularly.” The Teacher imposed the duty on the Elder Ānanda.*";
P_HTM[1235]="***When the Congregation of Monks arrived, the king took their bowls and for seven days waited upon them in person, allowing no one else to perform that office. On the eighth day he suffered from distraction of mind and neglected to perform his duty. The monks said to themselves, “In the house of a king no one may provide seats for the monks and wait upon them unless he is expressly ordered to do so. It will therefore be impossible for us to remain here any longer.” Accordingly many departed. On the second day also the king neglected his duty, and accordingly on the second day many departed. Likewise on the third day the king neglected his duty, with the result that on that day all the remaining monks departed with the single exception of the Elder Ānanda.*";
P_HTM[1236]="***They that are truly righteous rise above circumstances and guard the faith of families. The Tathāgata had two principal male disciples, the Elder Sāriputta and the Elder Mahā Moggallāna, and two principal female disciples, Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā. Among the lay disciples there were two principal male lay disciples, the householder Citta and Hatthaka Āḷavaka, and two principal female lay disciples, Velukaṇṭhakī, mother of Nanda, and Khujjutarā. To put it briefly, all the disciples, beginning with these eight persons, had made their Earnest Wish, had fulfilled the Ten Perfections, and had thus acquired great merit. Likewise the Elder Ānanda had made his Earnest Wish, had fulfilled the Ten Perfections during a hundred thousand cycles of time, and had thus acquired great merit. Therefore did the Elder Ānanda rise superior to circumstances, and therefore did he remain, guarding the faith of the king’s house. And they provided a seat for the Elder Ānanda alone and ministered to him.*";
P_HTM[1237]="***When it was time for the monks to depart, the king came, and observing that the food, both hard and soft, had not been touched, he inquired, “Did not the noble monks come?” “The Elder Ānanda was the only one who came, your majesty.” “Just see the loss they have caused me,” said the king. Angry at the monks, he went to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, I prepared food for five hundred monks, and Ānanda, it appears, was the only one who came. The food which was prepared remains there still untouched, and the monks have not put in the sign of an appearance in my house. Pray what is the reason for this?” The Teacher, imputing no fault to the monks, replied, “Great king, my disciples lack confidence in you; it must be for that reason that they failed to come.” And addressing the monks and setting forth first the conditions under which monks are not bound to visit families, and then the conditions under which it is proper for them so to do, he recited the following Sutta,*";
P_HTM[1238]="***“Monks, there are nine traits the possession of which by a family disqualifies that family from receiving visits from the monks. Therefore if monks have not visited that family, they are under no obligations to visit it; and if they do visit it, they are under no obligations to sit down. What are the nine? They do not rise to meet them in a pleasing manner; they do not greet them in a pleasing manner; they do not seat them in a pleasing manner; they conceal what they possess; possessing much, they give little; possessing food of superior quality, they give food of inferior quality; instead of presenting their offerings respectfully, they present them disrespectfully; they do not sit down to hear the Law; they do not speak in a pleasing tone of voice. These, monks, are the nine traits the possession of which by a family disqualifies that family from receiving visits from the monks. Therefore if monks have not visited that family, they are under no obligations to visit it; and if they do visit it, they are under no obligations to sit down.*";
P_HTM[1239]="***“Conversely, monks, there are nine traits the possession of which by a family entitles that family to receive visits from the monks. Therefore if monks have not visited that family, it is proper for them to visit it; and if they do visit it, it is proper for them to sit down. What are the nine? They rise to meet them in a pleasing manner; they greet them in a pleasing manner; they seat them in a pleasing manner; they do not conceal what they possess; possessing much, they give much; possessing food of superior quality, they give food of superior quality; instead of presenting their offerings disrespectfully, they present them respectfully; they sit down to hear the Law; they speak in a pleasing tone of voice. These, monks, are the nine traits the possession of which by a family entitles that family to receive visits from the monks. Therefore if monks have not visited that family, it is proper for them to visit it; and if they do visit it, it is proper for them to sit down.*";
P_HTM[1240]="***“For this reason, great king, my disciples lacked confidence in you; it must be for this reason that they failed to come. Even so did wise men of old reside in a place unworthy of their confidence, and though served with respect, suffer the agonies of death, and therefore go to a place worthy of their confidence.” “When was that?” asked the king. So the Teacher related the following*";
P_HTM[1241]="***3 a. Story of the Past: Kesava, Kappa, Nārada, and the King of Benāres*";
P_HTM[1242]="***In times past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benāres, a king named Kesava renounced his throne, retired from the world, and adopted the life of an ascetic; and five hundred of his retainers followed his example and retired from the world. Thereafter the king was known as the ascetic Kesava. Kappa, the keeper of his jewels, likewise retired from the world and became his pupil. The ascetic Kesava with his retinue resided for eight months in the Himālaya country and when the rainy season began, came to Benāres seeking salt and vinegar and entered the city for alms. The king was glad to see him, obtained his promise to live with him during the four months of the rains, gave him lodging in his garden, and went to wait upon him every evening and every morning.*";
P_HTM[1243]="***The rest of the ascetics, after living there for a few days, were so annoyed by the sounds of the elephants and other animals that they became discontented and went to Kesava and said, “Teacher, we are unhappy and are going away.” “Where are you going, brethren?” “To the Himālaya country, Teacher.” “The very day we arrived the king obtained our promise to reside here during the four months of the rains. How then can we go, brethren?” “You did not so much as tell us when you gave him your promise; we cannot reside here any longer. We shall take up our residence not far from here, where we shall have news of you.” So they paid obeisance to him and departed, and the Teacher was left alone with his pupil Kappa.*";
P_HTM[1244]="***When the king came to wait upon him, he asked, “Where have the noble monks gone?” “They said they were discontented and unhappy and have gone to the Himālaya country, great king.” It was not long before Kappa also became discontented. Although the Teacher tried repeatedly to dissuade him from leaving, he insisted that he could endure it no longer. So he departed, going and joining the others and taking up his residence not far off, where he could receive news of the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1245]="***The Teacher thought continually of his pupils and after a time began to suffer from an internal complaint. The king had him treated by physicians, but there was no improvement in his condition. Finally the ascetic said to him, “Great king, do you wish to have me get well?” “Reverend Sir, if only I could, I would make you well again this moment.” “Great king, if you desire to have me get well, send me to my pupils.” “Very well, Reverend Sir,” said the king. So the king had the ascetic laid on a bed and ordered four ministers led by Nārada to carry him to his pupils, saying to the ministers, “Find out how my noble Elder is getting on and send me word.”*";
P_HTM[1246]="***The pupil Kappa, hearing that the Teacher was coming, went to meet him. “Where are the others?” asked Kesava. “They live in such and such a place,” replied Kappa. When the others heard that the Teacher had arrived, they assembled together, provided the Teacher with hot water, and presented him with various kinds of fruits. At that very moment he recovered from his sickness, and in a few days his body again took on a golden hue. Nārada asked him, “After leaving a king able to fulfill all desires, how, pray, does the Exalted Kesi like the hermitage of Kappa?” “Pleasant and agreeable are the trees, delighting the heart; the well-spoken words of Kappa delight me, Nārada.” “After eating the purest of hill-paddy, boiled with meat-gravy, how do you like millet and wild rice without salt?” “Whether the food be displeasing or pleasing, scanty or abundant, if only one can eat with confidence, confidence is the best flavor.”*";
P_HTM[1247]="***When the Teacher had ended his lesson, he identified the characters in the Jātaka as follows, “At that time the king was Moggallāna, Nārada was Sāriputta, the pupil Kappa was Ānanda, and the ascetic Kesava was I myself. Thus, great king, in former times also wise men endured the agonies of death and went to a place worthy of their confidence. My own disciples lack confidence in you, I doubt not.” Story of the Past concluded.*";
P_HTM[1248]="***The king thought to himself, “I must win the confidence of the Congregation of Monks. How best can I do it? The best way is for me to introduce into my house the daughter of some kinsman of the Supremely Enlightened One. In such case the probationers and novices will come to my house with confidence regularly, thinking, ‘The king is a kinsman of the Supremely Enlightened One.’ ” Accordingly he sent a message to the Sākiyas, saying, “Give me one of your daughters.” And he ordered the messengers to learn the name of the Sākiya whose daughter it was and to return to him. The messengers went and asked the Sākiyas for a maiden.*";
P_HTM[1249]="***The Sākiyas assembled and said to each other, “The king is an enemy of ours. Therefore if we refuse to give him what he demands, he will destroy us. Moreover, he is not of equal birth with ourselves. What is to be done?” Mahānāma said, “I have a daughter named Vāsabhakhattiyā, born of a slave-woman of mine, and she is a maiden of surpassing beauty; we will give her to him.” So he said to the messengers, “Very well, we will give the king one of our maidens.” “Whose daughter is it?” “She is the daughter of Mahānāma the Sākiya, and Mahānāma is the son of the uncle of the Supremely Enlightened One. The maiden’s name is Vāsabhakhattiyā.” The messengers went and told the king.*";
P_HTM[1250]="***Said the king, “If this be so, well and good. Bring her to me immediately. But those princes of the Warrior caste are full of deceit; they may even send me the daughter of a slave-woman. Therefore do not bring her unless she eats out of the same dish as her father.” So saying, he sent the messengers back. They went to Mahānāma and said, “Your majesty, the king desires that she eat with you.” “Very well, friends,” said Mahānāma. So he had his daughter adorn herself and come to him at meal-time. And he went through the form of eating with her, and then delivered her over to the messengers. The messengers escorted her to Sāvatthi and told the king what had happened. The king’s heart rejoiced, and he straightway placed her at the head of five hundred women and sprinkled her as his chief consort.*";
P_HTM[1251]="***In no long time she gave birth to a son, the hue of whose body was as the hue of gold. The king rejoiced thereat and sent word to his own grandmother, “Vāsabhakhattiyā, daughter of the king of the Sākiyas, has given birth to a son. Give him a name.” Now the minister who took the message and conveyed it to the king’s grandmother was a little deaf. The result was that when the grandmother, upon receiving the message, exclaimed, “Even before she gave birth to a child, Vāsabhakhattiyā won the hearts of all the people; but now she must be dear to the king beyond measure,” the deaf minister mistook the word vallabhā, “dear,” for Viḍūḍabha, and went and said to the king, “Give the prince the name Viḍūḍabha.” The king thought to himself, “That must be one of our old family names,” and gave the child the name Viḍūḍabha. When he was but a mere boy, the king appointed him commander-in-chief of the army, thinking that it would please the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1252]="***Viḍūḍabha was brought up in princely state. When he was seven years old, observing that the other princes received presents of toy elephants, horses, and the like from their maternal grandfathers, he asked his mother, “Mother, the other princes receive presents from their maternal grandfathers, but no one ever sends me any. Have you no mother and father?” She replied, “Dear son, your grandparents are Sākiya kings, and they live a long way off; that is why they never send you anything.” Thus did she deceive him. Again when he was sixteen years old, he said to her, “Dear mother, I should like to go and see your family, that of my maternal grandfather.” But she put him off, saying, “Nay, my dear son, what would you do there?” However, in spite of her refusals, he repeated his request several times.*";
P_HTM[1253]="***Finally his mother gave her consent, saying, “Very well, you may go.” He informed his father and set out with a large retinue. Vāsabhakhattiyā sent a letter ahead of him, saying, “I am living here happily. Let not my lords make any difference in their treatment of him.” When the Sākiyas learned that Viḍūḍabha was coming, they said to themselves, “It is impossible for us to pay obeisance to him.” Accordingly they sent the younger princes to the country, and when he arrived at the city of Kapila, they assembled in the royal rest-house. Viḍūḍabha arrived at the rest-house and stopped there. They said to him, “Friend, this is your maternal grandfather and this is your uncle.” As he went about, paying obeisance to all, he noticed that not a single one paid obeisance to him. So he asked, “How is it there are none that pay obeisance to me?” The Sākiyas replied, “Friend, the younger princes have gone to the country.” However, they showed him every hospitality. After remaining there a few days, he departed with his large retinue.*";
P_HTM[1254]="***Now a certain slave-woman washed with milk and water the seat in the royal rest-house on which Viḍūḍabha had sat; and as she did so, she remarked contemptuously, “This is the seat on which sat the son of the slave-woman Vāsabhakhattiyā!” A certain man who had forgotten his sword went back for it, and as he took it, overheard the slave-woman’s contemptuous remark about the prince Viḍūḍabha. Inquiring into the matter, he learned that Vāsabhakhattiyā was the daughter of a slave-woman of Mahānāma the Sākiya. And he went and informed the army, “Vāsabhakhattiyā, I am told, is the daughter of a slave-woman.” Immediately there was a great uproar. When Viḍūḍabha learned of the incident, he made the following vow, “These Sākiyas now wash the seat whereon I sat with milk and water; when I am established in my kingdom, I will wash my seat with the blood of their throats.”*";
P_HTM[1255]="***When the prince returned to Sāvatthi, the ministers told the king everything that had happened. The king was angry at the Sākiyas for giving him the daughter of a slave-woman, cut off the royal honors which had been bestowed on Vāsabhakhattiyā and her son, and degraded them to the condition of slaves.*";
P_HTM[1256]="***A few days afterwards the Teacher went to the royal residence and sat down. The king came, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Reverend Sir, I am informed that it was the daughter of a slave-woman that your kinsmen gave me. I have therefore cut off the royal honors which have hitherto been bestowed on her and her son and have degraded them to the condition of slaves.” The Teacher replied, “It was not right, great king, for the Sākiyas so to do. When they gave you one of their daughters, they should have given you a maiden of equal birth with yourself. But, great king, I have this also to say to you: Vāsabhakhattiyā is the daughter of a king and received the ceremonial sprinkling in the house of a king of the Warrior caste. Viḍūḍabha also is the son of a king. What matters the family of the mother? It is the family of the father that affords the only true measure of social position. Wise men of old bestowed the honor of chief consort on a poor woman who picked up sticks; and the prince she bore became king of Benāres, a city twelve leagues in extent, and bore the name Katthavāhana.” So saying, he related the Kaṭṭhahārika Jātaka. The king listened to his discourse on the Law, and pleased at the thought, “It is the family of the father that affords the only true measure of social position,” restored to mother and son their former honors.*";
P_HTM[1257]="***At Kusinārā, Mallikā, daughter of Mallikā and wife of Bandhula, commander-in-chief of the army, remained for a long time childless. Accordingly Bandhula put her away, saying, “Go back again to the house of your own family.” She thought to herself, “I will see the Teacher before I go.” Therefore she entered Jetavana, paid obeisance to the Tathāgata, and waited. “Where are you going?” asked the Teacher. “My husband has sent me back to the house of my family, Reverend Sir.” “Why?” “On the ground that I am barren, having borne him no children.” “If this be true, it is no reason why you should go back to your family. Return to your husband.” Joyful at heart, she paid obeisance to the Teacher and returned to her husband’s house. “Why have you returned?” he asked. “I was directed to return by Him that is Possessed of the Ten Forces,” she replied. “The Far-seeing One must have seen some reason,” thought Bandhula and acquiesced.*";
P_HTM[1258]="***After a short time Mallikā conceived a child in her womb, and the longing of pregnancy arose within her. She said to her husband, “The longing of pregnancy has arisen within me.” “What is the nature of your longing?” he asked. She replied, “Husband, in the city of Vesali is a lotus-tank used by troops of princes at coronation festivals. I long to descend therein, to swim therein, and to drink the water thereof.” “Very well,” said Bandhula. And taking his bow, which required the strength of a thousand men to string, he assisted his wife to mount the chariot and drove in his chariot from Sāvatthi to Vesali, entering Vesali by the gate which had been given to the Licchavi prince Mahāli. Now the Licchavi prince Mahāli dwelt in a house hard by the gate; and when he heard the rumble of the chariot on the threshold, he said to himself, “That is the sound of Bandhula’s chariot. There is trouble in store for the Licchavi princes to-day.”*";
P_HTM[1259]="***Both within and without the lotus-tank were posted strong guards, and the tank was covered overhead by an iron grating with meshes so small that not even birds could get through. But Bandhula, commander-in-chief of the army, descended from his chariot, smote the guards with his staff, and drove them away. Then he tore down the grating, entered the lotus-tank, and permitted his wife to bathe therein. And having himself bathed therein, he departed from the city and returned by the same road by which he came.*";
P_HTM[1260]="***The men of the guard reported the matter to the Licchavi princes. Thereupon the Licchavi princes were filled with rage, and mounting five hundred chariots, they departed from the city, saying, “We will capture Bandhula and Mallikā.” Mahāli said to them, “Do not go, for he will kill every man of you.” But they replied, “We will go all the same.” “Well then, turn back when you see his chariot sink into the ground up to the nave. If you do not turn back then, you will hear before you, as it were, the crash of a thunderbolt. Then you must not fail to turn back. If you do not turn back then, you will see a hole in the yokes of your chariots. Turn back then; go no farther.” But in spite of Mahāli’s warnings, they did not turn back, but pursued him.*";
P_HTM[1261]="***Mallikā saw them and said, “There are chariots in sight, husband.” “Very well! When they appear as a single chariot, tell me.” So when all of them appeared as a single chariot, she said, “It looks like the front of a single chariot.” “Well then,” said Bandhula, “take these reins.” And giving her the reins, he stood up in the chariot and raised his bow. Thereupon the wheels of his chariot sank into the ground up to the nave. Although the Licchavi princes saw his chariot sink into the ground, they did not turn back. After going a little way, Bandhula twanged his bow-string, the sound whereof was as the crash of a thunderbolt. Not even then did his enemies turn back, but continued their pursuit just the same. Then Bandhula, standing in his chariot, let fly a single arrow. The arrow made a hole in the front of each of five hundred chariots, passed through the body of each of five hundred princes at the spot where he wore his girdle, and then entered the earth.*";
P_HTM[1262]="***But the Licchavi princes, unaware that they were pierced through and through, cried out, “Halt where you are! Halt where you are!” So saying, they continued their pursuit. Bandhula stopped his chariot and said, “You are all dead men! I will not fight with the dead.” “Do we look like dead men?” they asked. “Well then,” replied Bandhula, “loosen the girdle of the foremost of your band.” They loosened his girdle. The instant it was loosened he fell down dead. Then said Bandhula, “You are all in the same plight as your leader. Go to your own homes, settle such of your concerns as need to be settled, give final instructions to your sons and your wives, and then take off your armor.” They did so, whereupon all of them fell down dead. Then Bandhula conducted Mallikā to Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1263]="***Sixteen times Mallikā bore twin sons to Bandhula, and all of them were valiant men, endowed with great strength. All of them attained perfection in the several arts. Each of them had a retinue of a thousand men; and when they accompanied their father to the royal residence, the palace court was filled with their numerous company. One day some men who had been defeated in a false suit in court saw Bandhula approaching, and with loud cries of protest told him of the unjust actions of the judges. Bandhula thereupon went to the court and decided the case in such wise as to make the rightful owner the actual owner. The populace applauded him with loud shouts of approval. The king asked, “What is this commotion about?” When he heard the explanation, he was pleased, and removing all those judges, he turned over the administration of justice to Bandhula alone, who thereafter rendered just judgments.*";
P_HTM[1264]="***The former judges, who suffered severe loss from the cutting off of their bribes, created dissensions among the members of the royal family, saying, “Bandhula aspires to the throne.” The king believed their talk and was unable to control his feelings. “But,” thought he, “if this man is killed right here, I shall be severely blamed.” On second thought he suborned men to make an attack on his own frontier. Then he summoned Bandhula and sent him forth, saying, “I am informed that the frontier is in a state of insurrection. Take your sons with you and go and capture the brigands.” And he sent with him a sufficient number of powerful warriors besides, saying to them, “Cut off the heads of Bandhula and his two and thirty sons and bring them to me.” When Bandhula reached the frontier and the hired brigands heard that the commander-in-chief had come, they fled. Bandhula rendered the country habitable once more, restored peace, and then set out on his return. When he reached a place not far from the city, those warriors attacked him and cut off his head and the heads of his sons.*";
P_HTM[1265]="***That day Mallikā had invited the two Chief Disciples to her house, together with five hundred monks. And that very morning they brought and gave her a letter reading as follows, “Your husband’s head has been cut off and likewise the heads of your sons.” When she learned the news, she said not a word to anyone, but put the letter in a fold of her dress and ministered to the Congregation of Monks as if nothing had happened. Now it happened that while her servants were serving food to the monks, they brought in a jar of ghee and let the jar fall and break before the very eyes of the Elders. The Captain of the Faith said, “No notice should ever be taken of the breaking of anything that is capable of being broken.” Thereupon Mallikā, drawing the letter from the fold of her dress, said, “They have just brought me this letter: ‘The head of your husband has been cut off and the heads of your two and thirty sons likewise.’ Yet even when I heard this, I took no thought. Much less, therefore, am I likely to take thought of the breaking of a mere jar, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[1266]="***The Captain of the Faith recited the Stanzas beginning, “Unmarked, unknown, is the life of mortals here,” and having taught the Law, rose from his seat and went to the monastery. Mallikā summoned her two and thirty daughters-in-law and admonished them as follows, “Your husbands were free from guilt and have merely reaped the fruit of misdeeds in previous states of existence. Grieve not, nor lament. Cherish no resentment against the king.” The king’s spies listened to her words and went and told the king that they cherished no hatred of him. The king was overcome with emotion, went to Mallikā’s residence, asked Mallikā and her daughters-in-law to forgive him, and granted Mallikā a boon. “I accept,” said she.*";
P_HTM[1267]="***So when the king had departed and she had given the feast in honor of the dead, she bathed, and approaching the king, said, “Your majesty, you granted me a boon. I desire nothing other than this, that you permit me and my two and thirty daughters-in-law to return to the homes of our families.” The king consented, and she thereupon sent her two and thirty daughters-in-law to their respective homes and herself went to the city of Kusinārā to the house of her own family. The king appointed to the post of commander-in-chief of the army Dīghakārāyaṇa, a nephew of the former commander-in-chief Bandhula. And Dīghakārāyaṇa went about reviling the king and saying, “It was the king that killed my uncle.”*";
P_HTM[1268]="***From the day the king killed the guiltless Bandhula he suffered from remorse, had no peace of mind, and experienced no pleasure in ruling. Now at that time the Teacher was in residence near a small village of the Sākiyas named Uḷumpa. The king went thither, pitched camp not far from the Grove where the Teacher resided, and thinking, “I will pay my respects to the Teacher,” went to the monastery, accompanied by a small retinue. Giving the five symbols of royalty to Dīghakārāyaṇa, he entered the Perfumed Chamber alone. (Everything is to be understood as narrated in the Dhammacetiya Suttanta.)*";
P_HTM[1269]="***When Pasenadi entered the Perfumed Chamber, Kārāyaṇa took the five symbols of royalty and made Viḍūḍabha king. Then, leaving behind a single horse and a single female servant for Pasenadi, he went to Sāvatthi. The king held sweet converse with the Teacher, and then came out. Not seeing the army, he questioned the woman, and from her learned what had happened. “I will take my nephew with me and capture Viḍūḍabha,” said the king, and went to the city of Rājagaha. It was late in the day when he reached the city, and the gates were closed. Exhausted by exposure to the wind and the sun, Pasendi lay down in a certain rest-house and died there in the night. As the night grew bright, they heard the voice of that woman lamenting, “King of Kosala, you have lost your protector!” And they went and told the new king. Thereupon Viḍūḍabha performed the funeral rites over the body of his uncle Pasenadi with great pomp.*";
P_HTM[1270]="***When Viḍūḍabha became king, he remembered his grudge. And saying to himself, “I will slay all the Sākiyas,” he set out with a large army. On that day, as the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn, he saw the impending destruction of his kinsfolk. And thinking, “I must protect my kinsfolk,” he went on his round for alms in the morning; and returning from his alms-pilgrimage, lay down lion-like on his right side in the Perfumed Chamber; and in the evening went through the air and sat down at the foot of a tree with scanty shade in the vicinity of Kapilavatthu. Not far from there, on the boundary of Viḍūḍabha’s kingdom, stood a great banyan-tree giving dense shade.*";
P_HTM[1271]="***Viḍūḍabha, seeing the Teacher, approached him, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Reverend Sir, why do you sit at the foot of this tree with scanty shade when it is so hot? Sit at the foot of this banyan-tree which gives dense shade, Reverend Sir.” “Be not concerned, great king. The shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool.” “The Teacher must have come for the purpose of protecting his kinsfolk,” thought Viḍūḍabha, and having paid obeisance to the Teacher, he turned and went back to Sāvatthi. The Teacher rose into the air and returned to Jetavana.*";
P_HTM[1272]="***The king remembered his hatred of the Sākiyas and went forth the second time, but seeing the Teacher in the same place, turned back. Again the third time he went forth, but seeing the Teacher in the same place, turned back. But when he went forth the fourth time, the Teacher, surveying the former deeds of the Sākiyas and realizing the impossibility of averting the consequences of the evil deed they committed by throwing poison into the river, refrained from going the fourth time.*";
P_HTM[1273]="***Viḍūḍabha therefore went forth with a large force, saying, “I will slay the Sākiyas.” Now the kinsmen of the Supremely Enlightened One do not slay their enemies, but are willing to die rather than take the lives of others. Therefore they said to themselves, “We are trained and skillful; we are expert archers and adepts with the long bow. Since it is unlawful for us to take the lives of others, we will put them to flight by a display of our skill.” So they put on their armor and went forth and began battle. The arrows they shot sped through the ranks of Viḍūḍabha’s men, passing between their shields and through the holes for the ears, without hitting a man. When Viḍūḍabha saw the arrows fly, he said, “I have understood it to be a boast of the Sākiyas that they do not kill their enemies; but they are now killing my men.” One of his men asked him, “Master, why do you turn and look about you?” “The Sākiyas are killing my men.” “Not one of your men is dead; pray have them counted.” He had them counted and perceived that he had not lost one.*";
P_HTM[1274]="***As Viḍūḍabha turned back, he said to his men, “I direct you to kill all those who say, ‘We are Sākiyas,’ but to spare the lives of those who follow Mahānāma the Sākiya.” The Sākiyas stood their ground, and having no other resources, some took blades of grass in their teeth, while others held reeds. Now the Sākiyas would rather die than utter an untruth. So when they were asked, “Are you Sākiyas or not?” those who held blades of grass in their teeth said, “Not sāka, ‘potherb,’ but ‘grass’;” while those who held reeds said, “Not sāka, ‘potherb,’ but ‘reed.’ ” The lives of those who followed Mahānāma were spared. Those of the Sākiyas who held blades of grass in their teeth came to be known as Grass Sākiyas, and those who held reeds as Reed Sākiyas. Viḍūḍabha slew all the rest, sparing not even infants at the breast. And when he had set flowing a river of blood, he washed his seat with the blood of their throats. Thus was the stock of the Sākiyas uprooted by Viḍūḍabha.*";
P_HTM[1275]="***Viḍūḍabha captured Mahānāma the Sākiya and set out to return. When it was time for breakfast, he stopped at a certain place and thought to himself, “I will now have breakfast.” When the food was brought to him, he said to himself, “I will eat with my grandfather,” and sent for him. Now members of the Warrior caste would rather give up their lives than eat with the sons of slave-women. Therefore Mahānāma, seeing a certain lake, said, “Dear grandson, my limbs are dirty. I wish to go and bathe.” “Very well, grandfather, go and bathe.” Mahānāma thought to himself, “If I refuse to eat with him, he will kill me. That being the case, it is better for me to die by my own hand.” So taking down his hair, he knotted it at the end, thrust his great toes into his hair, and plunged into the water.*";
P_HTM[1276]="***By the power of his merit the abode of the Nāgas manifested signs of heat. The king of the Nāgas, considering within himself, “What does this mean?” went to him, caused him to sit within his hood, and carried him to the abode of the Nāgas. There he dwelt for twelve years. Viḍūḍabha sat down and thought, “Now my grandfather will come; now my grandfather will come.” Finally, after his grandfather had, as he thought, tarried an excessively long time, he caused the lake to be searched by lamplight, even examining the insides of his followers’ clothing. Seeing him nowhere, he made up his mind, “He must have gone,” and departed.*";
P_HTM[1277]="***During the night Viḍūḍabha reached the river Aciravatī and pitched camp. Some of his followers lay down in the bed of the river on a bed of sand, others lay down on the banks on solid earth. Now those who lay in the bed of the river had not been guilty of sin in previous states of existence, but those who lay on the banks had been guilty of sin in previous states of existence. It so happened that ants came out of the ground where they lay. So they arose, saying, “There are ants where we are lying! There are ants where we are lying!” And those who had not been guilty of sin went up out of the bed of the river and lay down on solid earth, while those who had been guilty of sin descended and lay down on the bed of sand. At that moment a storm came up and there was an incessant downpour of rain. The flood filled the bed of the river and carried Viḍūḍabha and his retinue out to sea, and all of them became food for fishes and tortoises.*";
P_HTM[1278]="***The multitude began to discuss the incident. “The slaying of the Sākiyas was unjust. It was not right to say, ‘The Sākiyas must be killed,’ and to smite them and kill them.” The Teacher heard the discussion and said, “Monks, if you regard only this present existence, it was indeed unjust that the Sākiyas should die in such wise. What they received, however, was entirely just, considering the sin they committed in a previous state of existence.” “What was the sin they committed in a previous state of existence, Reverend Sir?” “In a previous state of existence they conspired together and threw poison into the river.”*";
P_HTM[1279]="***Again one day in the Hall of Truth the monks began a discussion: “Viḍūḍabha slew all those Sākiyas, and then, before the desire of his own heart had been fulfilled, he and his numerous company were swept out to sea and became food for fishes and tortoises.” The Teacher came in and asked, “Monks, what is it you are gathered here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, or ever the desire of these living beings be fulfilled, even as a mighty flood overwhelms a sleeping village, so the Prince of Death cuts short their lives and plunges them into the four oceans of suffering.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1280]="***47. Even while a man is gathering flowers and is absorbed in pleasure,*";
P_HTM[1281]="***Death comes and carries him off, even as a mighty flood overwhelms a sleeping village.*";
P_HTM[1282]="*[36] 4. Patipūjikakumārivatthu**4. Husband-Honorer*";
P_HTM[1283]="***48. Even while a man is gathering flowers, while his heart is absorbed in pleasure,*";
P_HTM[1284]="***Even before he has satisfied his desires, death overpowers him.*";
P_HTM[1285]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to a woman named Husband-honorer, Patipūjikā. The story begins in the World of the Thirty-three.*";
P_HTM[1286]="***The story goes that a god named Garland-wearer, Mālabhārī, entered the pleasure-garden in the World of the Thirty-three, accompanied by a thousand celestial nymphs. Five hundred of these nymphs climbed trees and threw down flowers; five hundred others gathered up the flowers that fell and decked the god therewith. One of these nymphs, even as she sat on the branch of a tree, passed from that state of existence, her body vanishing like the flame of a lamp, and received a new conception in Sāvatthi in a certain family of station. Born with a recollection of her former states of existence, and remembering that she had been the wife of the god Garland-wearer, she made offerings of perfumes and garlands when she grew up, making the Earnest Wish to be reborn with her former husband.*";
P_HTM[1287]="***When she was sixteen years of age, she married into another family. And even then, whenever she gave the monks Ticket-food or Fortnightly-food or food for the season of the rains, she would say, “May this offering assist me to obtain rebirth with my former husband.” Said the monks, “This woman, ever busy and active, yearns only for her husband.” Therefore they called her Husband-honorer, Patipūjikā. She cared regularly for the Hall of Assembly, supplied water for drinking, and provided seats for the monks. Whenever others desired to give Ticket-food or Fortnightly-food, they would bring it and give it to her, saying, “Dear lady, pray present these to the Congregation of Monks.” Going to and fro in this manner, she obtained at one and the same time the Fifty-six Qualities of Goodness. She became pregnant and at the end of ten lunar months gave birth to a son; when her son was old enough to walk, she gave birth to another son, and then to another, until she had four sons.*";
P_HTM[1288]="***One day she gave alms, rendered honor to the monks, listened to the Law, and kept the precepts, and at the end of that day died of some sudden sickness and was reborn with her former husband. During all that time the other celestial nymphs were decking the god with flowers. When the god Garland-wearer saw her, he said, “We have not seen you since morning. Where have you been?” “I passed from this existence, husband.” “What say you?” “Precisely so, husband.” “Where were you reborn?” “In a family of station at Sāvatthi.” “How long a time did you remain there?”*";
P_HTM[1289]="***“At the end of the tenth lunar month I issued from the womb of my mother. When I was sixteen years old, I married into another family. I bore four sons, gave alms, and rendered honor to the monks, making an Earnest Wish to return and be reborn with you, husband.” “How long is the life of men?” “Only a hundred years.” “So short as that?” “Yes, husband.” “If men are reborn with so short a time as that to live, do they spend their time asleep and heedless, or do they give alms and render honor?” “What say you, husband? Men are ever heedless, as if reborn with an incalculable number of years to live, as if in no wise subject to old age and death.”*";
P_HTM[1290]="***The god Garland-wearer was greatly agitated. Said he, “If, as you say, men are reborn with only a hundred years to live, and if they lie heedless and asleep, when will they ever obtain Release from Suffering?” (Now a hundred of our years are equivalent to a night and a day in the World of the Thirty-three Gods, thirty such nights and days make up a month, twelve such months make up a year, and the length of their lives is a thousand such celestial years; or, in human reckoning, thirty-six million years. Thus it was that for that god not a single day had passed; nay, not more than a moment of time. Therefore thought he to himself, “If the life of men is so short, it is highly improper for them to give themselves up to a life of heedlessness.”)*";
P_HTM[1291]="***On the following day the monks, on entering the village, found the Hall of Assembly uncared for, no seats provided, no water supplied for drinking. “Where is Husband-honorer?” said they. “Reverend Sirs, how could you expect to see her? Yesterday at eventide, after your reverences had eaten and departed, she died.” Thereupon monks who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion, remembering her kindly services to them, were unable to restrain their tears; while monks who had attained Arahatship were overcome with religious emotion.*";
P_HTM[1292]="***After eating their breakfast, they went to the monastery and asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, Husband-honorer, busy and active, performed all manner of works of merit and yearned only for her husband. Now she is dead. Where was she reborn?” “Monks, she was reborn with her own husband.” “But, Reverend Sir, she is not with her husband.” “Monks, she yearned not for that husband. Her husband was the god Garland-wearer in the World of the Thirty-three. She passed from that state of existence while decking him with flowers. Now she has returned to where she was before and has been reborn with him.” “Reverend Sir, is what you say true?” “Yes, monks, what I say is true.” “Oh, how short, Reverend Sir, is the life of creatures in this world! Early in the morning she served us with food, and in the evening she sickened and died.” The Teacher replied, “Yes, monks, the life of creatures in this world is indeed short. Therefore, while creatures in this world yet yearn for the things of earth and have not yet satisfied their desires for sensual pleasures, death overpowers them and carries them off wailing and weeping.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1293]="***48. Even while a man is gathering flowers, while his heart is absorbed in pleasure,*";
P_HTM[1294]="***Even before he has satisfied his desires, death overpowers him.*";
P_HTM[1295]="*[37] 5. Macchariyakosiyaseṭṭhivatthu**5. Niggardly Kosiya*";
P_HTM[1296]="***49. Even as a bee, without injuring a flower, or the color, or the scent thereof,*";
P_HTM[1297]="***Gathers the honey, and then flies away, even so should a sage go about village.*";
P_HTM[1298]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Niggardly Kosiya the treasurer. The story begins at Rājagaha.*";
P_HTM[1299]="***The story goes that in a town named Jaggery, not far from the city of Rājagaha, lived a certain treasurer named Niggardly Kosiya, possessed of eighty crores of treasure. Never a drop of oil small enough to stand on the tip of a blade of grass did he give to others or use for himself. The result was that his wealth, great as it was, yielded no enjoyment to his sons and daughters or to monks and Brahmans, but remained unused, like a pool haunted by evil spirits.*";
P_HTM[1300]="***One day, early in the morning, the Teacher arose from a Trance of Great Compassion and with the eye of a Buddha looked out upon his kinsmen in the faith all over the universe. As he did so, he beheld, living at a distance of forty-five leagues, the treasurer and his wife and perceived that they possessed the faculties requisite for Conversion.*";
P_HTM[1301]="***Now on the preceding day the treasurer went to the royal palace to wait upon the king. On his way home, after waiting upon the king, he saw a half-starved countryman eating a round cake filled with sour gruel. The sight made him hungry. When he reached his own home, he thought to himself, “If I say openly, ‘I should like to have a round cake to eat,’ there will be many others who will wish to eat with me. In that case a great quantity of sesame, rice, ghee, jaggery, and other provisions will be consumed. I will therefore say nothing to anyone.” So he walked about, enduring hunger as best he could. But as the hours went by, he grew yellow and yet more yellow, and the veins stood out all over his body. Finally, unable to endure hunger any longer, he went into his chamber and lay down hugging his bed. But in spite of his distress, so great was his fear of wasting his wealth that he said nothing to anybody.*";
P_HTM[1302]="***As he lay upon his bed, his wife approached him, rubbed his back, and asked him, “Husband, what is the matter with you?” “There is nothing the matter with me.” “Is the king put out with you?” “No, the king is not put out with me.” “Then perhaps your sons and daughters, or your slaves and servants, have done something to displease you?” “Nothing of the sort.” “But perhaps you have a craving for something?” When his wife said that, so great was his fear of wasting his wealth that he answered her never a word, but lay speechless on his bed. Then his wife said to him, “Tell me, husband. What is it you have a craving for?” Then said her husband, swallowing his words as he spoke them, “Yes, I have a craving for something.” “What is it you have a craving for, husband?” “I should like a round cake to eat.”*";
P_HTM[1303]="***“Why didn’t you tell me? Are you a poor man? I will straightway have enough round cakes baked to feed all the inhabitants of the town of Jaggery.” “Why concern yourself about them? They might better work and earn money for themselves to buy food.” “Very well, I will bake enough cakes to feed the inhabitants of one street.” “I have always thought you extravagant.” “Then I will bake enough cakes to feed all who live in this house.” “I have always thought you extravagant.” “Very well, I will bake only enough cakes for you and your children and your wife.” “Why concern yourself about them?” “Very well, I will bake just enough for you and me.” “Why should you care to have any?” “Very well, I will bake just enough for you alone.”*";
P_HTM[1304]="***Then said her husband, “There are a great many people on the outlook for cooking in this house. Therefore save out the whole grains of rice, use only the broken grains, and take the brazier and the potsherds and just a little milk and ghee and honey and jagghery, and go up to the top floor of our seven-storied mansion, and there I will sit down all by myself and eat.” “Very well,” replied his wife, promising to carry out his wishes. So she caused the necessary things to be procured, and having climbed to the top of the house, dismissed the servants and caused her husband to be summoned. Her husband climbed from one floor to another, closing and bolting each door after him, until finally he reached the seventh floor. Then, after closing and bolting the door, he sat down. His wife started a fire in the brazier, placed a potsherd on the brazier, and began to cook the cake.*";
P_HTM[1305]="***Now early in the morning the Teacher addressed Elder Moggallāna the Great, “Moggallāna, in yonder town of Jaggery, close to the city of Rājagaha, a niggardly treasurer, desiring to eat fried cakes, but afraid that somebody else may see him, is having cakes fried in his seven-storied mansion. Go there, overmaster that treasurer, inculcate in him the virtue of self-denial, take the treasurer and his wife and the cakes and the milk and ghee and honey and jaggery, and by your own power convey them to Jetavana. To-day I will sit with my five hundred monks in the monastery and will make my meal of those very cakes.” “Very well, Reverend Sir,” replied the Elder, promising to carry out the Teacher’s command.*";
P_HTM[1306]="***In but an instant, by virtue of his magical power, the Elder proceeded to that town. And before the window of that mansion, properly garbed in under and outer garments, he stood poised in the air like a jeweled image. When the great treasurer saw the Elder, his heart’s flesh quivered and quaked. “It was for fear of just such persons,” said he, “that I came to this place; yet here this fellow comes and stands in front of my window.” Not realizing that the Elder would inevitably get what he must needs get, sputtering with anger, even as when salt and sugar are thrown into a fire, the treasurer spoke thus, “Monk, what do you expect to get by standing poised in the air? You may walk up and down till you cause a path to appear in the pathless air, but for all that you will get nothing by it.” The Elder continued to walk back and forth right there, as before.*";
P_HTM[1307]="***Said the treasurer, “What do you expect to get by walking back and forth? You may sit down cross-legged in the air, but for all that you will get nothing by it.” The Elder folded his legs and sat down cross-legged. Then said the treasurer to him, “What do you expect to get by sitting down cross-legged? You may come and stand on the window-sill, but for all that you will get nothing by it.” Then the Elder came and stood on the window-sill. Then said the treasurer to him, “What do you expect to get by coming and standing on the window-sill? You may belch forth smoke, but for all that you will get nothing by it.”*";
P_HTM[1308]="***Then the Elder belched forth smoke until the whole mansion was one mass of smoke. The treasurer felt as though his eyes had been pierced with needles. He was so afraid the house might catch fire that he refrained from saying, “You may burst into flames, but for all that you will get nothing by it.” He thought to himself, “This monk sticks fast and will not depart until he gets something. I will have him given one cake.” So he said to his wife, “Dear wife, cook one little cake, give it to the monk, and get rid of him.”*";
P_HTM[1309]="***His wife took just a little dough and put it in the pot. But it grew to be a big cake and filled the vessel to overflowing. When the treasurer saw it, he thought to himself, “She must have taken a big piece of dough.” So he himself took ever so little dough on the tip of a spoon and put it in the pot. But it became a bigger cake than the previous one. In like manner each cake they cooked was larger than the preceding ones. Finally, in despair, the treasurer said to his wife, “Dear wife, give him a single cake.”*";
P_HTM[1310]="***But when his wife tried to take one cake from the basket, all the cakes stuck together. The treasurer’s wife said to her husband, “Husband, the cakes all stick together. I cannot separate them.” “I will separate them,” replied the treasurer. But try as he might, he was unable to do so. Finally the treasurer took hold of one end, and his wife took hold of the other end, and the two pulled with might and main. But for all that they were unable to separate the cakes.*";
P_HTM[1311]="***As the treasurer struggled with the cakes, sweat poured forth from his body and his craving disappeared. Thereupon he said to his wife, “Wife, I have no need of the cakes. Take the cakes and the basket and give them to the monk.” So his wife took the basket and approached the monk. The Elder preached the Law to the treasurer and his wife, proclaiming the virtues of the Three Jewels. Beginning with the words, “Almsgiving is true sacrifice,” he made the fruit of almsgiving and of the other works of merit as plain as the moon in the sky.*";
P_HTM[1312]="***As the treasurer listened to him, his heart believed, and he said, “Reverend Sir, draw near, sit down on this couch, and eat.” The Elder replied, “Great treasurer, the Supremely Enlightened is sitting in the monastery, expecting to eat these cakes. Therefore, treasurer, if it so please you, bid your wife take the cakes and the milk and the other provisions, and let us go to the Teacher.” “But, Reverend Sir, where is the Teacher at this moment?” “Treasurer, he is at the Jetavana monastery, some forty-five leagues from here.” “Reverend Sir, how can we travel such a long distance without spending a great deal of time on the way?”*";
P_HTM[1313]="***“Great treasurer, if it so please you, I will convey you thither by my own magical power. The head of the staircase in your mansion shall remain in its proper place, but the foot of the staircase shall stand at the battlemented gate of Jetavana. I will convey you to Jetavana in less time than it would take you to go from the upper floor of your house to the lower floor.” “Very well, Reverend Sir,” said the treasurer, agreeing to the proposal. So the Elder, allowing the head of the staircase to remain where it was, commanded, “Let the foot of the staircase stand at the battlemented gate of Jetavana.” And it was so. The Elder conveyed the treasurer and his wife to Jetavana in less time than it would have taken them to go from the upper floor of their house to the lower floor.*";
P_HTM[1314]="***The treasurer and his wife both approached the Teacher and informed him that it was meal-time. Thereupon the Teacher entered the refectory and seated himself in the Seat of the Buddha, already prepared, with the Congregation of Monks about him. The great treasurer gave Water of Donation to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha. The treasurer’s wife placed a cake in the Tathāgata’s bowl. The Teacher took as much as he needed to support life, and the Congregation of Monks likewise took as much as they needed to support life. The treasurer went about distributing milk and ghee and honey and jaggery.*";
P_HTM[1315]="***The Teacher and his five hundred monks completed their meal, and the great treasurer and his wife ate as much as they desired to eat. Yet there was no end to the cakes that remained. Even after distribution had been made to the monks of the entire monastery and to the eaters of scraps, there was still no end to the cakes that remained. “Reverend Sir,” they reported to the Exalted One, “the cakes suffer no diminution.” “Very well,” he replied, “throw them away at the battlemented gate of Jetavana.” So they threw them away in a cave near the battlemented gate of Jetavana. To this day that place goes by the name of “Cake-cave.”*";
P_HTM[1316]="***Then the great treasurer with his wife approached the Exalted One and stood respectfully on one side. The Exalted One pronounced the words of thanksgiving. At the conclusion of the words of thanksgiving both the treasurer and his wife were established in the Fruit of Conversion. Then they saluted the Teacher, and mounting the staircase at the battlemented gate, found themselves in their own house. From that time forwards the treasurer spent eighty crores of treasure solely in the Religion of the Buddha.*";
P_HTM[1317]="***On the evening of the following day, when the monks assembled in the Hall of Truth, they exclaimed, “Behold, brethren, the supernatural power of Elder Moggallāna the Great! Without impairing faith, without impairing riches, he subdued in a moment the niggardly treasurer, made him self-denying, conveyed him to Jetavana, causing him to take his cakes with him, set him face to face with the Teacher, and established him in the Fruit of Conversion. Oh, how great is the supernatural power of the Elder!” Thus, as they sat together in the Hall of Truth, did they praise the virtues of the Elder. By Supernatural Audition the Teacher overheard them, and entering the Hall of Truth, asked them, “Monks, what is the subject you are discussing now, as you sit here all gathered together?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, a monk who would convert a household without impairing faith, without impairing riches, without wearying or oppressing that household, must approach that household to make known the virtues of the Buddha as a bee approaches a flower to gather honey therefrom. Such a monk is my son Moggallāna.” And in praise of the Elder he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1318]="***49. Even as a bee, without injuring a flower, or the color, or the scent thereof,*";
P_HTM[1319]="***Gathers the honey, and then flies away, even so should a sage go about village.*";
P_HTM[1320]="***When the Teacher had given this religious instruction, he continued his discourse for the purpose of proclaiming the virtues of the Elder, saying, “Monks, this is not the first time that Treasurer Niggardly has been converted by the Elder Moggallāna. In a previous state of existence also he converted him by teaching him the connection between a deed and the fruit thereof.” And to make the matter clearer he related the Illīsa Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[1321]="***Both are lame, both are bow-legged, both squint,*";
P_HTM[1322]="***Both have a wart. I cannot tell which of them is Illīsa.*";
P_HTM[1323]="*[38] 6. Pāveyyakājīvakavatthu**6. Pāṭhika the Naked Ascetic*";
P_HTM[1324]="***50. Not the faults of others, not things done and left undone by others,*";
P_HTM[1325]="***Only one’s own sins of commission and omission should one regard.*";
P_HTM[1326]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Pāṭhika the Naked Ascetic.*";
P_HTM[1327]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, the wife of a certain householder ministered to the needs of a Naked Ascetic named Pāṭhika, treating him as she would her own son. Of her nearest neighbors, those who went to hear the Teacher preach the Law returned praising the virtues of the Buddhas in manifold ways, saying, “Oh, how wonderful is the preaching of the Buddhas!” When the woman heard her neighbors thus praise the Buddhas, she desired to go to the monastery and hear the Law. So she put the matter to the Naked Ascetic, saying, “Noble sir, I desire to go and hear the Buddha.” But as often as she made her request, the Naked Ascetic dissuaded her from going, saying, “Do not go.” The woman thought to herself, “Since this Naked Ascetic will not permit me to go to the monastery and hear the Law, I will invite the Teacher to my own house and hear the Law right here.”*";
P_HTM[1328]="***Accordingly, when it was evening, she summoned her own son and sent him to the Teacher, saying to him, “Go invite the Teacher to accept my hospitality for to-morrow.” The boy started out, but went first to the place of residence of the Naked Ascetic, saluted him, and sat down. “Where are you going?” asked the Naked Ascetic. “By my mother’s direction I am going to invite the Teacher.” “Do not go to him.” “All very well, but I am afraid of my mother. I am going.” “Let the two of us eat the fine things prepared for him. Do not go.” “No; my mother will give me a scolding.” “Well then, go. But when you go and invite the Teacher, do not say to him, ‘Our house is situated in such and such a place, in such and such a street, and you may reach it by taking such and such a road.’ Instead, act as if you lived near by, and when you leave, run off as if you intended to take a different road, and come back here.”*";
P_HTM[1329]="***The boy listened to the instructions of the Naked Ascetic and then went to the Teacher and delivered the invitation. When he had done everything according to the instructions of the Naked Ascetic, he returned to the latter. Said the Naked Ascetic, “What did you do?” Said the boy, “Everything you told me to do, noble sir.” “You have done very well. Now we shall both of us eat the good things prepared for him.” On the following day, very early in the morning, the Naked Ascetic went to that house, taking the boy with him, and the two sat down together in the back room.*";
P_HTM[1330]="***The neighbors smeared that house with cow-dung, decked it with the five kinds of flowers, including the Lājā flower, and prepared a seat of great price, that the Teacher might sit therein. (Men who are not familiar with the Buddhas know nothing about the preparation of a seat for them. Nor do the Buddhas ever need a guide to direct them on their way. For on the Day of Enlightenment, when they sit under the Bo-tree, causing ten thousand worlds to quake, all paths become plain to them: “This path leads to Hell, this path leads to the World of Beasts, this path leads to the World of Ghosts, this path leads to the World of Men, this path leads to the World of the Gods, this path leads to the Deathless, to Great Nibbāna.” There is never any need of telling them the way to villages, market-towns, or other places.)*";
P_HTM[1331]="***Therefore the Teacher, very early in the morning, took bowl and robe and went straight to the house of the great female lay disciple. She came forth from the house, saluted the Teacher with the Five Rests, escorted him into the house, poured Water of Donation into his right hand, and gave him the choicest of food, both hard and soft. When the Teacher had finished his meal, the female lay disciple, desiring to have him pronounce the words of thanksgiving, took his bowl, and the Teacher with his own sweet voice began the address of thanksgiving. The lay disciple listened to the preaching of the Law and applauded the Teacher, saying, “Well said! well said!”*";
P_HTM[1332]="***The Naked Ascetic, sitting there in the back room, heard the words of applause uttered by the lay disciple as she heard the Teacher preach the Law. Unable to control himself, he remarked, “She is my disciple no longer,” and came out. And he said to the lay disciple, “Hag, you are lost for applauding this man thus.” And he reviled both the female lay disciple and the Teacher in all manner of ways, and then ran off. The lay disciple was so embarrassed by the Naked Ascetic’s insulting words that her mind became completely distraught, and she was unable to concentrate her attention on the Teacher’s discourse. The Teacher asked her, “Lay disciple, are you unable to fix your mind on my discourse?” “Good and Reverend Sir,” she replied, “my mind is completely distraught by the insulting words of this Naked Ascetic.” Said the Teacher, “One should not consider the talk of such a heretic; one should pay no attention to such as he; one should regard only one’s own sins of commission and omission.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1333]="***50. Not the faults of others, not things done and left undone by others,*";
P_HTM[1334]="***Only one’s own sins of commission and omission should one regard.*";

P_HTM[1337]="***So well-spoken words are fruitless to him that doeth them not.*";
P_HTM[1338]="***52. Like a beautiful flower that possesses both color and perfume,*";
P_HTM[1339]="***So well-spoken words are fruitful to him that doeth them.*";
P_HTM[1340]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to the lay disciple Chattapāṇi.*";
P_HTM[1341]="***For at Sāvatthi lived a lay disciple named Chattapāṇi, versed in the Tipiṭaka, enjoying the Fruit of the Second Path. Early one morning, in observance of Fast-day, he went to pay his respects to the Teacher. (For those who enjoy the Fruition of the Second Path and those who are Noble Disciples, by reason of their previous undertaking, do not take upon themselves the obligations of Fast-day. Such persons, solely by virtue of the Path, lead the holy life and eat but one meal a day. Therefore said the Exalted One, “Great king, Ghaṭīkāra the potter eats but one meal a day, leads the holy life, is virtuous and upright.” Thus, as a matter of course, those who enjoy the Fruition of the Second Path eat but one meal a day and lead the holy life.)*";
P_HTM[1342]="***Chattapāṇi also, thus observing Fast-day, approached the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and sat down and listened to the Law. Now at this time King Pasenadi Kosala also came to pay his respects to the Teacher. When Chattapāṇi saw him coming, he reflected, “Shall I rise to meet him or not?” He came to the following conclusion, “Since I am seated in the presence of the King of Kings, I am not called upon to rise on seeing the king of one of his provinces. Even if he becomes angry, I will not rise. For if I rise on seeing the king, the king will be honored, and not the Teacher. Therefore I will not rise.” Therefore Chattapāṇi did not rise. (Wise men never become angry when they see a man remain seated, instead of rising, in the presence of those of higher rank.)*";
P_HTM[1343]="***But when King Pasenadi saw that Chattapāṇi did not rise, his heart was filled with anger. However, he paid obeisance to the Teacher and sat down respectfully on one side. The Teacher, observing that he was angry, said to him, “Great king, this lay disciple Chattapāṇi is a wise man, knows the Law, is versed in the Tipiṭaka, is contented both in prosperity and adversity.” Thus did the Teacher extol the lay disciple’s good qualities. Even as the king listened to the Teacher’s praise of the lay disciple, his heart softened.*";
P_HTM[1344]="***Now one day after breakfast, as the king stood on the upper floor of his palace, he saw the lay disciple Chattapāṇi pass through the courtyard of the royal palace with a parasol in his hand and sandals on his feet. Straightway he caused him to be summoned before him. Chattapāṇi laid aside his parasol and sandals, approached the king, paid obeisance to him, and took his stand respectfully on one side. Said the king to Chattapāṇi, “Lay disciple, why did you lay aside your parasol and sandals?” “When I heard the words, ‘The king summons you,’ I laid aside my parasol and sandals before coming into his presence.” “Evidently, then, you have to-day learned that I am king.” “I always knew that you were king.” “If that be true, then why was it that the other day, when you were seated in the presence of the Teacher and saw me, you did not rise?”*";
P_HTM[1345]="***“Great king, had I, seated in the presence of the King of Kings, risen on seeing a king of one of his provinces, I should have shown disrespect for the Teacher. Therefore did I not rise.” “Very well, let bygones be bygones. I am told that you are well versed in matters pertaining to the present world and the world to come; that you are versed in the Tipiṭaka. Recite the Law in our women’s quarters.” “I cannot, your majesty.” “Why not?” “A king’s house is subject to severe censure. Improper and proper alike are grave matters in this case, your majesty.” “Say not so. The other day, when you saw me, you saw fit not to rise. Do not add insult to injury.” “Your majesty, it is a censurable act for householders to go about performing the functions of monks. Send for someone who is a monk and ask him to recite the Law.”*";
P_HTM[1346]="***The king dismissed him, saying, “Very well, sir, you may go.” Having so done, he sent a messenger to the Teacher with the following request, “Reverend Sir, my consorts Mallikā and Vāsabhakhattiyā say, ‘We desire to master the Law.’ Therefore pray come to my house regularly with five hundred monks and preach the Law to them.” The Teacher sent the following reply, “Great king, it is impossible for the Buddhas to go regularly to any one place.” “In that case, Reverend Sir, send some monk.” The Teacher assigned the duty to the Elder Ānanda. And the Elder came regularly and recited the Ordinances to those queens. Of the two queens, Mallikā learned thoroughly, rehearsed faithfully, and heeded her teacher’s instruction. But Vāsabhakhattiyā did not learn thoroughly, nor did she rehearse faithfully, nor was she able to master the instruction she received.*";
P_HTM[1347]="***One day the Teacher asked the Elder Ānanda, “Ānanda, are your female lay disciples mastering the Law?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Which one learns thoroughly?” “Reverend Sir, Mallikā learns thoroughly, rehearses faithfully, and can understand thoroughly the instruction she receives. But your kinswoman does not learn thoroughly, nor does she rehearse faithfully, nor can she understand thoroughly the instruction she receives.” When the Teacher heard the Elder’s reply, he said, “Ānanda, as for the Law I have preached, to one who is not faithful in hearing, learning, rehearsing, and preaching it, it is profitless, like a flower that possesses color but lacks perfume. But to one who is faithful in hearing, learning, rehearsing and preaching the Law, it returns abundant fruit and manifold blessings.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1348]="***51. Like a beautiful flower that possesses color but lacks perfume,*";
P_HTM[1349]="***So well-spoken words are fruitless to him that doeth them not.*";
P_HTM[1350]="***52. Like a beautiful flower that possesses both color and perfume,*";
P_HTM[1351]="***So well-spoken words are fruitful to him that doeth them.*";
P_HTM[1352]="***At the conclusion of the lesson many attained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths. The lesson was of benefit to the multitude.*";

P_HTM[1354]="***53. Even as from a heap of flowers a man may make many garlands,*";
P_HTM[1355]="***Even so he that is born a mortal man should perform many good deeds.*";
P_HTM[1356]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Pubbārāma near Sāvatthi with reference to the female lay disciple Visākhā.*";
P_HTM[1357]="***Visākhā, we are told, was born in the city of Bhaddiya in the kingdom of Aṅga. Her father was Treasurer Dhanañjaya, son of Treasurer Ram, and her mother was Sumanā Devī, his chief consort. When Visākhā was but seven years old, the Teacher, perceiving that the Brahman Sela and other of his kinsmen in the faith possessed the faculties requisite for Conversion, set out with a great company of monks and came to that city. Now at this time householder Ram held the post of treasurer in that city, being the chief of five persons of great merit.*";
P_HTM[1358]="***(The five persons of great merit were Treasurer Ram, Candapadumā his chief consort, his eldest son Dhanañjaya, his wife Sumanā Devī, and Treasurer Ram’s slave Puṇṇā. Now Treasurer Ram possessed limitless wealth, but he was not the only possessor of limitless wealth. In the country over which King Bimbisāra ruled were five such persons: Jotiya, Jaṭila, Ram, Puṇṇaka, and Kākavaliya.)*";
P_HTM[1359]="***When Treasurer Ram learned that the Possessor of the Ten Forces had come to his city, he sent for the maiden Visākhā, daughter of Treasurer Dhanañjaya, and said to her, “Dear girl, this is a happy day for you and a happy day for me. Summon the five hundred maidens who are your attendants, mount five hundred chariots, and accompanied by your five hundred slave-maidens, go forth to meet the Possessor of the Ten Forces.” “Very well,” replied Visākhā, promising to do as he said.*";
P_HTM[1360]="***And this she did. Now because she well knew both what was reasonable and what was unreasonable, she proceeded in her carriage as far as there was room for a carriage to go; and then, descending from her carriage, approached the Teacher on foot, paid obeisance to him, and took her stand on one side. Pleased with her deportment, the Teacher preached the Law to her, and at the end of his discourse both she and her five hundred maidens were established in the Fruit of Conversion.*";
P_HTM[1361]="***Treasurer Ram also approached the Teacher, hearkened to the Law, and was established in the Fruit of Conversion. Thereupon Treasurer Ram invited the Teacher to be his guest on the morrow. Accordingly on the following day he entertained in his own house the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, serving them with the choicest food, both hard and soft, and in like manner during the following fortnight provided them with abundant food. When the Teacher had remained in the city of Bhaddiya during his good pleasure, he departed.*";
P_HTM[1362]="***Now at this time Bimbisāra and Pasenadi Kosala were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other. And one day the king of Kosala thought to himself, “In Bimbisāra’s country live five persons of limitless wealth, but in my country lives not a single one. Suppose I were to go to Bimbisāra and ask him to let me have one of his persons of great merit.” Accordingly he went to Bimbisāra, who greeted him in a friendly manner and asked him, “For what purpose have you come?” “I have come with this thought in mind, ‘In your country live five persons of limitless wealth and five persons of great merit. I should like to take one of them back with me.’ ” “These are notable families, and it is impossible for me to move them.” “I will not go back without one.”*";
P_HTM[1363]="***The king took counsel with his ministers and replied, “To move notable families like that of Jotiya would be like moving the earth itself. But there is a treasurer named Dhanañjaya, son of Treasurer Ram. I will take counsel with him and give you my answer later.” So King Bimbisāra caused Treasurer Dhanañjaya to be summoned and said to him, “Dear friend, the king of Kosala has said to me, ‘I wish to take back with me a single treasurer possessed of great wealth.’ You go back with him.” “Your majesty, if you send me, I will go.” “Very well, dear friend, make your preparations and go.”*";
P_HTM[1364]="***So Treasurer Dhanañjaya made the necessary preparations, and the king bestowed high honor upon him and dismissed King Pasenadi, saying, “Take him back with you.” So King Pasenadi took him with him and set out for Sāvatthi, spending a single night on the journey. As they journeyed along, reaching a pleasant place, they pitched camp there for the night. Treasurer Dhanañjaya asked the king, “Whose country is this?” “This is my country, treasurer.” “How far is it from here to Sāvatthi?” “Seven leagues.” “The interior of the city is crowded, and my retinue is a large one. If, your majesty, you approve, we will take up our residence right here.” “Very well,” replied the king, granting his request. So the king created a city for him right there and gave it to him, and having so done, departed. Because this region was first inhabited in the evening (sāyaṁ), it received the name Sāketa. Now there lived at Sāvatthi a treasurer named Migāra, and he had a son named Puṇṇvaddhana, who had just reached manhood. His mother and father said to him, “Dear son, choose for yourself a wife in whatever quarter you please.” “I have no use for anything of the sort.” “Son, do not act in this way. A family without children cannot endure.” After they had spoken to him several times, he said, “Very well. If I can find a maiden endowed with the Five Beauties, I will do as you say.” “But what are these Five Beauties, dear son?” “Beauty of hair, beauty of flesh, beauty of bone, beauty of skin, and beauty of youth.”*";
P_HTM[1365]="***(For in the case of a woman of great merit the hair is like a peacock’s tail, and when it is released and allowed to fall, it touches the hem of her skirt, and then the ends of the hair curl and turn upwards. This is Beauty of Hair. Her lips have a color like that of a bright red gourd and are even and soft to the touch. This is Beauty of Flesh. Her teeth are white and even and without interstices and shine like a row of diamonds set upright or like an evenly cut conch-shell. This is Beauty of Bone. Her skin, without the use of sandal-wood or rouge or any other cosmetic, is as smooth as a garland of water-lilies and as white as a garland of kaṇikāra flowers. This is Beauty of Skin. Though she has brought forth ten times, her youth is just as fresh as though she had brought forth but once. This is Beauty of Youth.)*";
P_HTM[1366]="***So Puṇṇvaddhana’s mother and father invited a hundred and eight Brahmans to their house, entertained them at dinner, and then asked them, “Are there any women who are endowed with the Five Beauties?” “Indeed there are.” “Well then, let eight of you go in search of such a maiden,” said they, giving the Brahmans much money. “And when you return, we will do for you what is right. Go seek out such a maiden, and when you find her, deck her with this garland.” So saying, they gave the Brahmans a golden garland worth a hundred thousand pieces of money and dismissed them. The Brahmans went to all the great cities and searched diligently, but finding no maiden endowed with the Five Beauties, turned back. Returning to Sāketa, they reached the city on Public Day and thought to themselves, “To-day our labors will reach a successful termination.”*";
P_HTM[1367]="***Now in this city there is a festival celebrated every year called Public Day, and on this day families which do not ordinarily go out come forth from their houses with their attendants and, with their persons unclothed, go on foot to the bank of the river. Moreover, on this day sons of men of wealth and position of the Warrior caste stand along the road, and when they see a beautiful maiden of equal birth with themselves, throw a wreath of flowers over her head.*";
P_HTM[1368]="***The Brahmans also went to the bank of the river, entered a certain hall, and waited. At that moment Visākhā, who was now about fifteen or sixteen years of age, adorned with all her adornments, accompanied by five hundred young women, came to the bank of the river, intending to bathe therein. Suddenly a storm came up and it began to rain. Thereupon the five hundred maidens ran as fast as they could and entered the hall. But in spite of the rain Visākhā proceeded at her usual gait. When she entered the hall, her garments and jewels were wet.*";
P_HTM[1369]="***The Brahmans perceived that she possessed four of the Beauties. Desiring to see her teeth, they began saying to each other, “Our daughter has a slothful nature. Her husband will not get so much as sour rice-gruel to eat, or we are sorely mistaken!” Then said Visākhā to the Brahmans, “What are you saying?” “We were speaking of you, dear girl.” (They say that her voice was soft and resonant like the tones of a bell.) Then, with her soft, resonant voice, she asked them again, “What was the subject of your conversation?”*";
P_HTM[1370]="***“We were saying that while the young women who are your attendants ran as fast as they could and entered the hall without wetting their garments and their jewels, you did not quicken your pace at all, although it was but a short distance you had to go, and entered the hall with your garments and jewels wet.” “Dear friends, do not speak thus. I am stronger than they are. Moreover, I had good reason for not quickening my pace.” “What was the reason, dear girl?”*";
P_HTM[1371]="***“Dear friends, there are four persons who do not appear to advantage while running; and there is another reason besides.” “Dear girl, which are the four persons that do not appear to advantage while running?” “Dear friends, an anointed king does not appear to advantage if, adorned with all his jewels, he girds up his loins and runs in the palace-court. By so doing he will certainly incur unfavorable criticism, and people will say of him, ‘Why is this great king running about like a common householder?’*";
P_HTM[1372]="***“Likewise the king’s state elephant, when fully caparisoned, does not appear to advantage while running; but when he moves with the natural grace of an elephant, he does appear to advantage. A monk does not appear to advantage while running. By so doing he will incur only unfavorable criticism, and people will say of him, ‘Why does this monk run about like a common householder?’ But if he walks at a tranquil gait, he does appear to advantage. A woman does not appear to advantage while running. She will incur only unfavorable criticism, and justly so. People will say of her, ‘Why is this woman running about like a man?’ These are the four persons that do not appear to advantage while running.”*";
P_HTM[1373]="***“But what was the other reason, dear girl?” “Dear friends, mothers and fathers bring up a daughter seeking to preserve intact the greater and lesser members of her body. For we are goods for sale, and they bring us up with the intention of marrying us off into some other family. The result is that were we, while running, to trip over the hem of our skirt or on the ground, and fall and break either a hand or a foot, we should be a burden on our family. But if the clothes we wear get wet, they will dry. Bearing this consideration in mind, dear friends, I did not run.”*";
P_HTM[1374]="***While Visākhā was talking, the Brahmans observed the beauty of her teeth. “Such beautiful teeth as hers we have never seen,” said they. And applauding her, they said, “Dear girl, only you are worthy to receive this.” So saying, they threw the golden garland over her head. Then she asked them, “Dear friends, from what city do you come?” “From Sāvatthi, dear girl.” “What is the name of the treasurer whose household you represent?” “The treasurer’s name is Migāra, dear girl.” “What is the name of his noble son?” “Puṇṇavaddhana Kumāra, dear girl.” “The family is of equal birth with our own,” thought Visākhā.*";
P_HTM[1375]="***So she accepted the proposal and immediately sent the following message to her father, “Let him send us a chariot.” For although when she came thither she came on foot, yet from the moment when the garland was thrown over her head, it was no longer proper for her to go on foot. Daughters of noblemen travel in chariots and the like, while others enter an ordinary carriage or raise a parasol or a palmyra-leaf over their heads; and if this is not to be had, take the skirt of their undergarment and throw it over their shoulder.*";
P_HTM[1376]="***Now her father sent her five hundred chariots, and entering her chariot, she departed with her retinue, the Brahmans accompanying her. The treasurer asked the Brahmans, “Whence have you come?” “From Sāvatthi, great treasurer.” “What is the name of the treasurer?” “The treasurer’s name is Migāra.” “What is the name of his son?” “Puṇṇavaddhana Kumāra.” “How great is his wealth?” “Forty crores, great treasurer.” “As for his wealth, it is but a farthing compared with ours; but from the time when one obtains a protector for his daughter, why should anything else be considered?” So saying, the treasurer gave his consent. And when he had entertained them in his house for two days, bestowing all manner of attentions upon them, he dismissed them.*";
P_HTM[1377]="***The Brahmans returned to Sāvatthi and reported to Treasurer Migāra, “We have found a maiden.” “Whose daughter is she?” “The daughter of Treasurer Dhanañjaya.” Treasurer Migāra thought to himself, “I have obtained the daughter of a notable family, and it behooves me to bring her hither with all speed.” So he informed the king of his intention to go thither. The king thought to himself, “That is the distinguished family I took from King Bimbisāra and settled at Sāketa. I ought to show him every attention.” So he said, “I will go too.” “Very well, your majesty,” replied Treasurer Migāra. So Treasurer Migāra sent the following message to Treasurer Dhanañjaya, “When I come, the king will accompany me, and the king’s force is a large one. Shall you be able or shall you not be able to care for so large a company?” Treasurer Dhanañjaya sent back the following reply, “If ten kings are coming, let them come!”*";
P_HTM[1378]="***Accordingly Treasurer Migāra took with him from that great city all of the inhabitants except so many as were required to guard the houses, and halting half a league from Sāketa, sent the following message to Treasurer Dhanañjaya, “We have arrived.” Thereupon Treasurer Dhanañjaya sent a handsome present to Treasurer Migāra and took counsel with his daughter, saying, “Dear daughter, I am informed that your father-in-law has arrived, and with him the king of Kosala. Which house shall be made ready for him, and which for the king, and which houses for the viceroys?” (The treasurer’s daughter possessed wisdom, and her intelligence was as keen as the edge of a diamond, as the result of the Resolution she had formed and the Earnest Wish she had cherished during a hundred thousand cycles of time.)*";
P_HTM[1379]="***So she made the necessary arrangements, saying, “Make ready such and such a house for my father-in-law, such and such for the king, and such and such for the viceroys.” And causing the slaves and the servants to be summoned, she apportioned to them their several duties, saying, “So many of you are to wait upon the king and so many upon the viceroys; and so many of you as are hostlers and the like are to care for the elephants and horses and other animals, so that when our guests arrive, they may enjoy this festive occasion to the full.” (Why did she take it upon herself to do this? So that none might say, “We came to take part in the festivities of Visākhā’s marriage, but obtained no enjoyment; instead, we spent our time looking after our horses and the like.”)*";
P_HTM[1380]="***On that very day also Visākhā’s father caused five hundred goldsmiths to be summoned and said to them, “Make for my daughter a great-creeper-parure.” So saying, he gave them a thousand nikkhas of ruddy gold and a sufficient supply of silver, rubies, pearls, coral, and diamonds to go with it.*";
P_HTM[1381]="***After the king had remained a few days, he sent the following message to Treasurer Dhanañjaya, “The treasurer must not think of providing maintenance and support for us for long. Let him inform us when the maiden is to depart.” The treasurer sent back the following message to the king, “The season of the rains has now arrived; therefore it will be impossible for you to move for four months. Whatever your army requires, all this it shall be my duty to provide. The king will depart when I send him.” From that time on it was like one long holiday in the city of Sāketa. From the king to the humblest person, all were adorned with garlands and perfumes and rich apparel, and each thought to himself, “The king is bestowing his attentions on me alone.” In this manner three months passed, but the parure was not yet finished.*";
P_HTM[1382]="***The superintendents of the work came and reported to the treasurer, “Nothing is lacking except that there is not sufficient wood to cook food for the army.” “Friends, go tear down all the ruined elephant-stables and all the dilapidated houses in this city and use them for firewood.” They cooked food with firewood thus obtained for a fortnight, and then came back and reported, “There is no more wood.” “At this time of year it is impossible to procure firewood; therefore open the storehouses where the cloths are kept, take coarse cloths, make wicks of them, soak them in vessels of oil, and thus cook the food.” And this they did for another fortnight.*";
P_HTM[1383]="***Thus four months passed, and the parure was completed. In the making of this parure, four pint-pots of diamonds were used, eleven pint-pots of pearls, twenty-two pint-pots of coral, thirty-three pint-pots of rubies; with these and other of the seven kinds of jewels the parure was completed. Ordinary threads were not used in the making of this parure; the thread work was entirely of silver. It was fastened to the head and extended to the feet. In various places seals of gold and dies of silver were attached to hold it in position. There was one seal on the crown of the head, one on the top of each ear, one at the throat, one on each knee, one at each elbow, one at the waist, and one at the small of the back.*";
P_HTM[1384]="***In the fabric of this parure the goldsmiths wrought a peacock; in its right wing were five hundred feathers of ruddy gold, and in its left wing five hundred. Its beak was of coral, its eyes were of gems, and likewise its neck and its tail-feathers; the midribs of the feathers were of precious stones and likewise its legs. When it was placed on the crown of Visākhā’s head, it appeared like a peacock standing on the peak of a mountain and dancing; and the sound of the midribs of the thousand feathers was like the music of the celestial choir or of the five kinds of instruments. Only by going very close could people tell that it was not a real peacock. The materials used in the making of this parure cost nine crores, and a hundred thousand pieces of money were paid for the workmanship.*";
P_HTM[1385]="***(Through what deed in a previous state of existence did Visākhā receive this parure? We are told that in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa she presented twenty thousand monks with bowls and robes, and that she likewise gave them thread and needles and dyeing materials, all of which were her property. It was through this gift of robes that she received this parure. The gift of robes by women culminates in the great-creeper-parure, the gift of robes by men culminates in the reception of bowls and robes supernaturally created.)*";
P_HTM[1386]="***When in the course of four months the great treasurer had thus prepared a trousseau for his daughter, he began giving her her dowry. He gave her five hundred carts filled with money, five hundred carts filled with vessels of gold, five hundred filled with vessels of silver, five hundred filled with copper vessels, five hundred carts filled with garments made of various kinds of silk, five hundred carts filled with ghee, five hundred filled with rice husked and winnowed, and five hundred carts filled with plows, plowshares, and other farm implements.*";
P_HTM[1387]="***This, we are told, was the thought that occurred to him, “In the place to which my daughter is going, she must never be obliged to send to her neighbor and say, ‘I have need of this or that.’ ” For this reason, therefore, he provided her with all these implements. Then he provided her with slave-maidens richly dressed and adorned to wait upon her person, bringing up five hundred carts and placing three slave-maidens in each cart and saying to them, “You are to bathe her and feed her and dress her.” Thus he gave her fifteen hundred slave-maidens to wait upon her person.*";
P_HTM[1388]="***Then the following thought occurred to him, “I will give my daughter cattle.” So he gave the following order to his men, “My men, go to the small cattle-pen and open the gate. When you have so done, post yourselves on both sides of a lane three-quarters of a league in length and eight rods across, with a drum at every quarter-league, and do not allow the cattle to pass beyond these limits. When you have taken up your positions, sound your drums.”*";
P_HTM[1389]="***His men did as they were commanded. Leaving the cattle-pen, they proceeded a quarter of a league and sounded the drum; then proceeding to the half-league point, they sounded the drum; then proceeding to the three-quarter-league point, they sounded the drum; and they guarded the means of exit along the sides. When they had so done, cattle filled an inclosure three-quarters of a league in length and eight rods across and stood rubbing shoulder with shoulder.*";
P_HTM[1390]="***Then the great treasurer ordered the gate of the cattle-pen to be closed, saying, “These cattle are enough for my daughter. Close the gate.” But even after the gate had been closed, by the fruit of Visākhā’s merit, the powerful bulls and milch-cows leaped over the gate and got out. Indeed, in spite of all that the men could do to prevent them, sixty thousand powerful bulls and sixty thousand milch-cows escaped, powerful bull-calves following the milch-cows out of the inclosure.*";
P_HTM[1391]="***(Through what deed in a previous state of existence did the cattle thus come forth? We are told that, in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, Visākhā was reborn as Saṅghadāsī, the youngest of seven daughters of King Kiki. One day, as she was giving the five products of the cow to a company of twenty thousand monks, the young monks and novices covered their bowls with their hands and said, “Enough! enough!” But in spite of their efforts to prevent her, she continued to give, saying, “This is pleasant to the taste, this will rejoice the heart.” As the result of this deed, we are told, the cattle escaped in spite of all that the men could do to prevent them.)*";
P_HTM[1392]="***After the treasurer had given all this wealth to his daughter, his wife said to him, “You have provided all else for your daughter, but you have not provided men-servants and women-servants to do her bidding. Why is this?” “Because I wish to find out which of them have a sincere affection for my daughter and which of them have not. It is not my intention to seize by the neck and send with her those who do not wish to go with her. But when she has entered her carriage and is ready to start, then I will say, ‘Let those who wish to go with her go; let those who do not wish to go with her remain behind.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1393]="***“On the morrow my daughter will depart,” thought the treasurer as he sat in his inner room. So he summoned his daughter, seated her beside him, and said to her, “Dear daughter, there are certain modes of conduct which you must observe so long as you live with your husband’s family.” And so saying, he gave her certain admonitions. Now Treasurer Migāra happened to be sitting in the next room and heard all the admonitions which Treasurer Dhanañjaya gave to his daughter. And these were the admonitions which Treasurer Dhanañjaya gave to his daughter:*";
P_HTM[1394]="***“Dear daughter, so long as you live in the house of your father-in-law, the indoor fire is not to be carried outside; the outdoor fire is not to be carried inside; give only to him that gives; give not to him that gives not; give both to him that gives and to him that gives not; sit happily; eat happily; sleep happily; tend the fire; honor the household divinities.”*";
P_HTM[1395]="***These Ten Admonitions did Treasurer Dhanañjaya give to his daughter. On the following day he assembled all the guilds of artisans and standing in the midst of the king’s army, appointed eight householders to be sponsors for his daughter, saying to them, “If in the place to which my daughter is going, any fault is charged against my daughter, you are to clear her of the charge.”*";
P_HTM[1396]="***Then he caused his daughter to put on her great-creeper-parure which cost nine crores of treasure, and giving her fifty-four crores of treasure to buy aromatic powders for the bath, he assisted her to enter her carriage. And escorting her through the fourteen villages round about Sāketa which paid tribute to him as far as Anurādhapura, he caused the following proclamation to be made, “Let those who wish to go with my daughter go.”*";
P_HTM[1397]="***So soon as the inhabitants of the fourteen villages heard this proclamation, they exclaimed, “Why should we remain here when our noble mistress is departing?” And they, departed from those villages, leaving nothing behind them. Treasurer Dhanañjaya paid his respects to the king and Treasurer Migāra, accompanied them a little way on their journey, and then bidding farewell to his daughter, placed her in their charge.*";
P_HTM[1398]="***When Treasurer Migāra, seated in the last carriage in the procession, saw the army of people following, he asked, “Who are these people?” “Men-servants and women-servants to do your daughter-in-law’s bidding.” “Who can feed so many as these? Beat them with sticks and drive them back. Take along only those who will not be driven back.” But Visākhā protested, saying, “Hold! do not drive them away. One army will feed the other.” Said the treasurer in reply to her protests, “Dear girl, we have no need of these people. Who will feed them?” And he had them beaten with clods of earth, sticks, and the like and driven back. And taking with him those who would not be driven back, he said, “These are enough for our purposes,” and continued his journey.*";
P_HTM[1399]="***Now when Visākhā reached the gate of the city of Sāvatthi, she thought to herself, “Shall I enter the city sitting in a closed carriage or standing up in a chariot?” Thereupon the following thought occurred to her, “If I enter the city sitting in a closed carriage, the splendor and magnificence of my great-creeper-parure will be visible to none.” Accordingly she entered the city standing up in a chariot, showing herself to all the city. When the residents of Sāvatthi beheld Visākhā’s state, they said, “This, they say, is Visākhā, and her state well becomes her.” Such was the splendid state in which Visākhā entered the treasurer’s house.*";
P_HTM[1400]="***On the day when Visākhā entered the city of Sāvatthi, all the residents of the city said to themselves, “Treasurer Dhanañjaya was most hospitable to us when we visited his city.” Therefore they sent presents to Visākhā according to their power and ability. And all the presents which were sent to her Visākhā distributed among the various families throughout the city. “Give this to my mother,” she would say; “this to my father, this to my brother, this to my sister.” Thus she accompanied every gift she sent with a kindly message to the recipient, choosing her words with reference to the age and station of each and adopting, as it were, all the residents of the city as her kinsfolk.*";
P_HTM[1401]="***Now in the middle of the night Visākhā’s well-bred mare gave birth to a foal. Accordingly Visākhā went to the stable, accompanied by her female slaves bearing torches in their hands, saw that the mare was bathed with hot water and anointed with oil, and having so done, returned to her own quarters.*";
P_HTM[1402]="***Now Treasurer Migāra, in planning the festivities of his son’s marriage, completely ignored the Tathāgata, in spite of the fact that the Teacher was at that time in residence at a monastery close at hand. On the other hand, impelled by the friendly feeling which he had long cherished for the Naked Ascetics, he said to himself, “I will render honor to my noble ascetics.” So one day he ordered the finest of rice-porridge to be boiled in hundreds of new vessels, invited five hundred Naked Ascetics, escorted them into his house, and having so done, sent the following message to Visākhā, “Let my daughter-in-law come and render homage to the Arahats.”*";
P_HTM[1403]="***Now Visākhā had attained the Fruit of Conversion and was one of the Noble Disciples, and therefore she was pleased and delighted when she heard the word “Arahats.” But when she entered the hall where the Naked Ascetics were eating and looked at them, she said, “Men like these are totally bereft of sense of modesty and fear of mortal sin and have no right to the title ‘Arahats.’ Why did my father-in-law send for me to come?” And reproaching the treasurer, she returned to her own quarters.*";
P_HTM[1404]="***When the Naked Ascetics saw Visākhā, they all reproached the treasurer with one accord, saying, “Householder, why did you not seek some other maiden to be the wife of your son? In admitting a female lay disciple of the monk Gotama to your house, you have admitted a Jonah of Jonahs. Expel her from this house immediately.” But Treasurer Migāra thought to himself, “It is impossible for me to expel her from my house on the mere say-so of these ascetics; she is the daughter of a great house.” Accordingly he said to the Naked Ascetics, “Noble ascetics, young women are likely to do all sorts of things, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Hold your peace.” So saying, he dismissed them. Having so done, he seated himself on a costly seat and began to eat rich rice-porridge flavored with honey out of a golden dish.*";
P_HTM[1405]="***At this time a monk who was a pellet-faller, going his round for alms, entered the treasurer’s residence. Visākhā stood fanning her father-in-law. When she saw the monk, thinking to herself, “It would not be proper for me to announce this monk to my father-in-law,” she stepped aside, that her father-in-law might see the Elder. But the simpleton, although he saw the Elder, pretended not to see him and with bowed head continued to eat his meal. Visākhā perceived within herself, “Although my father-in-law sees the Elder, yet he makes no sign.” Accordingly she said to the Elder, “Pass on, Reverend Sir. My father-in-law is eating stale fare.”*";
P_HTM[1406]="***Now although Treasurer Migāra had resisted the importunities of the Naked Ascetics, yet when, as he sat there, he heard her say, “He is eating stale fare,” he removed his hand from the dish and said, “Take away this rice-porridge and expel the woman from this house. To think that at a time of festivity she should accuse such a man as I am of eating unclean food!” But in this house all the slaves and servants belonged to Visākhā. Who, therefore, would take hold of her hands and her feet? There was no one who dared even open his mouth.*";
P_HTM[1407]="***Visākhā, hearing the words which her father-in-law had uttered, said, “Dear father-in-law, this is no sufficient reason why I should leave your house. It is not as if I were a common wench brought hither by you from some bathing-place on the river. Daughters who have mothers and fathers living do not leave the house of their father-in-law for any such reason as this. Indeed, for this very reason, when I set out to come hither, my father summoned eight householders and placed me in their hands and said, ‘If any fault is charged against my daughter, you are to clear her of the charge.’ Send, therefore, for my sponsors and let them clear me of the charge.”*";
P_HTM[1408]="***“What she says is right,” said the treasurer. Accordingly he summoned the eight householders and said to them, “At a time of festivity, while I was sitting and eating rich rice-porridge out of a golden dish, this young woman said that I was eating unclean food. Convict her of this charge and expel her from this house.” “Is what he says true, dear girl?”*";
P_HTM[1409]="***“I did not say precisely that. What happened was this: A certain monk going his round for ahns stopped at the door of the house, and my father-in-law, who at the time was eating rich rice-porridge flavored with honey, completely ignored him. I thought to myself, ‘My father-in-law is acquiring no fresh merit in his present state of existence, but is consuming only stale merit.’ So I said to the Elder, ‘Pass on, Reverend Sir. My father-in-law is eating stale fare.’ What fault is to be found with me for so doing?” “None at all. What our daughter said was entirely proper. Why should you get angry with her?”*";
P_HTM[1410]="***“Noble sirs, I grant that there is no fault to be found with her for this. But on a certain occasion, in the middle watch of the night, she went behind the house accompanied by her slaves, both male and female.” “Is what he says true, dear girl?” “Dear friends, my reason for going was no other than this: My full-blooded mare had given birth to a foal in the stable attached to the house. I thought to myself, ‘It is not right that I should sit here and make no sign.’ So I ordered my slaves to procure torches, and accompanied by my slaves, both male and female, I went to the stable and saw to it that proper care was given to the mare.” “Noble sir, our daughter does work in your house which is not fit even for female slaves to do. What fault do you find in this?”*";
P_HTM[1411]="***“Noble sirs, I grant that there is no fault to be found with her for this. But when she was on the point of coming here, her father admonished her, giving her Ten Admonitions with a deeply hidden meaning. I do not know what they mean. Let her tell me the meaning of them. For example, her father said to her, ‘The indoor fire is not to be carried outside.’ Pray how could we live without giving fire to the neighbors who live on both sides of us?” “Is what he says true, dear girl?” “Dear friends, that was not my father’s meaning. What he meant was this: ‘Dear daughter, if you see any fault in your father-in-law or in your husband, say nothing about it when you go to this house or to the other house, for there is no fire that may be compared to this fire.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1412]="***“Noble sirs, let this be as it may. But her father said to her, ‘The outdoor fire is not to be carried inside.’ When the fire in the house is extinguished, what else can we do than to bring fire in from without?” “Is what he says true, dear girl?” “Dear friends, that was not my father’s meaning. What he meant was this: ‘If either women or men in your neighbors’ houses speak ill of your father-in-law or of your husband, you must not bring home what you have heard them say and repeat it, saying, “So-and-so said this or that unkind thing about you.” For there is no fire comparable to this fire.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1413]="***Thus she was found free from fault in this matter, and as in this so also in the others. And this is the true meaning of the remaining admonitions: “Give only to him that gives” means that one should give only to those that return borrowed articles. “Give not to him that gives not” means that one should not give to those who do not return borrowed articles. “Give both to him that gives and to him that gives not” means that when poor kinsfolk and friends seek assistance, one should give to them, whether or not they are able to repay.*";
P_HTM[1414]="***“Sit happily” means that when a wife sees her mother-in-law or her father-in-law or her husband, she should stand and not remain sitting. “Eat happily” means that a wife should not eat before her mother-in-law and her father-in-law and her husband have eaten. She should serve them first, and when she is sure that they have had all they care for, then and not until then may she herself eat. “Sleep happily” means that a wife should not go to bed before her mother-in-law and her father-in-law and her husband. She should first perform the major and minor duties which she owes them, and when she has so done, then she may herself lie down to sleep.*";
P_HTM[1415]="***“Tend the fire” means that a wife should regard her mother-in-law and her father-in-law and her husband as a flame of fire or as a serpent-king. “Honor the household divinities” means that a wife should look upon her mother-in-law and her father-in-law and her husband as her divinities.*";
P_HTM[1416]="***When the treasurer had heard this exposition of the meaning of the Ten Admonitions, he sat with bowed head, unable to make answer. Then the householders asked him, “Treasurer, is there any other fault in our daughter?” “Noble sirs, there is not.” “Why then, if she is without fault, do you seek without cause to expel her from your house?” At this point Visākhā said, “Dear friends, although at first it would not have been proper for me to leave at the command of my father-in-law, inasmuch as when I came hither my father placed me in your hands to determine my guilt or my innocence, nevertheless now, seeing that you have found me free from fault, it is entirely proper for me to go.”*";
P_HTM[1417]="***Forthwith she gave orders, “Prepare for my departure my slaves, both male and female, and my carriages and other conveyances.” Thereupon the treasurer detained those householders and said to Visākhā, “Dear daughter-in-law, it was through ignorance that I spoke. Pardon me.” “Dear father in-law, I pardon you freely so far as in me lies. But I am the daughter of a house which has firm faith in the Religion of the Buddha, and we cannot exist without the Congregation of Monks. If I may be permitted to minister to the Congregation of Monks, according to my inclination, I will remain.” “Dear daughter-in-law, you may minister to your monks to your heart’s content.”*";
P_HTM[1418]="***Visākhā caused an invitation to be sent to the Possessor of the Ten Forces, and on the following day entertained him in her house. The Naked Ascetics also, hearing that the Teacher was going to the house of Treasurer Migāra, went and sat down in a circle about the house. When Visākhā had given Water of Donation to the Teacher, she sent the following message to her father-in-law, “The feast is all ready. Let my father-in-law come and wait upon the Possessor of the Ten Forces.” Now Treasurer Migāra desired to go, but the Naked Ascetics dissuaded him, saying, “Householder, do not think of going to the monk Gotama.” So he sent back the following message, “Let my daughter-in-law herself wait upon him alone.”*";
P_HTM[1419]="***When Visākhā had served the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha with food, and the meal was over, she sent a second message to her father-in-law, “Let my father-in-law come and hear the Teacher preach the Law.” Thought the treasurer, “It would be highly improper for me not to go now,” and desiring greatly to hear the Law, he set out. Thereupon the Naked Ascetics addressed him a second time, saying, “Well then, if you are determined to hear the monk Gotama, sit outside of a curtain and listen.” And preceding him, they drew a curtain around. The treasurer went and sat outside of the curtain.*";
P_HTM[1420]="***Then said the Teacher, “You may sit beyond a curtain or beyond a wall or beyond a mountain, or you may even sit beyond the range of mountains that encircles the earth; I am the Buddha, and I can make you hear my voice.” And as though seizing and shaking great trunks of rose-apple trees or causing ambrosial rain to fall, he began to preach the Law in orderly sequence. Now when a Supreme Buddha preaches the Law, they that stand before and they that stand behind, they that stand beyond a hundred Cakkavāḷas or a thousand Cakkavāḷas, and they that stand in the Abode of the Sublime Gods say, “The Teacher is looking at me alone; he is preaching the Law to me alone.” For the Teacher appears to be looking at each individual and to be conversing with each individual. The Buddhas are said to be like the moon. For as the moon in mid-heaven appears to all beings alike, so that each individual thinks, “The moon is over me, the moon is over me,” so also the Buddhas appear to stand face to face with each individual, no matter where that individual may stand. This is said to be the fruit of their generosity in cutting off their gloriously adorned heads, gouging out their anointed eyes, uprooting the flesh of their hearts, and giving to be the slaves of others sons like Jali, daughters like Kaṇhājina, and wives like Maddī.*";
P_HTM[1421]="***As Treasurer Migāra, sitting outside of the curtain, turned over in his mind the teaching of the Tathāgata, he became established in the Fruit of Conversion in a thousand ways adorned, and became endowed with unwavering belief, and acquired firm faith in the Three Refuges. And lifting the hem of the curtain, he went forwards, and taking in his mouth the breast of his daughter-in-law, he adopted her as his mother, saying, “To-day henceforth you are my mother.” And thenceforth she was called Mother of Migāra. Later on, when she had a son, she gave him the name Migāra. Then the great treasurer, letting go the breast of his daughter-in-law, went to the Exalted One, fell at his feet, stroked his feet with his hands and covered them with kisses, and thrice called out his own name, saying, “I am Migāra, Reverend Sir.” Then he said, “Reverend Sir, all this time I have not known the abundant fruit of alms given to you, but now, through my daughter-in-law, I have come to know of it and have obtained release from all the suffering of the states of punishment. When my daughter-in-law came to my house, she came for my welfare and salvation.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1422]="***To-day I know where given alms yield abundant fruit;*";
P_HTM[1423]="***For my welfare indeed my excellent daughter-in-law came to my house.*";
P_HTM[1424]="***Visākhā invited the Teacher for the following day, and on the following day her mother-in-law attained the Fruit of Conversion. And from that time on that house kept open door for the Religion of the Buddha.*";
P_HTM[1425]="***Then the treasurer thought to himself, “My daughter-in-law has done me a great service. I will make her a present. Now her great-creeper-parure is so heavy that it is impossible for her to wear it all the time. I will therefore have a light parure made for her which she can wear both by day and by night in all the four postures.” Accordingly at a cost of a hundred thousand pieces of money he had a parure made for her called the solid polished parure, and when this was completed, invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and gave them a bountiful feast. Then he caused Visākhā to bathe herself in sixteen water-pots of perfumed water and to put on the solid polished parure. And when she had so done, he caused her to take her stand before the Teacher and to pay obeisance to the Teacher. Then the Teacher pronounced the words of thanksgiving and went back to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[1426]="***Thenceforth Visākhā gave alms, performed the other works of merit, and obtained the Eight Boons from the Teacher. And even as the crescent moon waxes great in the sky, even so did Visākhā wax great with sons and daughters. It is said that she had ten sons and ten daughters, and that each of these had ten sons and ten daughters, and that each of these had ten sons and ten daughters. Thus the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren in the line of direct descent from her numbered eight thousand four hundred and twenty persons. She herself lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, and yet there was not a single gray hair in her head; she always seemed to be about sixteen years old.*";
P_HTM[1427]="***When people saw her on her way to the monastery, surrounded by her children and grandchildren, there were always those who would ask, “Which of these is Visākhā?” When they saw her coming, they would think to themselves, “Let her walk a little way farther; our mistress looks well when she walks.” And when they saw her sitting or lying down, they would think to themselves, “Let her lie a little longer; our mistress looks well when she is lying down.” Thus there was no one who could ever say, “She does not look well in any of the four postures.”*";
P_HTM[1428]="***Moreover, she had the strength of five elephants. Once upon a time the king, who had heard that Visākhā possessed the strength of five elephants, resolved to test her. So on his way back from the monastery, to which he had gone to listen to the Law, he released an elephant against her. The elephant lifted up his trunk and made straight for Visākhā. Of the five hundred women who accompanied her, some fled in terror, while others threw their arms about her. “What does this mean?” asked Visākhā.*";
P_HTM[1429]="***“Noble mistress,” they replied, “they say that the king desires to test your strength and has therefore released an elephant against you.” When Visākhā saw the elephant, she thought to herself, “Why should I flee? How now shall I take hold of him? If I grasp him firmly, I may kill him.” So taking his trunk between two of her fingers, she forced him back. The elephant, unable to resist her strength and to keep his footing, fell back on his haunches in the royal court. Thereupon the populace applauded her, and she returned home with her retinue in safety.*";
P_HTM[1430]="***Now at this time, at Sāvatthi, Visākhā Mother of Migāra had many children and many grandchildren and many great-grandchildren. And her children were free from sickness and her grandchildren were free from sickness and her great-grandchildren were free from sickness, and she was considered to bring good luck. And of all her many thousand children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, not one had as yet met death. On festivals and holidays the residents of Sāvatthi always invited Visākhā first to their feasts.*";
P_HTM[1431]="***Now on a certain festive occasion, as the multitude, richly dressed and adorned, were on their way to the monastery to listen to the Law, Visākhā also, after eating in the house to which she had been invited, put on her great-creeper-parure and accompanied the multitude to the monastery. And taking off her ornaments, she gave them to her slave-girl, even as it is said:*";
P_HTM[1432]="***Now at this time there was a festival at Sāvatthi, and the people, richly dressed and adorned, went to the Grove; and Visākhā Mother of Migāra, richly dressed and adorned, also went to the monastery. And Visākhā Mother of Migāra took off her ornaments, and wrapping them in her cloak, gave them to her slave-girl, saying, “Ho! take this bundle.”*";
P_HTM[1433]="***It is said that, as she was on her way to the monastery, she thought to herself, “It is not fitting that I should enter the monastery covered with jewels, wearing on my person a parure so costly as this, extending from head to foot.” Therefore removing her parure, she made a bundle of it and placed it in the hands of her slave-girl, who alone could carry it, possessing as she did the strength of five elephants acquired by her own merit. Therefore she said to her, “Dear girl, take this parure. When I return from the Teacher’s sermon, I will put it on again.” And when she had given the parure to her slave-girl, she put on her solid polished parure, and approaching the Teacher, listened to the Law. At the end of the sermon she saluted the Exalted One, rose from her seat, and went out. Her slave-girl, who had forgotten the parure, accompanied her.*";
P_HTM[1434]="***Now it was the custom of Elder Ānanda, after the congregation had departed from listening to the Law, in case anything had been forgotten and left behind, to put it away. So on this particular day, seeing the great-creeper-parure, he told the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, Visākhā has gone away and forgotten her parure.” “Put it aside, Ānanda.” So the Elder took it up and hung it beside the staircase. Visākhā thought to herself, “I will find out what medicines and other requisites are needed by the monks who are coming and going and who are sick or in need.” And for the purpose of providing for them she made the rounds of the monastery with Suppiyā.*";
P_HTM[1435]="***Now whenever the young monks and novices saw these two female lay disciples going the rounds of the monastery, those who had need of ghee and honey and oil and the other requisites used to take their bowls and other vessels and come up to them. And on this day they followed their usual practice. Suppiyā, seeing a certain sick monk, asked him, “What does my noble master require?” “Meat-broth.” “Very well, noble sir, I will see that it is sent to you.” So on the following day, obtaining no suitable meat with which to make the broth, she cut flesh from her own thigh. Through her faith in the Teacher her body was made whole.*";
P_HTM[1436]="***When Visākhā had attended all the sick monks and all the young monks and novices, she went out by another door. Stopping at the approach to the monastery, she said to her slave-girl, “Dear girl, bring me my parure. I should like to put it on.” At that moment the slave-girl reflected that she had forgotten to bring it with her when she came out. So she replied, “Noble mistress, I forgot to bring it with me.” “Well then, go back and get it. But in case my noble Elder Ānanda has taken it up and put it away, do not bring it to me. In that case I give it freely to my noble Elder.” Now Visākhā knew in her heart, “It is the practice of the Elder to put away articles that have been forgotten and left behind by persons of consequence.” It was for this reason that she said this.*";
P_HTM[1437]="***When the Elder saw the slave-girl, he asked her, “For what purpose have you returned?” The slave-girl replied, “When I went away I forgot to take with me the parure which belongs to my noble mistress.” “I hung it by the staircase. Go get it.” But the slave-girl replied, “Noble sir, nothing that has been touched by your hand may be removed by my noble mistress.” And filled with joy and delight, she returned to her mistress. “What about it?” asked Visākhā. The slave-girl told her the whole story. “Dear girl,” said Visākhā, “I will wear nothing that has been touched by my noble master. I give it to him freely. But the parure will be a troublesome thing for my noble masters to take care of. I will therefore sell it and give my noble masters the equivalent of the money it brings. Go fetch it hither.” So the slave-girl went and brought back the parure.*";
P_HTM[1438]="***Visākhā did not put on the parure, but sent for goldsmiths and had it appraised. The goldsmiths reported, “The parure is worth nine crores, and the workmanship is worth a hundred thousand.” So Visākhā caused the parure to be placed in a cart and said, “Very well, sell it.” But there was no one who could have bought it at that price. (Women who are able to wear the great-creeper-parure are hard to find. Indeed on the whole circle of the earth there are but three women who have obtained the great-creeper-parure: the eminent female lay disciple Visākhā, the wife of Bandhula king of the Mallas, and Mallikā daughter of the treasurer of Benāres.)*";
P_HTM[1439]="***Therefore Visākhā herself alone gave the price for it, and causing the nine crores of treasure and a hundred thousand additional to be placed in a cart, she caused it to be conveyed to the monastery. Then she saluted the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, this thought has been in my mind: ‘My noble master. Elder Ānanda, touched with his hand my golden-creeper-parure, and from the moment he touched it I decided that I could no longer wear it. Therefore I decided to sell it and to give you the purchase-money.’ But when I tried to sell it, I could find no one who was able to buy it, and therefore made up the price for it myself and have brought it to you. Which of the four requisites shall I present to you, Reverend Sir?”*";
P_HTM[1440]="***The Teacher replied, “Visākhā, would it suit you to erect a dwelling-place for the monks at the eastern gate of the monastery?” “That would suit me exactly, Reverend Sir,” replied Visākhā, her heart filled with delight. So for nine crores she bought the site, and with nine crores more began to build a dwelling-place for the monks.*";
P_HTM[1441]="***Now one day, as the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn, he perceived that the faculties requisite for Conversion were possessed by a certain treasurer’s son named Bhaddiya, who, after passing from the World of the Gods, had been reborn in the household of the treasurer of the city of Bhaddiya. Therefore, after eating his breakfast in the house of Anāthapiṇḍika, he set out for the north gate.*";
P_HTM[1442]="***As a rule, when the Teacher took his meal in the house of Visākhā, he went out by the south gate and resided at the Jetavana; and when he took his meal in the house of Anāthapiṇḍika, he went out by the east gate and resided at Pubbārāma. Therefore, when the people saw the Exalted One going out by the north gate, they knew that he was about to set out on a journey.*";
P_HTM[1443]="***When, therefore, on that day, Visākhā heard that the Teacher was going in the direction of the north gate, she went to him quickly, saluted him, and said, “Reverend Sir, is it your intention to set out on a journey?” “Yes, Visākhā.” “Reverend Sir, I am causing a dwelling-place to be erected for you at an expenditure of all this treasure. Pray turn back, Reverend Sir.” “Visākhā, this is a journey which does not permit of my turning back.”*";
P_HTM[1444]="***Visākhā thought to herself, “Doubtless the Exalted One has good reason for what he is doing.” So she said to the Teacher, “Well then, Reverend Sir, before you depart, direct some monk who knows what should be done and what should not be done to remain behind.” “Visākhā, take the bowl of whatever monk you please.”*";
P_HTM[1445]="***Now although she was especially fond of Elder Ānanda, yet, thinking to herself, “Elder Moggallāna the Great possesses great magical power, and with his assistance my work will be made easy,” she took the bowl of Elder Moggallāna the Great. The Elder looked at the Teacher, and the Teacher said, “Moggallāna, take with you your retinue of five hundred monks and turn back.” The Elder did as he was commanded.*";
P_HTM[1446]="***By the supernatural power of Elder Moggallāna the Great they went fifty or sixty leagues for trees and stones and returned with great trees and stones on the same day. Nor did it tire them to hoist trees and stones on the carts, nor did an axle break, and in but a short time they erected a dwelling-place two stories high. There were five hundred rooms on the ground floor and five hundred rooms on the floor above; thus the dwelling-place contained a thousand rooms in all. The Teacher, after journeying about for nine months, returned to Sāvatthi. In those nine months also the work on Visākhā’s dwelling was completed, and she was building a pinnacle of solid, beaten, ruddy gold, intended to hold sixty water-pots.*";
P_HTM[1447]="***When Visākhā heard that the Teacher was on his way to the Jetavana, she went forth to meet him, and conducting him to the monastery which she was building, exacted the following promise from him, “Reverend Sir, bring the Congregation of Monks here for these four months and take up your residence here, and I will have the dwelling-place for the monks finished.” The Teacher consented to come. Thenceforth she gave alms to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha in that very monastery.*";
P_HTM[1448]="***Now a certain friend of hers came to her with a piece of cloth worth a hundred thousand pieces of money and said to her, “Friend, I should like to spread this small carpet in your dwelling-place. Tell me where I may spread it.” Visākhā replied, “If I say to you, ‘There is no room,’ you will think, ‘She does not wish to give me any space;’ therefore you yourself may look through the two floors and the thousand rooms and see whether there is any place to lay your carpet.” So the woman took the carpet worth a hundred thousand pieces of money and went through the whole dwelling-place. But finding no coverings of less value than her own, she thought to herself, “I shall obtain no merit in the building of this dwelling-place,” and overcome with sadness, stopped in a certain place and stood there weeping.*";
P_HTM[1449]="***Elder Ānanda saw her and asked her, “What are you weeping for?” She told him what was the matter. Said the Elder, “Do not grieve. I will show you where you can spread your carpet. Make of it a mat for the feet and spread it between the foot of the stairs and the place where the monks wash their feet. When the monks bathe their feet, they will first wipe their feet there before going into the monastery. Thus you will earn abundant merit.” It appears that Visākhā had overlooked this place.*";
P_HTM[1450]="***After Visākhā had for four months given alms to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, on the last day she gave cloth for robes to the Congregation of Monks, each novice receiving cloth for robes worth a thousand pieces of money each. Last of all she gave medicines to the monks, filling the bowl of each monk. The treasure she spent in the giving of alms amounted to nine crores. Thus in all she spent twenty-seven crores of treasure in the Religion of the Buddha, nine crores for the site of the monastery, nine crores to build it, and nine crores for alms. No other woman in the world gave away so much money as this woman who lived in the house of a heretic.*";
P_HTM[1451]="***On the day when the monastery was completed and the festival of the opening of the monastery was in progress, as the shadows of evening lengthened, she walked round about the monastery, accompanied by her children and her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. And then she thought within herself, “Now is entirely fulfilled the prayer which I prayed in times of yore.” And in five stanzas, with her sweet voice, she breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance:*";
P_HTM[1452]="***When shall I give the gift of a monastery, a pleasing dwelling-place plastered with cement and mortar? Fulfilled is my desire.*";
P_HTM[1453]="***When shall I give the furnishings of a lodging, beds and chairs and mats and pillows? Fulfilled is my desire.*";
P_HTM[1454]="***When shall I give the gift of food, ticket-food flavored with pure meat-broths? Fulfilled is my desire.*";
P_HTM[1455]="***When shall I give the gift of robes, Benāres cloth, linens and cottons? Fulfilled is my desire.*";
P_HTM[1456]="***When shall I give the gift of medicaments, ghee and butter and honey and oil and jaggery? Fulfilled is my desire.*";
P_HTM[1457]="***The monks, hearing the sound of her voice, said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, during all this time we have never known Visākhā to sing. But to-day, surrounded by her children and her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren, she is going round and round the monastery singing. Is her bile out of order or has she gone mad?” The Teacher replied, “Monks, my daughter is not singing. But her Earnest Wish is now fulfilled, and her heart is filled with joy at the thought, ‘The prayer I prayed is now fulfilled,’ and she is breathing forth a Solemn Utterance as she walks about.” “But, Reverend Sir, when was it that she prayed this prayer?” “Do you wish to hear, monks?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, we wish to hear.” Thereupon the Teacher told them the following*";
P_HTM[1458]="***8 a. Story of the Past: Visākhā’s Earnest Wish*";
P_HTM[1459]="***Monks, a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past, a Buddha named Padumuttara appeared in the world. The term of his life was a hundred thousand years, his retinue of Arahats numbered a hundred thousand, his city was named Haṁsavatī, his father was Sunanda, and his mother was Sujātā Devī. The female lay disciple who was his principal benefactress obtained from him the Eight Boons, and standing in the relation of a mother to him, provided the Teacher with the Four Requisites, going to wait upon him both in the evening and in the morning. Now she had a friend who invariably accompanied her to the monastery, and when this friend observed how intimately she conversed with the Teacher and how she was beloved by the Teacher, she considered within herself, “By what means may women become thus beloved of the Buddhas?”*";
P_HTM[1460]="***So one day she asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, in what relation does this woman stand to you?” “She is the chief of my benefactresses.” “Reverend Sir, by what means may women become the chief benefactresses of the Buddhas?” “By making an Earnest Wish for a hundred thousand cycles of time.” “Reverend Sir, would it be possible for a woman to attain this position by making an Earnest Wish at this moment?” “Yes, that would be possible.” “Well then, Reverend Sir, accept food at my hands for seven days with your hundred thousand monks.” The Teacher consented to do so.*";
P_HTM[1461]="***So for seven days she gave alms to the Teacher. On the last day, taking the Teacher’s bowl and robe, she saluted the Teacher, and prostrating herself at his feet, made the following Earnest Wish, “Reverend Sir, I seek not through the giving of these alms any such reward as sovereignty over the gods; but may I receive the Eight Boons at the hands of a Buddha like you, may I stand in the relation of a mother to him, and may I be the foremost of the women entitled to provide him with the Four Requisites.”*";
P_HTM[1462]="***Thought the Teacher, “Will her Earnest Wish be fulfilled?” After pondering the future in his mind and surveying a hundred thousand cycles of time, he said to her, “At the end of a hundred thousand cycles of time a Buddha named Gotama will arise in the world. At that time you will be a female lay disciple named Visākhā; you will receive the Eight Boons at his hands, you will stand in the relation of a mother to him, and you will be the foremost of the women entitled to provide him with the Four Requisites.”*";
P_HTM[1463]="***Thus it was inevitable, so to speak, that she should receive this Attainment. After spending the remainder of the term of life allotted to her in the performance of works of merit, she passed out of that state of existence and was reborn in the World of the Gods. After passing through the round of existence in the Worlds of the Gods and the world of men, she was reborn in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa as Saṅghadāsī, the youngest of seven daughters of Kiki, king of Kāsi. She married and went to live with her husband’s family, and for a long period of time gave alms and performed other works of merit in company with her sisters.*";
P_HTM[1464]="***One day she fell at the feet of the Supreme Buddha Kassapa and made the following Earnest Wish, “May I at some time in the future stand in the relation of mother to a Buddha like you, and may I be the foremost of the women entitled to provide him with the Four Requisites.” Thereafter she passed through the round of existence in the Worlds of the Gods and the world of men, and in her present state of existence was reborn as the daughter of Treasurer Dhanañjaya, who was the son of Treasurer Ram. And in her present state of existence she has wrought many works of merit in my Religion. End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[1465]="***“Thus, monks, my daughter was not singing, but was breathing forth a Solemn Utterance as she saw the fulfillment of the prayer she had prayed.” And when he had thus spoken, the Teacher expounded the Law, saying, “Monks, even as out of a great heap of flowers of various kinds a skillful garland-maker makes all manner of garlands of flowers, even so the mind of Visākhā inclines to the doing of all manner of good deeds.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1466]="***53. Even as from a heap of flowers a man may make many garlands,*";
P_HTM[1467]="***Even so he that is born a mortal man should perform many good deeds.*";

P_HTM[1469]="***54. The perfume of flowers goes not against the wind...*";
P_HTM[1470]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi by way of reply to a question which the Elder Ānanda asked him.*";
P_HTM[1471]="***We are told that one evening, absorbed in meditation, the Elder pondered the following thought: “The Exalted One possesses the three perfumes of superlative excellence; namely, the perfume of sandal, the perfume of roots, and the perfume of flowers. Each of these perfumes, however, goes only with the wind. Is there possibly a substance whose perfume goes against the wind, or is there possibly a substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind?” Then the following thought occurred to him: “What is the use of my trying to determine this question all by myself? I will ask the Teacher, and the Teacher alone.” Accordingly he approached the Teacher and put the question to him. Therefore it is said:*";
P_HTM[1472]="***“Now one evening the Venerable Ānanda arose from profound meditation and drew near to the place where sat the Exalted One, and when he had drawn near, he addressed the Exalted One as follows, ‘Reverend Sir, there are these three substances whose perfume goes only with the wind and not against the wind. What are the three? The perfume of roots, the perfume of sandal, and the perfume of flowers. These, Reverend Sir, are the three substances whose perfume goes only with the wind and not against the wind. But, Reverend Sir, is there possibly a substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind, or is there possibly a substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind?’*";
P_HTM[1473]="***“Said the Exalted One in answer to the question, ‘Ānanda, there is a substance whose perfume goes with the wind, a substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind.’ ‘But, Reverend Sir, what is that substance whose perfume goes with the wind, that substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind?’ ‘Ānanda, if in any village or market-town in this world any human being, whether man or woman, seeks refuge in the Buddha, seeks refuge in the Law, seeks refuge in the Order; if he refrains from taking life, from taking that which is not given, from indulgence in the sins of the flesh and from lying, and avoids occasions of heedlessness through the use of liquor or spirits or other intoxicants; if he is virtuous; if he lives the life of a householder in righteousness, with a heart free from the stain of avarice; if he is liberal and generous, if he is open-handed, if he takes delight in giving, if he is attentive to petitions, if he takes delight in the distribution of alms, in all parts of the world monks and Brahmans utter his praise. If in such and such a village or market-town either a man or a woman seeks refuge in the Buddha, ... if he takes delight in the distribution of alms, deities and spirits utter his praise. If in such and such a village or market-town either a man or a woman seeks refuge in the Buddha, ... if he takes delight in the distribution of alms, such acts as these, Ānanda, are the substance whose perfume goes both with the wind and against the wind, whose perfume goes both with and against the wind.’ ” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1474]="***54. The perfume of flowers goes not against the wind,*";
P_HTM[1475]="***Nor that of sandal, nor that of Tagara or Mallikā flowers;*";

P_HTM[1485]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to alms given to Elder Kassapa the Great.*";
P_HTM[1486]="***For one day Elder Kassapa the Great arose from a Trance of Cessation which had lasted seven days and started out with the intention of making an unbroken round for alms in Rājagaha. At the same time five hundred pink-footed nymphs who were the wives of Sakka king of gods roused themselves and prepared five hundred portions of alms, intending to give those alms to the Elder. Taking their alms, they halted on the road and said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, accept these alms; do us a favor.” The Elder replied, “Begone, all of you. I intend to bestow my favor on the poor.” “Reverend Sir, do not destroy us; do us a favor.” But the Elder knew them and refused them again. When they still showed unwillingness to depart and renewed their request, he said, “You do not know your place. Begone!” So saying, he snapped his fingers at them.*";
P_HTM[1487]="***When the nymphs heard the Elder snap his fingers, they were unable to retain their composure, and not daring to remain where they were, took flight and returned once more to the World of the Gods. Said Sakka, “Where have you been?” “Sire, we went out, saying to ourselves, ‘We will give alms to this Elder who has just arisen from trance.’ ” “But did you succeed in giving your alms or not?” “He refused to accept our alms.” “What did he say?” “He said, ‘I intend to bestow my favor on the poor.’ ” “In what way did you go?” “In this way, Sire.” “Why should the likes of you seek to bestow alms on the Elder?” asked Sakka.*";
P_HTM[1488]="***Sakka himself desired to give alms to the Elder. So he disguised himself as an old weaver worn out by old age, an old man with broken teeth, gray hair, and a bent and broken body. And transforming Wellborn the celestial nymph into just such an old woman, and creating by supernatural power a weavers’ lane, he sat spinning out thread. The Elder went towards the city, thinking to himself, “I will bestow favor on poor folk.” And seeing this street outside of the city, he looked all about and noticed those two persons. At that moment Sakka was spinning out the thread and Wellborn was feeding a shuttle. The Elder thought to himself, “These two persons are doing manual labor in old age; there are doubtless no persons in this city poorer than these two. If they will give me but a ladleful, I will accept it and bestow my favor upon them.” Accordingly he went towards them.*";
P_HTM[1489]="***When Sakka saw them approaching, he said to Wellborn, “My lady, my noble Elder approaches hither. Pretend not to see him; be silent; sit down. In an instant we shall deceive him and give him alms.” The Elder approached and stood at the door of the house. But they pretended not to see him, continued their work as if nothing had happened, and bided their time. Then said Sakka, “Methinks an Elder stands at the door of the house. Just go find out.” Said Wellborn, “My lord, you go find out yourself.”*";
P_HTM[1490]="***Sakka went out of the house, saluted the Elder with the Five Rests, placed both hands on his knees, and wept. Then, straightening himself up, he said, “Which Elder are you?” Then, drawing back a little, he said, “My eyes are grown dim.” Then, placing his hand on his forehead, he looked up and said, “Alas! alas! it is a long, long time since our Elder Kassapa the Great has come to the door of my hut. Is there anything in the house?”*";
P_HTM[1491]="***Wellborn pretended to be somewhat embarrassed, but immediately answered, “Yes, husband, there is.” Sakka took the Elder’s bowl, saying, “Reverend Sir, consider not whether the food be coarse or fine, but be gracious to us.” The Elder gave the bowl, thinking,“It matters not whether they give me pot-herb or a fistful of rice-dust, I will accept it and bestow my favor upon them.” Sakka went into the house, took boiled rice from the rice-jar, filled the bowl, and placed it in the Elder’s hand.*";
P_HTM[1492]="***Straightway that portion of alms, richly flavored with all manner of sauces and curries, filled the whole city of Rājagaha with its fragrance. The Elder thought to himself, “This man is weak, but his alms are as powerful as the food of Sakka. Who can he be?” Perceiving that it was Sakka, he said, “You have done a grievous wrong in depriving poor folk of the opportunity to acquire merit. By bestowing alms on me to-day, any poor man soever might obtain the post of commander-in-chief or the post of treasurer.” “Is there any man poorer than I, Reverend Sir?” “How do you come to be poor, enjoying as you do splendor of dominion in the World of the Gods?”*";
P_HTM[1493]="***“Reverend Sir, this is the explanation. Before the Buddha appeared in the world I performed works of merit. When the Buddha appeared in the world, three deities of equal rank were reborn who, by the performance of works of merit, possessed greater glory than I, When these deities say in my presence, ‘Let us make holiday,’ and take female slaves and go down into the street, I take to my heels and enter my house. The glory from their persons overspreads my person, but the glory from my person does not overspread their persons. Who, Reverend Sir, is poorer than I?” “If this be true, henceforth do not attempt to deceive me by giving alms to me.” “Have I acquired merit, or have I not acquired merit, by giving alms to you through deception?” “You have acquired merit, brother.” “If this be true, Reverend Sir, it is my bounden duty to perform works of merit.” So saying, Sakka saluted the Elder, and accompanied by Wellborn, walked sunwise about the Elder. Then, flying up into the air, he breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance:*";
P_HTM[1494]="***Oh, almsgiving, the perfection of almsgiving.*";
P_HTM[1495]="***Well bestowed on Kassapa!*";
P_HTM[1496]="***Moreover, it is said in the Udāna:*";
P_HTM[1497]="***Once upon a time the Exalted One was in residence in the city of Rājagaha, at Veḷuvana monastery in Kalandakanivāpa. Now at this time Venerable Kassapa the Great was in residence at Pipphali Cave. For the space of seven days he sat in unbroken posture, absorbed in one of the forms of Ecstatic Meditation. Now on the expiration of those seven days Venerable Kassapa the Great arose from that trance, and straightway the thought occurred to him, “Suppose I were to go about Rājagaha for alms.” Now at that time five hundred celestial nymphs greatly desired that Venerable Kassapa the Great should receive alms from them. But Venerable Kassapa the Great refused those five hundred celestial nymphs. And early in the morning he put on his undergarment, and taking bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.*";
P_HTM[1498]="***Now at that time Sakka king of gods desired to give alms to Venerable Kassapa the Great. Therefore, taking the form of a weaver, he sat weaving thread, with Wellborn the Asura nymph filling a shuttle. Venerable Kassapa the Great approached the place where sat Sakka king of gods, and Sakka king of gods, seeing Venerable Kassapa the Great approaching, came forth from his place of abode, advanced to meet him, took his bowl, escorted him within the house, took boiled rice from the boiler, filled his bowl, and gave it to Venerable Kassapa the Great. The portion of rice was flavored with all manner of sauces and with all manner of curries, with an abundance of the choicest sauces and curries.*";
P_HTM[1499]="***Thereupon the following thought occurred to Venerable Kassapa the Great, “Who is this being the supernatural power of whose magic is so great?” Then the following thought occurred to Venerable Kassapa the Great, “This is Sakka king of gods.” When he perceived this, he spoke thus to Sakka king of gods, “How came you to do this, Kosiya? Do nothing of the sort again.” “Reverend Kassapa, we also have need of merit; we also must perform works of merit.” Then Sakka king of gods took leave of Venerable Kassapa the Great, walked sunwise about him, and flying up into the air, thrice breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance:*";
P_HTM[1500]="***Oh, almsgiving, the perfection of almsgiving.*";
P_HTM[1501]="***Well bestowed on Kassapa!*";
P_HTM[1502]="***The Exalted One, even as he stood in the monastery, heard the sound of his voice and straightway addressed the monks, “Monks, behold Sakka king of the gods. Having breathed forth a Solemn Utterance, he is flying through the air.” “What has he done, Reverend Sir?” “He has given alms to my son Kassapa through deception. Having so done, he is proceeding through the air breathing forth a Solemn Utterance.” “Reverend Sir, how did he know that he ought to give alms to the Elder?” “Monks, both gods and men love him who gives alms as did my son.” So saying, he himself also breathed forth the same Solemn Utterance. Moreover, the following passage occurs in the Sutta:*";
P_HTM[1503]="***With Divine Ear, purified, transcending that of man, the Exalted One heard Sakka king of gods, as he flew up into the air, thrice breathe forth the following Solemn Utterance in the sky:*";

P_HTM[1505]="***Well bestowed on Kassapa!*";

A second time and a third time, and unto six times, did he enter into a state of trance and fall away therefrom. As he entered into a state of trance for the seventh time, he thought to himself, “Six times I have fallen away from a state of trance. Doubtful is the future state of him who falls away from a state of trance. Now is the time for me to use the razor.”*";
P_HTM[1517]="***Accordingly he took the razor with which he shaved his hair, and lay down on his bed, intending to sever his windpipe. Māra perceived his intention and thought to himself, “This monk intends to use the razor. Those who use the razor are indifferent to life. Such men, having attained Insight, win Arahatship. But if I try to prevent him from carrying out his intention, he will pay no attention to my words. I will therefore induce the Teacher to prevent him.” So in the guise of an unknown he approached the Teacher and spoke thus,*";
P_HTM[1518]="***Mighty hero, mighty in wisdom, resplendent with mystic power and glory,*";
P_HTM[1519]="***Thou that hast overcome all hatred and fear, I bow myself before thy feet, all-seeing one.*";
P_HTM[1520]="***Mighty hero, thy disciple, though he has overcome death,*";
P_HTM[1521]="***Desires and meditates death. Dissuade him, thou giver of light.*";
P_HTM[1522]="***Exalted One, renowned among men, how shall thy disciple who delights in the Law*";
P_HTM[1523]="***Come to his end without accomplishing his desire, while yet untrained?*";
P_HTM[1524]="***At that moment the Elder drew his knife. The Teacher, perceiving that it was Māra, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1525]="***Thus do those that are steadfast, nor do they yearn for life.*";
P_HTM[1526]="***Godhika has uprooted Craving and has attained Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[1527]="***Now the Exalted One, accompanied by a large number of monks, entered the place where the Elder had lain down and used his knife. At that moment Māra, the Evil One, like a pillar of smoke or a mass of darkness, was searching in all directions for the Elder’s consciousness. Thought he, “Where has his rebirth-consciousness fixed itself?” The Exalted One pointed out to the monks the pillar of smoke and the mass of darkness and said to them, “Monks, that is Māra, the Evil One, searching for the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika. Thinks he, ‘Where has the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika fixed itself?’ But, monks, the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika has not fixed itself. For, monks, the goodly youth Godhika has passed into Nibbāna.” Māra, unable to find the place where the consciousness of the Elder had fixed itself, assumed the form of a prince, and taking in his hand a lute made of the light yellow wood of the vilva-tree, approached the Teacher and asked him,*";
P_HTM[1528]="***Above, below, across, to all the points and intermediate points*";
P_HTM[1529]="***Have I searched, but I cannot find him. Where has Godhika gone?*";
P_HTM[1530]="***Said the Teacher to Māra,*";
P_HTM[1531]="***This steadfast man, endowed with resolution, given to meditation, delighting ever in meditation.*";
P_HTM[1532]="***Exerting himself by day and by night, longing not to live.*";
P_HTM[1533]="***Has overcome the host of Māra and will return no more to be bom again.*";
P_HTM[1534]="***Godhika has uprooted Craving and has attained Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[1535]="***When the Teacher had thus spoken, Māra, the Evil One, addressed the Exalted One with a Stanza.*";
P_HTM[1536]="***Overwhelmed with disappointment, he dropped the girdle of his lute,*";
P_HTM[1537]="***And with heavy heart that demon straightway disappeared.*";
P_HTM[1538]="***Then said the Teacher, “Evil One, what have you to do with the place where the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika has fixed itself? A hundred or a thousand like you could never find it.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1539]="***57. If men are endowed with the virtues, live the life of Heedfulness,*";
P_HTM[1540]="***Are emancipated through perfect knowledge, Māra can never find the way to them.*";
P_HTM[1541]="*[44] 12. Garahadinnavatthu**12. Sirigutta And Garahadinna*";
P_HTM[1542]="***58. As upon a heap of rubbish cast out on the highway,*";
P_HTM[1543]="***The lotus will grow, sweetly fragrant, delighting the heart,*";
P_HTM[1544]="***59. Even so, among them that are as rubbish, blind folk, unconverted,*";
P_HTM[1545]="***The disciple of the Supremely Enlightened shines with exceeding glory because of wisdom.*";
P_HTM[1546]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Garahadinna.*";
P_HTM[1547]="***For at Sāvatthi once lived two friends, Sirigutta and Garahadinna. The former was a lay disciple of the Buddha, the latter an adherent of the Naked Ascetics, the Niganthas. The Naked Ascetics used to say repeatedly to Garahadinna, “Go to your friend Sirigutta and say, ‘Why do you visit the monk Gotama? What do you expect to get from him?’ Why not admonish him thus, that he may visit us and give us alms?” Garahadinna listened to what they said, went repeatedly to Sirigutta, and wherever he found him, standing or sitting, spoke thus to him, “Friend, of what use to you is the monk Gotama? What do you expect to get by visiting him? Should you not visit my own noble teachers instead and give alms to them?”*";
P_HTM[1548]="***Sirigutta listened to his friend’s talk and despite it kept silence for several days. One day, however, he lost his patience and said to Garahadinna, “Friend, you constantly come to me, and wherever you find me, standing or sitting, speak thus to me, ‘What do you expect to gain by visiting the monk Gotama? Visit my noble teachers instead and give alms to them.’ Now just answer me this question, ‘What do your noble teachers know?’ ” “Oh, sir, do not speak thus! There is nothing my noble teachers do not know. They know all about the past, the present, and the future. They know everybody’s thoughts, words, and actions. They know everything that can happen and everything that cannot happen.” “You don’t say so.” “Indeed I do.” “If this be true, you have committed a grievous fault in allowing me to remain ignorant of it all this time. Not until to-day did I learn of the supernatural power of knowledge possessed by your noble teachers. Go, sir, and invite your noble teachers in my name.”*";
P_HTM[1549]="***Garahadinna went to the Naked Ascetics, paid obeisance to them, and said, “My friend Sirigutta invites you for to-morrow.” “Did Sirigutta speak to you of himself?” “Yes, noble sirs.” They were pleased and delighted. Said they, “Our work is done. What gain will not accrue to us from the moment Sirigutta reposes faith in us?”*";
P_HTM[1550]="***Now Sirigutta’s place of residence was a large one, and in one place there was a long empty space between two houses. Here, therefore, he caused a long ditch to be dug, and this ditch he caused to be filled with dung and slime. Beyond the ditch, at both ends, he caused posts to be driven into the ground, and to these posts he caused ropes to be attached. He caused the seats to be so placed, with the front legs resting on the ground and the back legs resting on the ropes, that the instant the heretics sat down they would be tipped over backwards and flung head first into the ditch. In order that no sign of a ditch might be visible, he had coverlets spread over the seats. He caused several large earthenware vessels to be washed clean, and their mouths to be covered with plaintain-leaves and pieces of cloth. And these vessels, empty though they were, he caused to be placed behind the house, smeared on the outside with rice-porridge, lumps of boiled rice, ghee, jaggery, and cake-crumbs.*";
P_HTM[1551]="***Early in the morning Garahadinna went quickly to the house of Sirigutta and asked him, “Has food been prepared for my noble teachers?” “Yes, friend, food has been prepared.” “But where is it?” “In all these earthenware vessels is rice-porridge, in all these is boiled rice, in all these are ghee, jaggery, cakes, and other kinds of food. Likewise have seats been prepared.” “Very well,” said Garahadinna, and went his way.*";
P_HTM[1552]="***As soon as Garahadinna had departed, five hundred Naked Ascetics arrived. Sirigutta came forth from the house, paid obeisance to the Naked Ascetics with the Five Rests, and taking his stand before them and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, thought to himself, “So you know all about the past, the present, and the future! So at least your supporter tells me. If you really do know all this, do not enter my house. For even if you enter my house, there is no rice-porridge prepared for you, nor boiled rice, nor any other kind of food. If you do not know all this and still enter my house, I will cause you to be flung into a ditch filled with dung, and will then cause you to be beaten with sticks.” Having thus reflected, he gave the following order to his men, “When you observe that they are about to sit down, take your places in the rear and pull the coverlets which are spread over the seats out from under, lest the coverlets be smeared with filth.”*";
P_HTM[1553]="***Then said Sirigutta to the Naked Ascetics, “Come hither, Reverend Sirs.” The Naked Ascetics entered. They were about to sit down on the seats which had been prepared, when Sirigutta’s men called out to them, “Wait, Reverend Sirs. Do not sit down yet.” “For what reason?” “When your reverences enter our house, you must observe a certain etiquette in taking your seats.” “What must we do, brother?” “Each one of you must take his stand at the foot of the seat which has been prepared for him, and then you must all sit down at once.” We are told that Sirigutta had this done in order that no one of the Naked Ascetics should fall into the ditch by himself, and thus be able to warn the rest of his brethren not to sit down on the seats.*";
P_HTM[1554]="***“Very well,” said the Naked Ascetics. For they thought, “We ought to do whatever these men tell us to do.” So all of them took their places in order, each at the foot of the seat which had been prepared for him. Then Sirigutta’s men said to them, “Reverend Sirs, sit down quickly, all at once.” When Sirigutta’s men observed that they were about to sit down, they pulled the coverlets which were spread over the seats out from under. The Naked Ascetics sat down all at once. Thereupon the legs of the seats which rested on the ropes gave way, and the Naked Ascetics were immediately tipped over backwards and flung head first into the ditch. When the Naked Ascetics fell into the ditch, Sirigutta closed the door. As fast as they crawled out of the slime, he caused them to be beaten with sticks, calling out to them, “So you know all about the past, the present, and the future!” Finally he said, “This will suffice to teach them a lesson,” and caused the door to be opened. They escaped through the door and began to run away. But Sirigutta had previously made slippery the ground along the road they would have to take, by covering it with whitewash. The result was that they lost their foothold and fell again and again. Here again he caused them to be beaten with sticks. Finally he said, “This will suffice for you,” and let them go. “You have ruined us!” they wailed; “you have ruined us!” So saying, they went to the door of their supporter’s house.*";
P_HTM[1555]="***When Garahadinna saw the sorry plight of the Naked Ascetics, he became very angry and said, “Sirigutta has ruined me. Even as they stretched out their hands and paid obeisance to him, he has beaten with sticks and brought humiliation upon my noble teachers, my Field of Merit, who are able to bestow the Six Worlds of the Gods at their own good pleasure.” Forthwith he went to the royal palace and caused a fine of a thousand pieces of money to be inflicted upon Sirigutta. The king sent Sirigutta a summons. Sirigutta immediately went to the king, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Your majesty, will you wait until you have first investigated the matter, before inflicting punishment, or is it your intention to inflict punishment without an investigation?” “I intend to investigate the matter before I inflict punishment.” “Very well, your majesty. First investigate the matter, and then do as you think proper.”*";
P_HTM[1556]="***Sirigutta then told the king the whole story from the beginning, saying, “Your majesty, my friend is an adherent of the Naked Ascetics. He used to come to me repeatedly, and wherever he found me, standing or sitting, used to say to me, ‘Friend, of what use to you is the monk Gotama? What do you expect to gain by visiting him?’ ” Sirigutta told the whole story, and having so done, said to the king, “Your majesty, if you think it right to inflict punishment in this case, do so.” Looking at Garahadinna, the king said, “Is what you have just told me the truth?” “It is the truth, your majesty.” Then said the king to Garahadinna, “Why did you take to yourself teachers who knew so little, and go about and say of your teachers to the disciple of the Tathāgata, ‘They know everything’? You have brought punishment on your own head, and on your own head only shall it descend.” So saying, the king ordered punishment to be inflicted upon Garahadinna. Likewise he caused the Naked Ascetics who resorted to his house to be beaten with sticks and expelled.*";
P_HTM[1557]="***Garahadinna was very angry about this and for a fortnight afterwards refused to speak to Sirigutta. Finally he thought to himself, “It isn’t worth while for me to go about acting thus. What I should do is to bring humiliation upon the monks who resort to Sirigutta’s house.” Accordingly he went to Sirigutta and said to him, “Friend Sirigutta!” “What is it, friend?” “There is quarrel, there is strife, between those that are called kinsmen and friends. You do not speak. Why do you act in this way?” “Friend, I do not speak to you because you do not speak to me. But, friend, whatever is done is done, and I will not on that account break off our friendship.” From that time on both stood in one place and sat in one place.*";
P_HTM[1558]="***Now one day Sirigutta said to Garahadinna, “Of what use to you are the Naked Ascetics? What do you expect to gain by visiting them? Should you not approach my Teacher instead and give alms to my own noble monks?” That was the very thing Garahadinna longed to do. It was as though Sirigutta had scratched him on a spot that itched. Garahadinna asked Sirigutta, “What does your Teacher know?” “Oh, sir, do not speak thus! There is nothing beyond the range of my Teacher’s knowledge. He knows all about the past, the present, and the future. In sixteen different ways he comprehends the thoughts of all living beings.” “If this be true, I know not why you have not told me about it all this time. Very well. Go to your Teacher and invite him for to-morrow. I should like to entertain him. Beg him, with his five hundred monks, to accept my hospitality.”*";
P_HTM[1559]="***Sirigutta approached the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Reverend Sir, my friend Garahadinna asks me to invite you to his house. He asks me to beg you, with your five hundred monks, to accept his hospitality for to-morrow. Several days ago, however, I did such and such to the Naked Ascetics who resort to his house. I am not sure that he intends to seek revenge for what I did. But I am by no means certain that it is with a pure motive that he desires to give you alms. Consider the matter well. If you think proper, accept; if not, decline.” The Teacher considered within himself, “What does he intend to do to us?” Immediately he became aware of the following, “He will cause a great pit to be dug between two houses and will cause eighty cartloads of acacia-wood to be brought and dumped into the pit, completely filling it. Then he will set the wood on fire and seek to humiliate us by causing us to be thrown into this charcoal-pit.”*";
P_HTM[1560]="***Again considering within himself, “Have I sufficient reason for going there or have I not?” the Teacher saw the following, “I will extend my foot and place it upon the charcoal-pit. Thereupon the matting, so placed as to cover the pit, will disappear, and a gigantic lotus as big as a wheel will spring up, rending the charcoal-pit asunder. Then I will set foot upon the pericarp of the lotus and will sit down in a seat, and my five hundred monks will likewise mount the lotus and sit down. A great multitude will assemble, and in this assemblage I will pronounce a discourse of thanksgiving consisting of two Stanzas. At the conclusion of the Stanzas eighty thousand living beings will obtain Comprehension of the Law, Sirigutta and Garahadinna will attain the Fruit of Conversion and will spend their great wealth in my Religion. For the sake of this goodly youth it is my duty to go there.” Accordingly the Teacher accepted the invitation.*";
P_HTM[1561]="***Sirigutta went and informed Garahadinna that the Teacher had accepted his invitation. Said he, “Prepare hospitality for the Prince of the World.” Garahadinna thought to himself, “Now I shall know what ought to be done to him.” So he caused a great pit to be dug between two houses and caused eighty cartloads of acacia-wood to be brought and dumped into the pit, completely filling it. Then he set the wood on fire, and putting bellows in position, caused them to be blown all night long, until the pile of acacia-wood was a mass of blazing charcoal. Across the top of the pit he caused unhewn logs to be laid and caused them to be covered with matting and smeared with cow-dung. On one side he caused a gangway to be built of the flimsiest kind of sticks. Thought he, “The moment they set foot on this framework the sticks will break, and they will topple over and fall into the charcoal-pit.” Behind the house he caused earthenware vessels to be placed, precisely as Sirigutta had done, and there also caused seats to be prepared.*";
P_HTM[1562]="***Early in the morning Sirigutta went to Garahadinna’s house and said to him, “Friend, have you provided food?” “Yes, friend, I have.” “But where is it?” “Come and see,” said Garahadinna. And he took him and showed him the earthenware vessels, precisely as Sirigutta had done. “Very well, sir,” said Sirigutta. A great multitude assembled. When heretics invite the Buddha, a great multitude always assembles. The heretics assemble, saying to themselves, “We shall witness the discomfiture of the monk Gotama.” The orthodox assemble, saying to themselves, “To-day the Teacher will preach the Law with might, and we shall see for ourselves the power of a Buddha and the grace of a Buddha.”*";
P_HTM[1563]="***On the following day the Teacher, accompanied by five hundred monks, went to the house of Garahadinna and stood before the door. Garahadinna came forth from the house, paid obeisance to the monks with the Five Rests, and taking his stand before them and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, thought to himself, “So, Reverend Sir, you know all about the past, the present, and the future! In sixteen different ways you comprehend the thoughts of all living beings! So at least your supporter tells me. If you really do know all this, do not enter my house. For even if you enter my house, you will find no rice-porridge or boiled rice or any other kind of food. Instead I will cause you to be flung into a charcoal-pit and will bring humiliation upon you.”*";
P_HTM[1564]="***Having thus reflected, he took the Teacher’s bowl and said to him, “Come hither, Exalted One.” Then he said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, when you come to our house, you must observe a certain etiquette in coming.” “What must we do, brother?” “You must enter the house all by yourself, preceding the rest. After you have sat down, the rest may come in.” This, we are told, was the thought that occurred to him, “If the rest see him go in first and fall into the charcoal-pit, they will not venture near it. I will cause him alone to fall therein, and thereby confound him.” “Very well,” said the Teacher, and advanced to the pit all by himself. Garahadinna went as far as the charcoal-pit, then stepped back, and standing at a distance, said, “Go forward, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[1565]="***The Teacher extended his foot and placed it over the charcoal-pit. Thereupon the matting disappeared, and lotus flowers as big as wheels sprang up, rending the charcoal-pit asunder. The Teacher set foot on the pericarp of the lotus, and going forward, sat down on the Seat of the Buddha, miraculously prepared. The monks likewise went thereon and sat down. Fire, as it were, arose in the belly of Garahadinna. He approached the Teacher and said to him, “Reverend Sir, be unto me a refuge.” “What does this mean?” “There is no rice-porridge or boiled rice or any other kind of food in the house for the five hundred monks. What am I to do?” “But what have you done?” “Between two houses I caused a great pit to be dug, and this pit I caused to be filled with charcoal, thinking to myself, ‘I will cause the Teacher to fall therein and thus confound him.’ But instead of this, great lotus flowers have sprung up, rending the charcoal-pit asunder. And all the monks have set foot on the pericarp of the lotus and have gone forward and sat down on seats miraculously prepared. What am I to do?”*";
P_HTM[1566]="***“Did you not just now point out to me certain earthenware vessels and say, ‘All these vessels are filled with rice-porridge; all these are filled with boiled rice,’ and so forth?” “What I said was false, master. The vessels are empty.” “Never mind. Go look at the rice-porridge and other kinds of food in those vessels.” At that instant the vessels over which he spoke the word “rice-porridge” were filled with rice-porridge, the vessels over which he spoke the words “boiled rice” were filled with boiled rice, and so it happened likewise with the other vessels.*";
P_HTM[1567]="***When Garahadinna beheld this miracle, his body was suffused with joy and happiness and his heart believed. With profound reverence he waited on the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha. The meal over, Garahadinna, indicating that he wished the Buddha to pronounce the words of thanksgiving, took his bowl. Said the Teacher in pronouncing the words of thanksgiving, “These beings, because they are without the Eye of Knowledge, know neither my merits, nor the merits of my disciples, nor the merits of the Religion of the Buddha. Inasmuch as they are without the Eye of Knowledge, they are blind. Only the wise have eyes.”*";
P_HTM[1568]="***So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1569]="***58. As upon a heap of rubbish cast out on the highway,*";
P_HTM[1570]="***The lotus will grow, sweetly fragrant, delighting the heart,*";
P_HTM[1571]="***59. Even so, among them that are as rubbish, blind folk, unconverted,*";
P_HTM[1572]="***The disciple of the Supremely Enlightened shines with exceeding glory because of wisdom.*";
P_HTM[1573]="***At the conclusion of the religious instruction eighty thousand living beings obtained Comprehension of the Law. Both Garahadinna and Sirigutta attained the Fruit of Conversion and thereafter dispensed all of their wealth in alms in the Religion of the Buddha.*";
P_HTM[1574]="***The Teacher rose from his seat and went to the monastery. In the evening the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth, “Oh, how wonderful are the virtues of the Buddhas! To think that lotus flowers should spring up and rend asunder a blazing mass of acacia-coals!” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, it is not at all wonderful that just now, when I, who am now a Buddha, was present, lotus flowers sprang up from a bed of coals. When my knowledge was not yet ripe and I was merely a Future Buddha, they sprang up also.” “At what time was that, Reverend Sir? Pray tell us the story.” In response to their requests, the Teacher related a Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[1575]="***I would gladly fall into Hell, heels up, head down.*";
P_HTM[1576]="***I will do naught that is not honorable. Here, take alms!*";
P_HTM[1577]="***And the Teacher related in detail the Khadiraṅgāra Jātaka.*";
P_HTM[1578]="*5. Bālavaggo**The Simpleton*";
P_HTM[1579]="*[45] 1. Aññatarapurisavatthu**1. The King and the Poor Man with a Beautiful Wife*";
P_HTM[1580]="***60. Long is the night to him that watcheth; long is a league to him that is weary;*";
P_HTM[1581]="***Long is the revolution of being for simpletons that know not the Good Law.*";
P_HTM[1582]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Pasenadi Kosala and a certain other man.*";
P_HTM[1583]="***The story goes that on the day of a certain festival King Pasenadi Kosala mounted his magnificently adorned pure white elephant Puṇḍārika and with great pomp and kingly majesty marched sunwise round the city. When the dismissal took place, the populace, pelted with clods of earth and beaten with sticks, ran hither and thither, craning their necks to see what was going on. Royal pomp, we are told, is the reward kings receive for generous almsgiving, keeping the moral precepts, and performing works of merit.*";
P_HTM[1584]="***On the topmost floor of a seven-storied palace the wife of a certain poor man opened a window, looked at the king, and then withdrew. To the king it was as if the full moon had entered a bank of clouds; in fact, so infatuated with her was he that he nearly fell off the back of the elephant. Quickly completing the sunwise circuit of the city, he entered the royal precincts and said to a trusted minister, “Did you see, in such and such a place, a palace which I looked at?” “I did, your majesty.” “Did you see a certain woman there?” “I did, your majesty.” “Go and find out whether she is married or not.” He went, and learning that she was married, returned and said to the king, “She is a married woman.” Thereupon the king said to him, “Well then, summon her husband.” So the minister went and said to the husband, “Come, sir, the king summons you.” The husband thought to himself, “I have reason to fear for my life on account of my wife.” Not daring, however, to disobey the king’s command, he went to the palace, paid obeisance to the king, and stood waiting. The king said to him, “Hereafter you are to be my servant.” “Your majesty, I should prefer to earn a living by doing my own work. Let me pay you tribute.” “I don’t wish your tribute. From this day forth you are to be my servant.” So the king gave him a shield and a sword.*";
P_HTM[1585]="***This, they say, was the thought in the king’s mind, “I will fix guilt upon him, kill him, and take his wife.” The husband, in fear and trembling of death, served the king most faithfully. As the fire of his passion increased, the king, finding no flaw in him, thought to himself, “I will charge him with some fault and punish him with death.” So he summoned him and said to him, “Fellow, go a league hence to the bank of the river, and in such and such a place you will find red earth and water-lilies both white and blue. These you must bring back to me in the evening when I go to bathe. Should you fail to return at that moment, I will punish you.” (A servant is regarded as of less account than the four kinds of slaves. For slaves bought with money and other kinds of slaves have only to say, “My head aches,” or “My back aches,” to obtain relief from their duties. This is not the case, however, with servants. Servants must do whatever they are told to do.) The husband thought to himself, “The king’s order must be obeyed. I shall have to go, and no mistake. But red earth and water-lilies both white and blue are found only in the country of the dragons. Where can such as I get them?”*";
P_HTM[1586]="***Terrified with the fear of death, he went home and said to his wife, “Wife, is my rice cooked?” “It is on the brazier, master.” Unable to wait until the rice was cooked, he bade her take some of the gruel out with a ladle, stuffed the rice, all dripping as it was, into a basket, hastily adding some curry, and hurried away on his league’s journey. Even as he hurried along, the rice was cooked.*";
P_HTM[1587]="***He put aside a choice portion of rice and began to eat. As he was eating he saw a traveler and said to him, “Master, I have put aside a choice portion of rice. Take it and eat it.” The traveler took the rice and ate it. When the king’s servant had finished his meal, he cast a handful of rice into the water, and having rinsed his mouth, cried out with a loud voice, “May the winged dragons, the guardian divinities of this pool, hear my prayer! The king, desiring to visit punishment upon me, has laid upon me this command, ‘Bring me red earth and water-lilies both white and blue.’ By giving rice to a traveler I have gained a thousand rewards, and by giving rice to the fish in this water I have gained a hundred rewards. I make over to you all the merit I have acquired by these actions. Bring me red earth and water-lilies both white and blue.” Three times did he utter these words with a loud voice.*";
P_HTM[1588]="***Now the king of the dragons lived there; and when he heard those words, he disguised himself as an old man, and going to the king’s servant, said to him, “What is it that you say?” The king’s servant repeated his words. “Make over the merit to me,” said the dragon. “I do make it over to you, master,” said the man. Again the dragon said, “Make over the merit to me.” “I do make it over to you, master,” replied the man. When the king’s servant had repeated his words the third time, the dragon brought red earth and water-lillies both white and blue and gave them to the king’s servant.*";
P_HTM[1589]="***The king thought to himself, “Many are the devices of men. If by any means he should obtain what I sent him for, my purpose might not succeed.” So he had the door closed very early and the seal brought to him. The king’s servant returned at the king’s bathing-time, but found the door closed. Summoning the porter, he ordered him to open the door. Said the porter, “It cannot be opened. The king had the seal brought to the royal apartments very early.” “I am the king’s messenger. Open the door,” said the king’s servant. But the door remained closed, and the king’s servant thought to himself, “There is no hope for me now. What shall I do?”*";
P_HTM[1590]="***He flung the lump of red earth on the threshold, hung the flowers over the door, and cried with a loud voice, “All ye that dwell in the city, be witnesses that I have executed the king’s order. The king is seeking without just cause to kill me.” Thrice he cried these words with a loud voice and then, thinking to himself, “Where shall I go now?” he concluded, “The monks are soft-hearted. I will go and sleep at the monastery.” (In times of prosperity people here in the world scarcely know even that monks exist, but when they are whelmed with adversity, they desire to go to a monastery. Therefore was it that the king’s servant, reflecting “I have no other refuge,” went to the monastery and lay down in a pleasant place to sleep.)*";
P_HTM[1591]="***As for the king, he was unable to sleep that night, but was consumed with the fire of passion as he thought about that woman. Said he to himself, “When day breaks, I will kill that man and fetch the woman here to my palace.” At that moment he heard four sounds.*";
P_HTM[1592]="***At that moment four men reborn in the Hell of the Iron Caldron, sixty leagues in measure, who, after boiling and bubbling like grains of rice in a red-hot kettle for thirty thousand years, had reached the bottom, and after thirty thousand more years had come again to the rim, lifted up their heads, looked at each other, tried to pronounce a Stanza apiece, but, unable to do so, gave utterance each to a single syllable, turned over, and flopped back again into the Iron Caldron.*";
P_HTM[1593]="***The king, unable to sleep, immediately after the middle watch heard these sounds. Frightened and terrified in mind, he pondered within himself, “Is my life to come to an end, or that of my chief consort, or is my kingdom to fall?” All the rest of the night he was unable to close his eyes; and when morning came, he sent for his house-priest and said to him, “Master, immediately after the middle watch I heard loud and terrible sounds. Whether they portend the end of my kingdom or of my queen or of myself I know not; therefore I sent for you.”*";
P_HTM[1594]="***“Your majesty, what sounds did you hear?” “Master, I heard the sounds ‘Du, Sa, Na, So.’ Consider what they portend.” As for the Brahman, he was absolutely in the dark as to what the sounds meant. But fearing that, if he admitted his ignorance, he would lose both gain and honor, he answered, “It is a grave matter, your majesty.” “Master, be more specific.” “It means that you are to die.” The king’s fear doubled. “Master, is there no way to avert this?” “Yes, your majesty, there is. Have no fear. I know the three Vedas.” “But what must be done?” “By offering the sacrifice of every kind of living creature you can save your life, your majesty.” “What must we procure?” “A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, a hundred bulls, a hundred cows, a hundred goats, a hundred asses, a hundred thoroughbreds, a hundred rams, a hundred fowls, a hundred pigs, a hundred boys, and a hundred girls.” Thus did the Brahman direct the king to procure a hundred of every kind of living creature. For, said he to himself, “If I direct the king to procure wild animals only, people will say, ‘He does that because he wants to eat them himself.’ ” Therefore was it that he included also elephants, horses, and human beings.*";
P_HTM[1595]="***The king, thinking to himself, “I must save my life at any cost,” said to the Brahman, “Procure quickly every kind of living creature.” The king’s men received their orders and procured more than the required number. Moreover, it is said in the Kosala Saṁyutta, “Now at that time a great sacrifice was prepared for King Pasenadi Kosala: five hundred bulls, five hundred steers, five hundred cows, five hundred goats, five hundred rams were led to the stake for the sacrifice. They that were his slaves or bond-servants or laborers, fearing punishment, fearing calamity, made preparations for the sacrifice, weeping and wailing. The populace, making lament for their kinsfolk, made a loud noise, a noise like that of the earth splitting open.”*";
P_HTM[1596]="***Queen Mallikā, hearing that noise, went to the king and said, “Your majesty, how is it that your senses are disordered and weary?” “How now, Mallikā. Know you not that a poisonous serpent has penetrated my ears?” “Why, what do you mean, your majesty?” “At night I heard such and such a sound, and when I asked the house-priest about it, he said to me, ‘It means that you are to die, but you can save your life by offering a sacrifice of every kind of living creature.’ Now I must save my life at any cost. Therefore was it that I ordered these living creatures to be procured.”*";
P_HTM[1597]="***Said Queen Mallikā, “You are a simpleton, your majesty. You may have an abundant supply of food, you may feast upon viands flavored with all manner of sauces and curries cooked by the bucketful, you may rule over two kingdoms, but all the same you have very little sense.” “Why do you say that?” “Where did you ever hear of one man’s saving his life by the death of another? Just because a stupid Brahman told you to, is that any reason why you should overwhelm the populace with suffering? In a neighboring monastery resides the Teacher, the foremost personality in the world of men and gods, possessed of limitless knowledge as regards the past, the present, and the future. Ask him and do as he advises you.”*";
P_HTM[1598]="***So the king went to the monastery in light conveyances with Mallikā, but was so terrified with the fear of death that he was unable to speak a word. He paid obeisance to the Teacher and stood respectfully at one side. The Teacher was the first to speak, saying to him, “Your majesty, how is it that you come here so late in the day?” The king gave no answer. Then said Mallikā to the Tathāgata, “Reverend Sir, immediately after the last watch he heard a sound, and he told the house-priest about it, and the house-priest said to him, ‘It means that you are to die, but you can avert such a calamity by taking every kind of living creature and offering a sacrifice of their blood; in this way you can save your life.’ So the king ordered the living creatures to be procured. That is why I brought him to you here.” “Is this true, your majesty?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “What sound did you hear?” The king repeated the sound to him just as he had heard it. The moment the Tathāgata heard it, he was silent for a moment, and then said to him, “Your majesty, have no fear. This does not mean that you are to die. The sounds you heard were uttered by evildoers in torment to express their sufferings.” “Why, what did they do, Reverend Sir?” The Exalted One, requested to tell the story of their misdeeds, said, “Well then, your majesty, listen.” So saying, he related the following*";
P_HTM[1599]="***1 a. Story of the Past: The Hell Pot*";
P_HTM[1600]="***In times gone by, when men lived twenty thousand years, appeared the Exalted Kassapa. As he journeyed from place to place with twenty thousand monks freed from the Depravities, he arrived at Benāres. The residents of Benāres united by twos and threes and in larger groups and provided food for the visitors. At that time there were living at Benāres four sons of wealthy merchants. Each of them possessed four hundred millions of treasure, and they were boon companions. One day they took counsel together, saying, “We have much wealth in our houses. What shall we do with it? With a Buddha so great and so good journeying from place to place, shall we give alms, shall we perform works of merit, shall we keep the moral precepts?”*";
P_HTM[1601]="***Not one of the four assented to this proposal. One said, “Let us spend our time drinking strong drink and eating savory meat. This would be a profitable way for us to spend our lives.” Another said, “Let us spend our time eating fragrant rice three years old, with all manner of choice flavors.” Another said, “Let us have all manner of hard food cooked and spend our time eating it.” Another said, “Friends, there is only one thing for us to do, and it is this: The woman does not live who will refuse to do your will if you offer her money. Let us offer money to other men’s wives and commit adultery with them.” “Good, good!” cried all of them, agreeing to his proposal.*";
P_HTM[1602]="***From that time on they sent money to beautiful women, one after another, and for twenty thousand years committed adultery. When they died, they were reborn in the Avīci Hell, where they suffered torment during the interval between two Buddhas. Dying again, because the fruit of their evil deeds was not yet exhausted, they were reborn in the Hell of the Iron Caldron, sixty leagues in measure. After sinking for thirty thousand years, they reached the bottom, and after rising for thirty thousand years, they came again to the brim. Each one of them desired to pronounce a single Stanza, but all they could do was to utter a single syllable apiece. Then they flopped over and sank back again into the Iron Caldron.*";
P_HTM[1603]="***“Your majesty, what was the first sound you heard?” “‘Du,’ Reverend Sir.” The Teacher, completing the Stanza left uncompleted by the evildoer, recited it in full as follows,*";
P_HTM[1604]="***Du. An evil life we led, we who gave not what we had.*";
P_HTM[1605]="***With all the wealth we had, we made no refuge for ourselves.*";
P_HTM[1606]="***Having made known the meaning of this Stanza to the king, the Teacher asked him what the other sounds were that he heard. When the king told him, he completed the remainder as follows,*";
P_HTM[1607]="***Sa. Sixty thousand years in all have we completed;*";
P_HTM[1608]="***We are boiling in Hell. When will the end come?*";
P_HTM[1609]="***Na. There is no end. Whence comes an end? No end appears;*";
P_HTM[1610]="***For then both you and I, sir, committed sin.*";
P_HTM[1611]="***So. Be sure that when I go hence and am reborn as a human being,*";
P_HTM[1612]="***I shall be bountiful, keep the moral precepts, and do much good.*";
P_HTM[1613]="***When the Teacher had pronounced these Stanzas, one after another, and declared their meaning, he said, “Your majesty, those four men desired, each of them, to pronounce a single Stanza, but all they could do was to utter a single syllable apiece. Then they flopped over and sank back again into the Iron Caldron.” (Those evildoers, we are told, have been sinking in the Hell Pot ever since King Pasenadi Kosala heard those sounds, but not even yet have a thousand years elapsed.)*";
P_HTM[1614]="***The king was profoundly moved by the discourse of the Teacher. Thought he to himself, “A grievous sin indeed is this sin of adultery. Those four adulterers were tormented in Hell during the interval between two Buddhas. Passing from that existence, they were reborn in the Hell of the Iron Caldron, sixty leagues in measure, and there endured torment for sixty thousand years. Even so the time of their release from suffering has not yet come. I also conceived a sinful passion for the wife of another and got no sleep all night long. From this time forth I shall no more set my heart on another man’s wife.” And he said to the Tathāgata,*";
P_HTM[1615]="***“Reverend Sir, to-day I know how long the night is.” Now the king’s servant was also seated there; and when he heard this remark, his faith was confirmed, and he said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, to-day the king has come to know how long the night is. Yesterday I myself came to know how long a league is.” The Teacher joined the words of both men and said, “For one man the night is long; for another a league is long; for a fool the revolution of being is long.” So saying, he taught the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1616]="***60. Long is the night to him that watcheth; long is a league to him that is weary;*";
P_HTM[1617]="***Long is the revolution of being for simpletons that know not the Good Law.*";
P_HTM[1618]="***The king paid obeisance to the Teacher, and then went and released those living beings from their bonds. Thereupon both men and women, released from their bonds, bathed their heads and went to their own homes, extolling the virtues of Mallikā and saying, “Long live our gracious Queen Mallikā, through whom our lives were spared!”*";
P_HTM[1619]="***In the evening the monks assembled in the Hall of Truth and began to discuss the incidents of the day. “How wise,” said they, “is this Mallikā! By her own wisdom has she saved the lives of all these people.” The Teacher, seated in his Perfumed Chamber, hearing the talk of the monks, came forth from the Perfumed Chamber, entered the Hall of Truth, sat down on the Seat of Wisdom, and asked them, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here now talking about?” They told him. “Monks, this is not the first time Mallikā has saved the lives of a large number of people by her own wisdom. She did so in a former existence also.” And he made his meaning clear by relating the following*";
P_HTM[1620]="***1 b. Story of the Past: The King of Benāres and Queen Dinnā*";
P_HTM[1621]="***In times long gone by a king’s son approached a certain banyan-tree and prayed thus to the spirit that dwelt therein, “Good spirit, in this Land of the Rose-Apple are a hundred kings and a hundred queens. If, on the death of my father, I obtain the kingdom, I will make an offering to you with the blood of these kings and queens.” When his father died and he came into his kingdom, he reflected, “It is through the supernatural power of the tree-spirit that I have received my kingdom. I must now make my offering to him.” So he set out with a large force, overpowered one king, and with the aid of the conquered king another and another, until finally he had all the kings in his power. Then, taking the hundred kings and the hundred queens with him, he proceeded to the tree.*";
P_HTM[1622]="***As he marched along, he said to himself, “Dinnā, the chief-consort of the youngest king, is great with child. I will therefore let her go. But the rest I will kill by giving them poison to drink.” As he was clearing the ground under the tree, the tree-spirit thought, “This king is taking all these kings and is preparing to make an offering to me with their blood because of his conviction that he captured them with my assistance. But if he slays them, the royal stock of the Land of the Rose-Apple will be rooted out, and the foot of the tree will be polluted.”*";
P_HTM[1623]="***The tree-spirit asked himself whether he could stop him. Realizing that he could not, he went to another spirit, told him what was the matter, and asked him whether he could. Receiving a negative answer, he went to yet another, but with the same result. Then he went to all the Cakkavāḷa deities, but they could do nothing for him. Finally he went to the Four Great Kings, who said to him, “We can do nothing, but our King is superior to us in deeds of merit and in wisdom; ask him.” So he went to Sakka and told him what was the matter. “Sakka,” said he, “if you remain in an attitude of ease and indifference, and the stock of princes is rooted out, you will be responsible for it.”*";
P_HTM[1624]="***Sakka said, “I cannot stop him, but I will tell you how he can be stopped. Put on your night-gown, go forth from your tree in plain sight of the king, and act as though you were going away. The king will say to himself, ‘The tree-spirit is going away; I must stop him,’ and will use every effort to persuade you to remain. Then you say to him, ‘You made the following promise to me, “I will bring a hundred kings and a hundred queens and make an offering to you with their blood;” but you have come here without the consort of King Uggasena. I will not accept an offering from such a liar.’ As soon as the king hears you say that, he will bring King Uggasena’s consort, Queen Dinnā. She will instruct the king in the Law and will save the lives of this numerous company.” Such was the ruse Sakka suggested to the tree-spirit.*";
P_HTM[1625]="***The tree-spirit did as Sakka suggested, and the king promptly brought Queen Dinnā. She approached her own consort. King Uggasena, although he was seated in the outer circle of the hundred kings, and paid obeisance only to him. The king of Benāres was offended at her and said to himself, “Although I, the oldest king of all, am present, she pays obeisance to the youngest of all.” Then she said to the king of Benāres, “Do I owe you allegiance? This my lord is for me the giver of dominion. Why should I pass him by and pay obeisance to you?”*";
P_HTM[1626]="***The tree-spirit honored her with a handful of flowers in plain sight of the assembled throng, crying out, “Well said, your majesty! Well said, your majesty!”*";
P_HTM[1627]="***Again the king of Benāres said to her, “If you pay not obeisance to me, why do you not pay obeisance to this tree-spirit, who has great magical power and has bestowed dominion and majesty on me?” “Your majesty, it was by your own merit that you overpowered these kings; the tree-spirit did not overpower them and give them into your hands at all.” Again the tree-spirit honored her in the same way, saying, “Well said, your majesty!” Again she said to the king, “You say, ‘The tree-spirit overpowered all these kings and gave them into my hands.’ Just now a tree to the left of your spirit was burned with fire. If your spirit possesses such great magical power, why could he not put out that fire?” Again the tree-spirit honored her in the same way, saying, “Well said, your majesty!”*";
P_HTM[1628]="***As the queen spoke, she wept and laughed. The king said, “You have gone mad.” “Your majesty, why do you speak thus? Such as I are not mad.” “Then why do you weep and laugh?” “Your majesty, listen to me:*";
P_HTM[1629]="***1 c. Story of the Past: The woman who killed a ewe*";
P_HTM[1630]="***“In times long gone by I was reborn as the daughter of a good family. While living in my husband’s house, an intimate friend of my husband visited the house as a guest. When I saw him, I desired to cook him a meal. So I gave my servant a penny and said to her, ‘Get me some meat.’ She was unable to get any, and when she returned she told me so. Now there was a ewe lying in the rear of the house; so I cut off her head and prepared a meal. Because I cut off the head of that one ewe, I was reborn in Hell. After suffering torment in Hell, because the fruit of my evil deed was not yet exhausted, my own head was cut off just as many times as there were hairs in the ewe’s fleece. Now suppose you kill all these people. When will you ever obtain release from torment? It was because I remembered the great suffering I endured that I wept.” So saying, she recited the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1631]="***Because I cut off the head of one ewe, I suffered as many times as there were hairs in the ewe’s fleece.*";
P_HTM[1632]="***If you cut off the heads of so many living beings, prince, how will you fare?*";
P_HTM[1633]="***“But why do you laugh?” “Because of the joy I feel over having obtained release from this suffering, your majesty.” Again the tree-spirit honored her with a handful of flowers, saying, “Well said! your majesty.”*";
P_HTM[1634]="***The king said, “Oh, what a grievous sin it was that I was minded to commit! Because this queen killed one ewe, she was reborn in Hell. Torment still remaining to her, her head was cut off as many times as there were hairs in the ewe’s fleece. If I kill all these human beings, when shall I ever be purged of my sin?” So he released all the captive kings, paid obeisance to those that were older than he, did honor, with hands reverently clasped, to those that were younger than he, asked them all to forgive him, and sent them back to their own dominions.*";
P_HTM[1635]="***When the Teacher had related this story, he said, “Thus, monks, this was not the first time Mallikā saved the lives of a great number of people by her own wisdom. She did so in a former existence also.” And when he had so said, he identified the characters in the Story of the Past as follows, “At that time the king of Benāres was Pasenadi Kosala, Dinnā was Queen Mallikā, and the tree-spirit was I myself.” And having identified the characters in the Story of the Past, he gave instruction in the Law further, saying, “Monks, it is never lawful to take the life of a living creature. Those who take life sorrow for a long time.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1636]="***If people would understand this, that suffering has here in this world its origin in birth,*";
P_HTM[1637]="***No living being would take the life of another, for he that takes life sorrows.*";
P_HTM[1638]="*[46] 2. Mahākassapattherasaddhivihārikavatthu**2. The Rebellious Pupil*";
P_HTM[1639]="***61. Should a man fail to find a companion who is his better or his equal,*";
P_HTM[1640]="***He should resolutely pursue a solitary course. One cannot be friends with a simpleton.*";
P_HTM[1641]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to a pupil of Elder Kassapa the Great.*";
P_HTM[1642]="***The story goes that while the Elder was in residence at Pipphali Cave, he had two pupils to wait upon him. One of these performed his duties faithfully, but the other frequently shirked his duties and sought to take credit for work really done by his brother-pupil. For example, the faithful pupil would set out water for washing the face, and a tooth-stick. Knowing this, the faithless pupil would go to the Elder and say, “Reverend Sir, water for washing the face is set out, and a tooth-stick. Go wash your face.” And when it was time to prepare water for bathing the feet and for the bath, he would pursue the same tactics.*";
P_HTM[1643]="***The faithful pupil thought to himself, “This fellow is constantly shirking his work and is seeking to take credit for my work. Very well! I will attend to him.” So one day, while the faithless pupil was asleep after a meal, he heated water for the bath, poured it into a water-jar, and set it in the back room, leaving only a pint-pot of water steaming in the boiler. In the evening the faithless pupil woke up and saw steam coming out. “He must have heated water and put it in the bathroom,” thought he. So he went quickly to the Elder, bowed, and said, “Reverend Sir, water has been placed in the bathroom; go and bathe.” So saying, he accompanied the Elder to the bathroom. But when the Elder saw no water, he said, “Brother, where is the water?” The youth went to the room where the fire was kept, and lowering a ladle into the boiler, perceived that it was empty. “See what the rascal has done!” he exclaimed. “He has set an empty boiler on the brazier, and then gone – who knows where? Of course I thought there was water in the bathroom and went and told the Elder so.” Much put out, he took a water-jar and went to the bathing-place on the river.*";
P_HTM[1644]="***When the faithful pupil returned, he brought water from the back room and set it in the bathroom. The Elder thought to himself, “I supposed that this young fellow had heated water for me, for he came to me and said, ‘Water has been placed in the bathroom; come and bathe.’ But just now, in a fit of irritation, he took a water-jar and went to the bathing-place on the river. What can this mean?” After considering the matter, he came to the following conclusion, “All this time this young fellow has been shirking his duties and has sought to take credit for work really done by his brother-pupil.”*";
P_HTM[1645]="***When the faithless pupil returned and sat down, the Elder admonished him, saying, “Brother, a monk ought not to say he has done a thing unless he has done it. For example, just now you came to me and said, ‘Reverend Sir, water has been placed in the bathroom; come and bathe.’ But when I went in, you were annoyed and took a water-jar and went out. One who has become a monk should not do so.” The pupil was highly offended. Said he to himself, “See what the Elder has done! What a way to talk to me just because of a few drops of water!” On the following day he refused to accompany the Elder on his rounds. The Elder therefore took his other pupil with him to a certain place.*";
P_HTM[1646]="***While he was away, the faithless pupil went to the house of a layman who was a supporter of the Elder. The layman asked him, “Reverend Sir, where is the Elder?” “The Elder doesn’t feel well, and therefore remained at the monastery.” “What then should he have, Reverend Sir?” “Give him such and such food,” said the novice, pretending that the Elder had told him to ask for it. Accordingly they prepared food such as he asked for, and gave it to him. He took the food, ate it himself on the way back, and returned to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[1647]="***Now the Elder had received from his supporter robes of great size and fine texture, and these he presented to the novice who accompanied him. The novice dyed them and converted them into under and upper garments for himself. On the following day the Elder went to the house of his supporter. “Reverend Sir,” said they, “your novice told us that you were not feeling well, and therefore we prepared food such as he suggested and sent it to you. Evidently, after eating it, you recovered.” The Elder said nothing, but returned to the monastery. In the evening, when the faithless novice came in and after bowing to him sat down, the Elder said to him, “Brother, yesterday, I am informed, you did such and such. Such conduct ill becomes those who have renounced the world. You should not eat food which you got for another by hinting.”*";
P_HTM[1648]="***The novice was provoked and conceived a grudge against the Elder. He said to himself, “Yesterday, just because of a few drops of water, he called me a liar. To-day, just because I ate a fistful of food his supporter gave me, he said to me, ‘You should not eat food which you got for another by hinting.’ Besides that, he gave an entire set of robes to his other pupil. Oh, the Elder has treated me very badly! I shall find some way of getting even with him.”*";
P_HTM[1649]="***On the following day, when the Elder entered the village for alms, leaving him alone in the monastery, he took a stick, broke all the vessels used for eating and drinking, set fire to the Elder’s hut of leaves and grass, smashed to pieces with a hammer everything that didn’t burn, and ran away. When he died, he was reborn in the Great Hell of Avīci.*";
P_HTM[1650]="***The populace discussed the incident: “They say that a pupil of the Elder, unable to endure a slight rebuke, took offense, set fire to the Elder’s hut of leaves and grass, and ran away.” Some time afterwards a certain monk left Rājagaha, and desiring to see the Teacher, came to Jetavana and paid obeisance to the Teacher. The Teacher greeted him in a friendly manner and asked, “Whence have you come?” “From Rājagaha, Reverend Sir.” “Is all well with my son Kassapa the Great?” “All is well with him, Reverend Sir. But a certain pupil of his, taking offense at a slight rebuke, set fire to his hut of leaves and grass and ran away.” Said the Teacher, “This is not the first time he has taken offense at receiving an admonition. He did the same thing in a previous state of existence also. This is not the first time he has destroyed a house. He did the same thing in a previous state of existence also.” So saying, he related the following*";

P_HTM[1652]="***In times long past, when Brahmadatta reigned at Benāres, a siṅgila bird built him a nest and made his home in the Himālaya country. Now one day, while it was raining, a monkey came there shivering with the cold. The siṅgila saw him and pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1653]="***Monkey, your head and your hands and your feet are just like a man’s.*";
P_HTM[1654]="***What excuse have you, pray, for having no house?*";
P_HTM[1655]="***The monkey thought to himself, “It is true that I have hands and feet; but I lack the intelligence to build a house.” And desiring to make his meaning clear, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1656]="***Siṅgila, my head and my hands and my feet are indeed just like those of a man;*";
P_HTM[1657]="***But as for what they say is man’s highest endowment, intelligence, I have it not.*";
P_HTM[1658]="***The bird thought, “To live in a house would never do for one like you.” And out of scorn for the monkey he pronounced the two following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1659]="***He that is unstable, light-minded, and treacherous.*";
P_HTM[1660]="***He that never keeps the moral precepts, such a one will never attain happiness.*";
P_HTM[1661]="***Monkey, exert yourself to the utmost, abandon your past habits.*";
P_HTM[1662]="***Build yourself a hut to protect yourself from the cold and the wind.*";
P_HTM[1663]="***The monkey said to himself, “This bird calls me unstable, light-minded, treacherous to my friends, one who never keeps the moral precepts. Very well! Now I will show him what happiness is.” So saying, he destroyed the nest and scattered it to the winds. When the monkey seized the nest, the bird slipped out and flew away.*";
P_HTM[1664]="***When the Teacher had given this religious instruction, he identified the characters in the Jātaka as follows, “At that time the monkey was the novice that destroyed the house; the siṅgila bird was Kassapa.” And he said, “Monks, this is not the first time the novice took offense at an admonition and destroyed a house. He did the same thing in a previous state of existence also. It were better for my son Kassapa to live alone than to live with such a simpleton.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

Every fortnight he would gather his kinsfolk together and admonish his son Mūlasiri on these three points: “Do not think that these eighty crores of treasure are a large sum. What one possesses one should never give away. One should always be acquiring more. For if a man lets penny after penny slip through his fingers, slowly but surely his substance wastes away. Therefore it is said,*";
P_HTM[1672]="***Observing how pigments fade away, how ants amass their store,*";
P_HTM[1673]="***How bees gather honey, so should the wise man administer his household.”*";
P_HTM[1674]="***Some time afterwards, after showing his son his five great stores of treasure, he died, given over to pride and stained with the stains of avarice. Now in a certain village near the gate of that city lived a thousand families of Caṇḍālas, and Ānanda was conceived in the womb of one of these Caṇḍāla women. The king, learning of his death, sent for his son Mūlasiri and appointed him to the post of treasurer.*";
P_HTM[1675]="***3 b. Sequel: A Jonah in the house*";
P_HTM[1676]="***These thousand families of Caṇḍālas, who made their living by working for hire in a body, from the day of his conception received no more wages and had not a morsel of rice to sustain them. They said to each other, “Although we are now working, we receive no food. There must be a Jonah amongst us.” So they divided into two groups and made a thorough investigation while his mother and father were absent, and coming to the conclusion, “A Jonah has arisen in this house,” they removed his mother. From the time of his conception she had been able only with great difficulty to procure sufficient food to sustain her. Finally she gave birth to a son.*";
P_HTM[1677]="***His hands and feet and eyes and ears and nose and mouth were not where they should have been. Monstrosity that he was, he looked like a mud sprite and was exceedingly repulsive. In spite of this, however, his mother did not abandon him, for great is the love of a mother for the child she has carried in her womb. She had great difficulty in feeding him. If she took him with her when she went out, she got nothing. But if she left him at home and went out alone, she received food to support her. When he was old enough to get a living by begging alms, she placed a potsherd in his hand and sent him away, saying to him, “Dear son, because of you we have been brought to great distress. Now we can support you no longer. In this city meals are provided for poor folk and travelers. Get your living by begging alms in the city.”*";
P_HTM[1678]="***He went from house to house, finally coming to the house where he had formerly lived in his existence as Treasurer Ānanda. Remembering his former existence, he entered his own house. He went through three chambers, and no one noticed him. But when he entered the fourth chamber, the young sons of Treasurer Mūlasiri took fright and burst into tears. The treasurer’s servants came in and said to him, “Leave this house, unspeakable monster!” So saying, they beat him and pulled him and dragged him out and threw him on the dust-heap.*";
P_HTM[1679]="***As the Teacher was going his round for alms, accompanied by the Elder Ānanda as junior monk, he came to this very place. The Teacher looked at the Elder and, in response to a question, told him what had happened. The Elder sent for Mūlasiri, and a great company of people assembled. The Teacher, addressing Mūlasiri, asked him, “Do you know that man?” “I do not.” “He is your father, Treasurer Ānanda.” Mūlasiri would not believe it. So the Teacher said to Treasurer Ānanda, “Ānanda, point out your five great stores of treasure to your son.” He did so, and Mūlasiri believed and sought refuge in the Teacher. The Teacher, instructing him in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1680]="***62. “I have sons, I have wealth.” With these thoughts the simpleton vexes himself.*";
P_HTM[1681]="***But he is not his own. How then can sons be his? How can wealth be his?*";

P_HTM[1684]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to two thieves who broke their bonds.*";
P_HTM[1685]="***The story goes that these two men, who were boon companions, accompanied a great throng to Jetavana to hear the Law. One of them listened to the Law; the other watched for a chance to steal something. The first, through listening to the Law, obtained the Fruit of Conversion; the second found a matter of five farthings tied to the skirt of a certain man and stole the money. The confirmed thief had food cooked as usual in his house, but there was no cooking done in the house of the convert. His comrade the thief, and likewise the thief’s wife, ridiculed him, saying, “You are so excessively wise that you cannot obtain money enough to have regular meals cooked in your own house.” The convert thought to himself, “This man, just because he is a fool, does not think that he is wise.” And going to Jetavana with his kinsfolk, he told the Teacher of the incident. The Teacher, instructing him in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1686]="***63. The fool who thinks he is a fool is for that very reason a wise man;*";
P_HTM[1687]="***But the fool who thinks he is a wise man is rightly called a fool.*";

P_HTM[1690]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Udāyi.*";
P_HTM[1691]="***The story goes that when the Great Elders left the Hall of Truth, Udāyi used to go in and sit in the Seat of the Law. Now one day some visiting monks saw him there, and thinking to themselves, “This must be the learned Great Elder,” asked him some questions about the Aggregates of Being and other matters. Discovering that he knew nothing about any of these things, they said in scorn, “Who is this monk that he should live in the same monastery with the Buddhas? He does not even know about the Aggregates of Being, the Elements of Being, and the Organs and Objects of Sense.” So they reported the matter to the Tathāgata. The Teacher, instructing them in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1692]="***64. Even if a fool, all his life long, associate with a wise man,*";
P_HTM[1693]="***He will no more perceive the Law than a spoon the taste of broth.*";

P_HTM[1696]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the thirty Pāṭheyyaka monks.*";
P_HTM[1697]="***For the Exalted One first preached the Law to these men in Kappāsika Grove, where they were seeking a woman. At that time all of them obeyed the command, “Come, monks!” and received bowls and robes created by supernatural power. Taking upon themselves the Thirteen Pure Practices, they returned after a long time to the Teacher, hearkened to his discourse on the Beginningless, and before leaving their seats, attained Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[1698]="***The monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “In how short a time did these monks perceive the Law!” The Teacher, hearing this, said to them, “Monks, this is not the first time these thirty companions committed sin. They did the same thing in a previous state of existence also. But hearing the religious instruction of Mahā Tuṇḍila in the Tuṇḍila Jātaka, they perceived the Law very quickly and took upon themselves the Five Precepts. It was solely through the merit acquired by this act that they attained Arahatship just now, even as they sat in their seats.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1699]="***65. If an intelligent man, but for a moment, be associated with a wise man,*";
P_HTM[1700]="***He quickly perceives the Law, just as the tongue perceives the taste of broth.*";

P_HTM[1703]="***Committing evil deeds the fruit whereof is bitter.*";
P_HTM[1704]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the leper Suppabuddha. The story of the leper Suppabuddha is found in the Udāna.*";
P_HTM[1705]="***For at that time the leper Suppabuddha, seated in the outer circle of the congregation, heard the Exalted One preach the Law and attained the Fruit of Conversion. Desiring to inform the Teacher of the blessing he had received, but not daring to force his way into the midst of the congregation, he waited until the populace had paid obeisance to the Teacher, had accompanied him a little way, and had turned back; then he went to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[1706]="***At that moment Sakka king of gods thought to himself, “Yonder leper Suppabuddha desires to make known the blessing he has received in the Religion of the Teacher. I will test him.” So he went to him, and poised in the air, spoke thus to him, “Suppabuddha, you are a poor man, a man afflicted with misery. I will give you limitless wealth if you will say, ‘The Buddha is not the Buddha, the Law is not the Law, the Order is not the Order. I have had enough of the Buddha, I have had enough of the Law, I have had enough of the Order.’ ” The leper said to him, “Who are you?” “I am Sakka.” “Fool, shameless one, you are not fit to talk to me. You say that I am poor and needy and afflicted. On the contrary I have attained happiness and great wealth:*";
P_HTM[1707]="***The wealth of faith, the wealth of morality, the wealth of modesty, of fear of sin,*";
P_HTM[1708]="***The wealth of sacred lore, of renunciation, of wisdom, the seven stores of wealth are mine.*";
P_HTM[1709]="***Whoso possesses these stores of wealth, be it a woman or a man.*";
P_HTM[1710]="***Such a one men call not poor; the life of such a one is not in vain.*";
P_HTM[1711]="***“These are the seven stores of honorable wealth. They that possess these stores of wealth are not called poor by Buddhas or Private Buddhas.” When Sakka heard him speak thus, he left him by the way, went to the Teacher, and told him all the questions and answers. The Exalted One said to him, “Sakka, it is not possible, even with a hundred such pieces of money, even with a thousand, to prevail upon the leper Suppabuddha to say, ‘The Buddha is not the Buddha, the Law is not the Law, the Order is not the Order.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1712]="***So Suppabuddha the leper went to the Teacher, and the Teacher received him in a friendly manner. And having informed the Teacher of the blessing he had received, he arose from his seat and went his way. When he had gone but a little way, he was killed by a young heifer. We are told that this heifer was an ogress who had been a cow in each of a hundred existences, and that as a cow she had killed four youths: Pukkusāti, a young man of station; Bāhiya Dārucīriya; Tambadāṭhika, the robber outlaw and Suppabuddha the leper.*";
P_HTM[1713]="***7 a. Story of the Past: The four youths and the courtezan*";
P_HTM[1714]="***The story goes that in a former state of existence these four youths were sons of wealthy merchants, and the ogress was a beautiful courtezan. One day they accompanied her to a pleasure garden, took their pleasure with her, and when the evening came, decided on the following course of action, “There is no one here except ourselves. We will take from this woman the thousand pieces of money we have given her, rob her of all the jewels she possesses, kill her, and go our way.” The courtezan heard what they said and thought to herself, “These shameless fellows have taken their pleasure with me and now wish to kill me. I will get even with them.” So as they were killing her, she made the following Earnest Wish, “May I become an ogress, and may I be able to kill them, even as they are now killing me.” As the fruit of this Earnest Wish, she killed them.*";
P_HTM[1715]="***Several monks informed the Exalted One of the death of the leper and asked him, “What will be his future state? How did he come to be a leper?” The Teacher explained that since he had attained the Fruit of Conversion, he had been reborn in the World of the Thirty-three.*";
P_HTM[1716]="***7 b. Story of the Past: The insolent youth*";
P_HTM[1717]="***In a previous state of existence, seeing the Private Buddha Tagarasikhi, he showed want of forbearance by spitting on him. He was therefore tormented in Hell for a long period of time, and because the fruit of that evil deed was not yet exhausted, he was reborn as a leper.*";
P_HTM[1718]="***“Monks,” said he, “all living beings in this world reap the bitter fruit of every single evil deed they commit.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1720]="***Committing evil deeds the fruit whereof is bitter.*";
P_HTM[1721]="*[52] 8. Kassakavatthu**8. A Farmer is Unjustly Accused of Theft*";
P_HTM[1722]="***67. That deed is not well done, of which a man must afterwards repent,*";
P_HTM[1723]="***The fruit whereof he receives weeping, with tearful face.*";
P_HTM[1724]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain farmer.*";
P_HTM[1725]="***This farmer, we are told, tilled a certain field not far from Sāvatthi. One day some thieves gained entrance to the city through an underground watercourse, and digging a tunnel into the house of a certain rich man, robbed him of a large amount of gold and coin, escaping through the same watercourse. One of the thieves outwitted his companions and secreted a purse containing a thousand pieces of money in a fold of his garment. Having so done, he accompanied his companions to this field, where they divided their spoils. As the thief departed with his share, the purse dropped out of the fold of his garment, but he did not notice his loss.*";
P_HTM[1726]="***That day, early in the morning, the Teacher surveyed the world, and seeing that this farmer had entered the Net of his Knowledge, he considered within himself what would happen. And he became aware of the following, “This farmer will go early in the morning to till his field. The owners of the stolen property will follow the thieves, and when they see the purse, they will arrest him. Excepting me, he will have no other witness. Since he is predestined to the Path of Conversion, it is my duty to go to him.”*";
P_HTM[1727]="***Early in the morning the farmer went to till his field, and thither went also the Teacher with the Elder Ānanda as attendant-monk. Seeing the Teacher, the farmer went and paid obeisance to the Exalted One, and then resumed tilling his field. The Teacher said nothing to him. Going to the place where the purse had fallen and seeing it, he said to the Elder Ānanda, “See, Ānanda, a poisonous snake!” “I see, Reverend Sir, a deadly, poisonous snake!” The farmer heard their conversation and thought to himself, “In season and out of season I go back and forth over this field. Can there be a snake here, as they say?” The Teacher, after making this remark, went his way. The farmer said to himself, “I will kill the snake.” So saying, he took a goad-stick, went to the spot, and discovered the purse. “The Teacher must have referred to this purse,” thought he. Not knowing exactly what to do about it, he laid the purse aside, covered it with dust, and resumed his plowing.*";
P_HTM[1728]="***When the night grew bright, men discovered the theft which had been committed in the house, trailed the thieves to the field, and coming to the spot where they had divided their spoils, saw the footprints of the farmer. Following his footsteps to the spot where the purse was buried, they removed the earth and picked up the purse. Thereupon they reviled him, saying, “So you robbed the house, and here you are plowing the field!” And having given him a good beating, they took him and arraigned him before the king.*";
P_HTM[1729]="***When the king heard what had happened, he ordered the farmer to be put to death. The king’s men straightway bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution, lashing him with whips as they led him along. As the farmer walked along and the king’s men lashed him with whips, he kept repeating the words, “See, Ānanda, a poisonous snake!” “I see, Reverend Sir, a deadly, poisonous snake!” Not another word did he utter. The king’s men asked him, “You are repeating words of the Teacher and of the Elder Ānanda. What does this mean?” The farmer replied, “I will tell, if I am permitted to see the king.”*";
P_HTM[1730]="***So they led him to the king and told the king what had happened. The king asked the farmer, “Why do you speak thus?” “I am not a thief, your majesty.” So saying, the farmer told him the whole story from the time when he went forth to till his field. When the king had heard his story, he said, “Why, this man names as his witness the foremost man in all the world, the Teacher. It is not right to fasten the guilt upon him. I shall find some way out of this difficulty.”*";
P_HTM[1731]="***Accordingly, when it was evening, the king took the farmer with him, went to the Teacher, and asked him, “Exalted One, did you and the Elder Ānanda go to a place where a certain farmer was plowing?” “Yes, your majesty.” “What did you see there?” “A purse containing a thousand pieces of money, your majesty.” “When you saw it, what did you say?” “Such and such, your majesty.” “Reverend Sir, if this man had not named a person like you as his witness, he would never have saved his life. He saved his life by repeating the words you uttered.” When the Teacher heard this, he said, “Yes, your majesty, I also said just that when I went there. A wise man should not do a deed of which he must afterwards repent.” And joining the connection, he instructed him in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1732]="***67. That deed is not well done, of which a man must afterwards repent,*";
P_HTM[1733]="***The fruit whereof he receives weeping, with tearful face.*";
P_HTM[1734]="*[53] 9. Sumanamālākāravatthu**9. Sumana the Gardener*";

P_HTM[1736]="***The fruit whereof one receives with joy and pleasure.*";
P_HTM[1737]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the gardener Sumana.*";
P_HTM[1738]="***We are told that every day, early in the morning, the gardener Sumana used to serve King Bimbisāra with eight measures of jasmine flowers, for each of which he received eight pieces of money. Now one day, just as he was entering the city with the flowers, the Exalted One, surrounded by a mighty retinue of monks, diffusing rays of six colors, with all the mighty power of a Buddha, entered the city for alms. (Sometimes the Exalted One proceeds like any other monk on an alms pilgrimage, concealing the six-colored rays with his robe, as when he went a journey of three leagues to meet Aṅgulimāla. At other times, as when he enters Kapilavatthu and other cities, he diffuses rays of six colors from his person. On this particular day, diffusing rays of six colors from his person, with all the mighty power of a Buddha, with all the grace of a Buddha, he entered Rājagaha.)*";
P_HTM[1739]="***When the gardener saw the person of the Exalted One, as it had been an oblation of precious stones, an oblation of gold, and beheld the glory and splendor of the thirty-two major characteristics and the eighty minor characteristics of a great man, he thought to himself, “What good office can I perform for the Teacher?” Seeing nothing better to do, he thought, “I will honor the Teacher with these flowers.” Then he thought again, “These are the flowers with which I always serve the king. If he fails to receive them, he may put me in prison or kill me or banish me. What am I to do?” Then this thought occurred to him, “Let the king kill me or banish me from his kingdom. No matter what he gives me, he can give me wealth which will last only so long as my life endures in this present existence. But if I honor the Teacher, it will avail to my welfare and salvation in untold millions of cycles of time.” Therefore he surrendered his life to the Tathāgata.*";
P_HTM[1740]="***Thought he, “So long as my believing heart turns not back, I will do him honor.” And pleased and delighted, elated and happy, he honored the Teacher. How did he do it? First he threw two handfuls of flowers over the Teacher. These remained suspended over his head like a canopy. Then he threw two handfuls more, which descended on his right side and remained suspended like the curtain of a pavilion. The next two handfuls he threw descended behind him and remained suspended. The last two handfuls he threw descended on his left side and remained suspended. Thus the eight measures of flowers, eight handfuls in all, surrounded the Tathāgata on four sides.*";
P_HTM[1741]="***In front it was as if there were a gate for him to enter; the stems of the flowers were turned inward, and the petals were turned outward. The Exalted One proceeded as if he were encased in plates of silver. The flowers, senseless things though they were, behaved as though possessed of intelligence, neither breaking apart nor falling, accompanying the Teacher whenever he moved, and remaining stationary whenever he stood still. From the person of the Teacher proceeded rays like the hundred forks of lightning; in front and behind, on his right hand and on his left, and from the crown of his head did rays of light flash forth.*";
P_HTM[1742]="***Not one who met him face to face, as he proceeded, ran away, but all without exception walked thrice about him sunwise, and in numbers like clusters of young palm-trees ran before him. The whole city was agitated. There were ninety million people living in the city at this time and ninety million people living outside of the city; and of these one hundred and eighty million people there was not one man or woman who did not come forth bringing alms. Roaring the roar of lions and waving thousands of cloths, the great multitude marched before the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[1743]="***In order to make known the meritorious deed of the gardener, the Teacher proceeded through the city for a distance of three leagues to the beating of kettle-drums. The whole body of the gardener was suffused with the five sorts of joy. After accompanying the Tathāgata a little way, he penetrated the rays of the Buddha as one might plunge into a sea of vermilion, praised the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and then taking his empty basket, went home.*";
P_HTM[1744]="***His wife asked him, “Where are your flowers?” “I honored the Teacher with them.” “Now what will you do for the king?” “The king may kill me or banish me from his kingdom. I have surrendered my life to the Teacher and rendered him honor. I had eight handfuls of flowers in all, and with these I honored the Teacher. The populace is accompanying the Teacher, shouting thousands of acclamations. It is the noise of the acclamations of the populace that we hear in this place.”*";
P_HTM[1745]="***Now the wife of the gardener was an utter simpleton, and was therefore incapable of believing in such a miracle. So she rebuked her husband, saying, “Kings are harsh and cruel, and when once provoked, do much harm by cutting off hands and feet and inflicting other punishments. Much harm might come to me through what you have done.” Then she took her children with her, went to the royal palace, sent for the king, and when he asked her what was the matter, said to him, “My husband has honored the Teacher with the flowers he should have served to you and has returned home empty-handed. I asked him what he had done with the flowers, and this is what he told me. I rebuked him, saying, ‘Kings are harsh and cruel, and when once provoked, do much harm by cutting off hands and feet and inflicting other punishments. Much harm might come to me through the offense you have committed.’ So I abandoned him and came here. What he has done may be good or evil. All that I care for, your majesty, is to have you know that I have abandoned him.”*";
P_HTM[1746]="***Now the king was a Noble Disciple. At the very first sight of the Buddha he had obtained the Fruit of Conversion; his faith was firm and his mind was at peace. He thought to himself, “Oh, this woman is an utter simpleton! Naturally she could have no faith in such a work of merit.” But he pretended to be angry and said to her, “Woman, what say you? He honored the Teacher with flowers he should have served to me?” “Yes, your majesty.” “You did well to abandon him. I shall find a way of dealing with this fellow for rendering honor to another with flowers that belonged to me.” Having dismissed her with these words, he went quickly to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and walked with the Teacher alone.*";
P_HTM[1747]="***The Teacher, perceiving that the mind of the king was at peace, proceeded to the city and marched through the street to the beating of kettle-drums, until he arrived at the gate of the king’s palace. The king took his bowl and invited the Teacher to enter, but the Teacher indicated his desire to sit in the palace court. The king recognized his desire and gave the order, “Erect a pavilion with all speed.” Accordingly a pavilion was immediately erected, and the Teacher sat therein, surrounded by the Congregation of Monks.*";
P_HTM[1748]="***Now why did the Teacher not enter the king’s palace? We are told that the following thought occurred to him, “If I go in and sit down, the populace will not be able to see me, and the good deed of the gardener will not be manifest; but if I sit in the palace court, the populace will be able to see me, and the good deed of the gardener will become manifest to all.” (For the Buddhas alone have the courage to publish abroad the virtues of the virtuous; other folk display jealousy in reciting the virtues of the virtuous.)*";
P_HTM[1749]="***The four banks of flowers remained suspended on four sides. The populace waited upon the Teacher, and the king served the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha with choice food. At the conclusion of the meal the Teacher returned thanks, and surrounded as before by the four banks of flowers and accompanied by a great multitude shouting shouts of exultation, proceeded to the monastery.*";
P_HTM[1750]="***The king accompanied the Teacher a little way and turned back. Then he sent for the gardener and asked him, “What did you say when you honored the Teacher?” The gardener replied, “Your majesty, I surrendered my life to him and honored him, saying, ‘The king may kill me or banish me from his kingdom.’ ” The king said, “You are a great man.” So saying, he presented him with eight elephants, eight horses, eight male slaves, eight female slaves, eight magnificent sets of jewels, eight thousand pieces of money, eight women taken from the royal harem, adorned with all the adornments, and eight choice villages. These Eightfold Gifts did the king give him.*";
P_HTM[1751]="***The Elder Ānanda thought to himself, “Shouts of exultation and acclamation have continued all during the day since early morning. What will be the reward of the gardener?” So he asked the Teacher the question. The Teacher replied, “Ānanda, think not that it was a little thing this gardener did. For he surrendered his life to me and rendered honor to me. Therefore, because he reposed faith in me, he will not enter a state of suffering for a hundred thousand cycles of time, but will receive the fruit of his good deed in the World of the Gods and in the world of men and will become a Private Buddha named Sumana.”*";
P_HTM[1752]="***When the Teacher returned to the monastery and entered his Perfumed Chamber, those flowers fell upon the battlement.*";
P_HTM[1753]="***In the evening the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “Oh, how wonderful was the deed of the gardener! He surrendered his life to the living Buddha, rendered him honor with flowers, and straightway received eightfold gifts.” The Teacher came forth from his Perfumed Chamber, proceeded to the Hall of Truth by one of three passageways, and seating himself in the Seat of the Buddha, asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said to them, “Yes, monks, one should do only deeds the doing of which is not followed by remorse, but every remembrance of which brings only joy.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1754]="***68. That deed is well done the doing of which is not followed by remorse,*";
P_HTM[1755]="***The fruit whereof one receives with joy and pleasure.*";
P_HTM[1756]="*[54] 10. Uppalavaṇṇattherīvatthu**10. Rape of Uppalavaṇṇā*";
P_HTM[1757]="***69. As sweet as honey, thinks a fool an evil deed, so long as it bears no fruit;*";
P_HTM[1758]="***But when it bears fruit, then the fool comes to grief.*";
P_HTM[1759]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun Uppalavaṇṇā.*";
P_HTM[1760]="***We are told that Uppalavaṇṇā made her Earnest Wish at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara, and that after performing works of merit for a hundred thousand cycles of time, as she passed from birth to birth among gods and men, she passed from the World of the Gods in the dispensation of the present Buddha and was reborn in Sāvatthi as the daughter of a rich merchant. The hue of her skin was like the hue of the calyx of the blue lotus, and therefore they gave her the name Uppalavaṇṇā. When she reached marriageable age, all the princes and merchants in the Land of the Rose-Apple, without a single exception, sent to the merchant her father, asking him to give them his daughter in marriage.*";
P_HTM[1761]="***Thereupon the merchant thought to himself, “I shall not be able to satisfy the wishes of all, but I shall find some way out of the difficulty.” So he summoned his daughter and said to her, “You might become a nun.” Now she was in her last existence before attaining Nibbāna, and therefore his words were to her as it were oil a hundred times refined, sprinkled on her head. Therefore she replied, “Dear father, I will become a nun.” So he prepared rich gifts in her honor, and conducting her to the Community of Nuns, had her admitted to the Order.*";
P_HTM[1762]="***Not long after she had been admitted to the Order, her turn came to unlock and lock the Hall of Confession. After she had lighted the lamp and swept the Hall, her attention was attracted to the flame of the lamp. And standing there, she looked repeatedly at the flame; and concentrating her attention on the element of fire, entered into a state of trance. Consummating the trance, she attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties and Powers.*";
P_HTM[1763]="***Some time later she went on a pilgrimage for alms in the country, and on her return entered a dark forest. At that time it was not forbidden for nuns to reside in a forest. There they built her a hut, set up a bed, and hung curtains round. From the forest she went to Sāvatthi to receive alms, and then set out to return to her hut. Now a cousin of hers, a young Brahman named Ānanda, had been in love with her ever since she lived in the world; and when he heard where she had gone, he went to the forest ahead of the nun, entered the hut, and hid under the bed.*";
P_HTM[1764]="***On her return the nun entered the hut, closed the door, and sat down on the bed, unable to see in the dark, because she had just come in out of the sunlight. Hardly had she seated herself on the bed when the youth crawled out from under and climbed on top. The nun cried out, “Fool, do not ruin me! Fool, do not ruin me!” But the youth overcame her resistance, worked his will of her, and went his way. As if unable to endure his wickedness, the great earth burst asunder, and he was swallowed up and reborn in the Great Hell of Avīci.*";
P_HTM[1765]="***The nun told the other nuns what had happened, and the nuns told the monks, and the monks told the Exalted One. Having heard this, the Teacher addressed the monks as follows, “Monks, the simpleton, whoever he may be, whether monk or nun, or lay disciple male or female, who commits an act of sin, acts with as much joy and happiness, with as much pleasure and delight, as though he were eating honey or sugar or some other sweet-tasting substance.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1766]="***69. As sweet as honey, thinks a fool an evil deed, so long as it bears no fruit;*";
P_HTM[1767]="***But when it bears fruit, then the fool comes to grief.*";
P_HTM[1768]="***Some time later the throng assembled in the Hall of Truth began to discuss the incident: “Even those that have rid themselves of the Depravities like the pleasures of love and gratify their passions. Why should they not? They are not kolapa-trees or ant-hills, but are living creatures with bodies of moist flesh. Therefore they also like the pleasures of love and gratify their passions.” The Teacher drew near and asked them, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” They told him. Then he said, “Monks, they that have rid themselves of the Depravities neither like the pleasures of love nor gratify their passions. For even as a drop of water which has fallen upon a lotus-leaf does not cling thereto or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, even as a grain of mustard-seed does not cling to the point of an awl or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, precisely so twofold love does not cling to the heart of one who has rid himself of the Depravities or remain there.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza, found in the Brāhmaṇa Vagga,*";
P_HTM[1769]="***401. Even as water does not cling to a lotus-leaf, nor a grain of mustard-seed to the point of an awl.*";
P_HTM[1770]="***Whoso in like manner clings not to the pleasures of sense, him I call a Brahman.*";
P_HTM[1771]="***Now the Teacher summoned King Pasenadi Kosala and said to him, “Your majesty, in this Religion young women of family, as well as young men of family, renounce many kinsfolk and much wealth, retire from the world, and take up residence in the forest. In case women reside in the forest, it is possible that evil-minded men, inflamed by lust, may conduct themselves towards them with disrespect and arrogance, do them violence, and bring their religious life to naught. Therefore a place of residence for the Community of Nuns should be erected within the city.” The king agreed to this and had a place of residence for the Community of Nuns erected on one side of the city. From that time on the nuns resided only within the city.*";

P_HTM[1774]="***Yet is he not worth a sixteenth part of them that have well weighed the Law.*";
P_HTM[1775]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Jambuka, the Naked Ascetic.*";
P_HTM[1776]="***11 a. Story of the Past: The jealous monk*";
P_HTM[1777]="***The story goes that in times long past, in the dispensation of the Supremely Enlightened Kassapa, a certain layman dwelling in a village erected a residence for a certain Elder, and supplied him with the four requisites during his term of residence there, the Elder taking his meals regularly in the layman’s house. Now a certain monk freed from the Depravities, making his round for alms by day, stopped at the door of the layman’s house. When the layman saw him, pleased with his deportment, he invited him into his house, and reverently served him with the choicest viands. And he presented him with a large robe, saying, “Reverend Sir, dye this robe and wear it as an undergarment.” And he said further to him, “Reverend Sir, your hair has grown long; I will go fetch a barber to cut your hair. And on my return I will procure you a bed for you to lie on.”*";
P_HTM[1778]="***When the monk who was the layman’s guest, and who took his meals regularly in the layman’s house, saw the attentions bestowed on the visiting monk by the layman, he became very jealous. And as he went to his residence, he thought to himself, “This moment this layman is devoting all his attentions to this visiting monk. But to me, who take my meals in his house regularly, he pays no attention at all.” The visiting monk, who was his sole companion, dyed the robe which the layman had given him, and put it on and wore it as an undergarment. The layman brought the barber back with him and had him cut the Elder’s hair. Having so done, he caused a bed to be spread for the Elder and said to him, “Reverend Sir, lie on this very bed.” Then, after inviting the two Elders to be his guests on the morrow, he departed.*";
P_HTM[1779]="***The resident monk could endure no longer the attentions bestowed by the layman on the visiting monk. So in the evening he went to the place where the Elder lay, and reviled him by uttering the four kinds of insults: “Brother visitor, you might better eat excrement than eat food in the layman’s house. You might better tear out your hair with a Palmyra comb than allow your hair to be cut by a barber brought hither by the layman. You might better go naked than wear as an undergarment a robe given you by the layman. You might better lie on the ground than lie on a bed brought you by the layman.” Thought the visiting Elder, “May this foolish fellow not be destroyed because of me!” Paying no attention to the insults of the resident monk, he arose early in the morning and went whithersoever he wished.*";
P_HTM[1780]="***The resident monk also arose early in the morning, and performed the customary duties about his residence. When it was time for him to set out on his round for alms, thinking to himself, “The visiting Elder is undoubtedly asleep now, and will awaken at the sound of the bell,” he struck the bell with the outer surface of his finger nail. Having so done, he entered the village. After preparing offerings of food, the layman watched for the two Elders to come. Seeing the resident monk, he asked, “Reverend Sir, where is the visiting Elder?” The resident monk replied, “Brother, what say you? The Elder who came to your house yesterday went into an inner room as soon as you departed, and fell asleep. Although I rose very early, he pays no attention either to the noise of my sweeping the residence, or to the sound of the washing of the jars for water for drinking and for refreshment, or to the stroke of the bell.”*";
P_HTM[1781]="***Thought the layman to himself, “It is incredible that my noble Elder, a monk so perfect in deportment, should sleep until this time of day. It must be that the Venerable Elder resident in my household, observing my attentions to him, said something to him.” Accordingly, wise man that he was, the layman reverently served the resident monk with food; and having so done, washed his bowl carefully, filled it with food flavored with the choicest gravies, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, should you happen to see my noble Elder, be good enough to give him this food.” The monk took the bowl and thought to himself, “If the Elder eats such food as this, he will take such a liking to this spot that he will never leave it.” So as he went along the road, he threw away that food. When he reached the Elder’s place of residence, he looked for him there, but failed to find him.*";
P_HTM[1782]="***Now because the monk committed this evil deed, the meditations he performed for so long as twenty thousand years were powerless to protect him. When the term of his life was completed, he was reborn in the Avīci Hell, where he suffered extreme torment for the space of an interval between two Buddhas. In the dispensation of the present Buddha he was reborn in the city of Rājagaha in a certain household possessed of an abundant store of food and drink.*";
P_HTM[1783]="***11b. Story of the Present: Jambuka the Naked Ascetic*";
P_HTM[1784]="***From the time he could walk, he would neither lie on a bed nor eat ordinary food, but ate only his own excrement. His mother and father brought him up, thinking, “He does this because he is too young to know any better.” But also when he grew older, refusing to wear clothes, he went naked, made his bed on the ground, and ate only his own excrement. Thought his mother and father, “This youth is not fit to live in a house. He is fit to live only with the Naked Ascetics, the Ājīvakas.” So they took him to the Ājīvakas and committed him to their charge, saying, “Admit this youth to your Order.” So they admitted him to their Order. In admitting him they placed him in a pit up to his neck, laid planks over his two collarbones, and seating themselves on the planks, pulled out his hair with Palmyra combs. His mother and father invited the Ājīvakas to be their guests on the following day and departed.*";
P_HTM[1785]="***On the following day the Ājīvakas said to him, “Come, let us go into the village.” But he refused to go, saying, “You go, but I shall remain right here. They repeatedly urged him to accompany them, but he refused to do so, and they left him behind and went their way. When he knew they were gone, he removed a plank from the public jakes, and descending therein, took up excrement in both his hands, molded it into lumps, and ate it. The Ājīvakas sent him food from the village, but he refused to eat it. Repeatedly urged to do so, he said, “I have no need of this food; I get food of my own.” “Where do you get it?” said they. “Right here,” said he. Likewise on the second day and on the third and on the fourth he refused, in spite of much urging, to accompany them to the village, saying, “I shall remain right here.”*";
P_HTM[1786]="***Said the Ājīvakas, “Day after day this man refuses to accompany us to the village. Likewise he will have none of the food we send him and says, ‘Right here I procure food of my own.’ What can he be doing? Let us watch him and find out for ourselves.” So when they went to the village, they left two of their number behind to watch him. These men pretended to follow in the train of the other monks and then went and hid themselves. As soon as he thought they had gone, he descended as before into the jakes and began to eat excrement. When the spies saw what he was doing, they told the Ājīvakas. As soon as the Ājīvakas heard the news, they said to themselves, “Oh, what an outrageous thing he has done! If the disciples of the monk Gotama should learn of this, they would circulate evil report of us, saying, ‘The Ājīvakas make a practice of eating excrement.’ This man is not fit to remain with us.” So they expelled him from their Order.*";
P_HTM[1787]="***Now the public jakes was a pool of considerable size, formed by a depression in the surface of a flat rock. When Jambuka had been expelled by the Ājīvakas, he used to go by night to the public jakes and eat filth. When people came to ease themselves, he would stand leaning with one hand on one side of the rock, with one foot raised and resting on his knee, with his mouth wide open, facing in the direction of the wind. When people saw him, they would approach and salute him and ask him, “Reverend Sir, why does your noble self stand there with mouth wide open?” “I am a wind-eater,” Jambuka would reply; “I have no other food.” “But, Reverend Sir, why do you stand with one foot resting on your knee?” “I am a man who practices cruel austerities, dreadful austerities. If I walk with my two feet, the earth quakes. Therefore I stand with one foot resting on my knee. I spend my life in a standing posture, never sitting and never lying down.”*";
P_HTM[1788]="***For the most part men believed whatever he said. Therefore all the inhabitants of Aṅga and Magadha were greatly agitated and said, “Oh, how wonderful are such ascetics as these! Never before have we seen such ascetics!” And month after month they brought him abundant food. But he was unwilling to accept anything they brought him and said, “I eat only the wind. I have no other food; for were I to eat any other food, it would make an end of my austerities.” But the people replied, “Reverend Sir, do not destroy us. If only an austere ascetic like you would partake of food at our hands, it would insure our welfare and salvation for a long period of time.” They asked him repeatedly, but other food did not please him. But finally, under the pressure of their entreaties, he placed on the tip of his tongue with the tip of a blade of kusa grass some butter, honey, and molasses they brought him, and dismissed them with the following words, “Go your way now; this will suffice to your welfare and salvation.” In this manner he spent fifty-five years, going naked, eating excrement, tearing out his hair, and making his bed on the ground.*";
P_HTM[1789]="***It is the invariable practice of the Buddhas to survey the world at dawn. Therefore one day, as the Buddha surveyed the world, this Naked Ascetic Jambuka entered the Net of his Knowledge. “What will happen?” pondered the Teacher. Straightway he perceived that Jambuka possessed the dispositions requisite for the attainment of Arahatship with the Supernatural Faculties. And he became aware of the following, “I will pronounce a single Stanza, and at the conclusion of the Stanza, beginning with this ascetic, eighty-four thousand living beings will obtain Comprehension of the Law. Through this man a great multitude will win Salvation.”*";
P_HTM[1790]="***On the following day the Teacher made his round for alms in Rājagaha, and when he had returned from his round, he said to the Elder Ānanda, “Ānanda, I intend to go to the Naked Ascetic Jambuka.” “Reverend Sir, can it be that you intend to go to him?” “Yes, Ānanda, I do.” Having so said, as the shadows of evening lengthened, the Teacher set out to go to him. Thereupon the deities thought, “The Teacher is going to visit the Naked Ascetic Jambuka. Now Jambuka lives on a flat rock polluted by excrement, urine, and toothsticks. We must therefore cause rain to fall.” So by their own supernatural power they caused rain to fall, though but for a moment. Immediately the flat rock was pure and spotless. For the deities caused the five kinds of rain to fall upon that rock.*";
P_HTM[1791]="***In the evening, therefore, the Teacher went to the Naked Ascetic Jambuka. And making a slight noise, he said, “Jambuka!” Jambuka thought to himself, “What wicked fellow is this that addresses me as Jambuka?” And he replied, “Who is it?” “It is I, a monk.” “What do you wish, great monk?” “Give me lodging here for just one night.” “There is no lodging to be had here, great monk.” “Jambuka, do not act thus; give me lodging for just one night. For monks seek the society of a monk, men the society of men, and animals the society of animals.” “But are you a monk?” “Yes, I am a monk.” “If you are a monk, where is your gourd, where is your wooden spoon, where is your sacrificial thread?” “All these I use; but because I find it troublesome to carry them about with me to every place I visit, I obtain them within and take them with me when I go.” At this Jambuka was offended and said, “So you intend to take them with you when you go?” Then said the Teacher to him, “Never mind, Jambuka; tell me where I can find lodging.” “There is no lodging to be had here, great monk.”*";
P_HTM[1792]="***Now there was a certain mountain-cave not far from Jambuka’s place of abode; and the Teacher, pointing to it, asked, “Is there anyone who lives in that mountain-cave?” “No one lives there, great monk.” “Well then, permit me to lodge there.” “Suit yourself, great monk.” So the Teacher prepared a bed in the mountain-cave and lay down. In the first watch the Four Great Kings came to wait upon the Teacher, illuminating the four quarters with one blaze of light. Jambuka saw the light and thought to himself, “What is that light?” In the second watch came Sakka king of the gods. Jambuka saw him and thought to himself, “Who is that?” In the third and last watch drew near Mahā Brahmā, who with one finger can illuminate one Cakkavāḷa, with two fingers two Cakkavāḷas, and with ten fingers ten, illuminating the whole forest. Jambuka saw him also and thought to himself, “Who can that be?”*";
P_HTM[1793]="***So early the next morning he went to the Teacher, greeted him in a friendly manner, and taking his stand respectfully on one side, asked the Teacher, “Great monk, who were they that came to you, illuminating the four quarters as they came?” “The Four Great Kings.” “Why did they come to you?” “To wait upon me.” “But are you superior to the Four Great Kings?” “Yes, Jambuka, I am Sovereign Lord of the Four Great Kings.” “And who was it that came to you in the second watch?” “Sakka king of the gods.” “Why did he come to you?” “He came also to wait upon me.” “But are you superior to Sakka king of the gods?” “Yes, Jambuka, I am superior to Sakka. Indeed, Sakka stands to me in the relation of a novice, as it were; one who does for me anything I need to have done; my physician in time of sickness.” “Who was it that came to you in the third and last watch, illuminating the whole forest as he came?” “That was Mahā Brahmā, to whom blundering, stumbling Brahmans and others cry, ‘Praise be to Mahā Brahmā!’ ” “But are you superior also to Mahā Brahmā?” “Yes, Jambuka, for I am he that is Brahmā over Brahmā.”*";
P_HTM[1794]="***“You are a wonderful person, great monk. But I have dwelt here for fifty-five years, and in all these years not a single person has come to wait upon me; indeed, during all this period of time I have lived upon the wind and have remained in a standing posture, and yet none have come to wait upon me.” Then said the Teacher to him, “Jambuka, you have succeeded in deceiving the foolish multitude living in the world, and now you are attempting to deceive me. Is it not a fact that during these fifty-five years you have eaten excrement, made your bed upon the ground, gone naked, and pulled out your hair with a Palmyra comb? But you have deceived the world, saying, ‘My food is the wind; I stand on one foot; I sit not down; I lie not down.’ Now you are seeking to deceive me also. It is because of the low, false views which you held in a previous state of existence that you have all this time eaten excrement, made your bed upon the ground, gone naked, and pulled out your hair with a Palmyra comb. So also now you hold only low, false views.” “But, great monk, what was it I did in a previous state of existence?” Then the Teacher related to him the evil deed he had committed in a previous state of existence.*";
P_HTM[1795]="***As the Teacher related the story to him, he was deeply moved, a sense of modesty and fear of mortal sin sprang up within him, and he crouched upon the ground. The Teacher tossed him a bath-robe, and he put it on. Then he saluted the Teacher and sat down respectfully on one side. When the Teacher had completed his story of Jambuka’s former deed, he preached the Law to him. At the conclusion of the Teacher’s discourse he attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties. Then, saluting the Teacher, he arose from his seat and asked the Teacher to admit him and to profess him as a member of the Order.*";
P_HTM[1796]="***Thus finally was exhausted the demerit he acquired by an evil deed committed in a previous state of existence. For this Jambuka, by reason of the four insults with which he had insulted a Great Elder who was an Arahat, was tormented in the Avīci Hell until this great earth was elevated a league and three quarters; and because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted, he lived in shame for fifty-five years. But because this evil deed, once the fruit thereof was exhausted, could not destroy the fruit of the meditations which he had performed for twenty thousand years, therefore was it that the Teacher stretched forth his right hand to him and said, “Come, monk! lead the holy life.” At that moment his characteristics as a layman vanished, and he took on the form of an Elder sixty years old, furnished with the Eight Requisites.*";
P_HTM[1797]="***We are told that this was the day when the inhabitants of Aṅga and Magadha came to him with offerings. When, therefore, the inhabitants of both kingdoms came to him with offerings and saw the Tathāgata, they thought, “Which is the greater of the two, our noble ascetic Jambuka or the monk Gotama?” And they came to the following conclusion, “Were the hermit Gotama the greater, this ascetic would go to the monk Gotama. But by reason of the superior greatness of the Naked Ascetic Jambuka, the monk Gotama has come to him.” When the Teacher perceived the thought of the multitude, he said, “Jambuka, resolve the doubt of your supporters.”*";
P_HTM[1798]="***“Reverend Sir,” replied Jambuka, “this is the very thing I should most like to do.” And forthwith entering into the fourth trance and arising therefrom, he soared into the air to the height of a palmyra-tree. Then he cried out, “Reverend Sir, the Exalted One is my Teacher, and I am his disciple.” Then he descended to the ground and saluted the Teacher. After that, again soaring into the air to the height of two palmyra-trees, then to the height of three palmyra-trees, and so on to the height of seven palmyra-trees, he proclaimed his own discipleship and descended.*";
P_HTM[1799]="***When the multitude saw this, they thought, “Oh, wonderful indeed and of lofty powers are the Buddhas!” Thereupon the Teacher addressed the multitude, saying, “All this time has this ascetic lived here, placing on the tip of his tongue with the tip of a blade of kusa grass the food which you have brought to him, and saying, ‘Thus I am fulfilling the duties of an ascetic.’ But were he now to abstain from food through a feeling of remorse, these ascetic practices would not be worth a sixteenth part of the meritorious thought which actuates him to abstain from food.” And joining the connection, he expounded the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1800]="***70. Though month after month with the tip of a blade of kusa grass a simpleton should eat his food,*";
P_HTM[1801]="***Yet is he not worth a sixteenth part of them that have well weighed the Law.*";

P_HTM[1804]="***It follows the doer, the simpleton, to consume him, like fire covered with ashes.*";
P_HTM[1805]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to a certain snake-ghost.*";
P_HTM[1806]="***For on a certain day, in the midst of a thousand ascetics wearing matted hair, the Venerable Elder Lakkhaṇa and the Venerable Elder Moggallāna the Great descended from Vulture Peak with the intention of making an alms-pilgrimage in Rājagaha. The Venerable Elder Moggallāna the Great, seeing a snake-ghost, smiled. Thereupon Elder Lakkhaṇa asked him the reason for his smile, saying, “Brother, why do you smile?” Said Elder Moggallāna the Great, “Brother, it is not the proper time for you to ask that question. Wait until we are in the presence of the Exalted One and then ask me.” When they had completed their rounds for alms in Rājagaha and had come into the presence of the Teacher and had sat down. Elder Lakkhaṇa asked Elder Moggallāna, “Brother Moggallāna, as you were descending from Vulture Peak, you smiled; and when I asked you the reason for your smile, you said, ‘Wait until we are in the presence of the Teacher and then ask me.’ Now tell me the reason.”*";
P_HTM[1807]="***Said the Elder, “Brother, I smiled because I saw a snake-ghost. This is what he looked like: his head was like the head of a man, and the rest of his body was like that of a snake. He was what is called a snake-ghost. He was twenty-five leagues in length. Flames of fire started from his head and went as far as his tail; flames of fire started from his tail and went as far as his head. Flames of fire starting from his head played on both sides of his body; flames of fire starting from his sides descended on his body. There are two ghosts, they say, whose length is twenty-five leagues, the length of the rest being three-quarters of a league. But the length of this snake-ghost and of this crow-ghost was twenty-five leagues.” So much for the snake-ghost.*";
P_HTM[1808]="***On another occasion Moggallāna saw a crow-ghost enduring torment on the summit of Vulture Peak. And he asked the ghost about his former deed, pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1809]="***Your tongue is five leagues long, your head is nine leagues long.*";
P_HTM[1810]="***Your body rises twenty-five leagues above the earth;*";
P_HTM[1811]="***What was the deed you did to meet with such suffering as this?*";
P_HTM[1812]="***Said the ghost, answering his question,*";
P_HTM[1813]="***Reverend Moggallāna, I carried away to my heart’s content, food*";
P_HTM[1814]="***Brought to a company of monks of the mighty sage Kassapa.*";
P_HTM[1815]="***12 a. Story of the Past: The crow-ghost*";
P_HTM[1816]="***Reverend Sir, in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, a company of monks entered a village for alms. When the villagers saw the Elders, they received them cordially, provided seats for them in a rest-house, furnished them with rice-porridge, gave them hard food, and bathed their feet and anointed them with oil. And while waiting for the time to come to give alms, they sat and listened to the Law. At the conclusion of the recitation of the Law they took the Elders’ bowls, filled them in their several houses with food flavored with various choice flavors, and returned with them.*";
P_HTM[1817]="***At that time I was a crow, perched on the ridge-pole of the rest-house. When I saw what was happening, I filled my mouth thrice out of the bowl taken by one of those villagers, taking three mouthfuls of food. Now that food did not belong to the company of monks, nor was it given and handed over to the company of monks. It was simply and solely the remains of food taken by the monks which the villagers would have carried to their own houses and eaten, and was brought forth merely on the occasion of the visit of the monks. Well, I took three mouthfuls; that was the extent of my misdeed in a former state of existence. As the result of that misdeed, when I died, I suffered torment in the Avīci Hell; and thereafter, because the fruit of my evil deed was not yet exhausted, I was reborn on Vulture Peak as a crow-ghost. Now as the fruit of my evil deed, I endure this suffering. End of Story of the crow-ghost.*";
P_HTM[1818]="***At this point, then, the Elder said, “I smiled because I saw a snake-ghost.” Straightway the Teacher arose and witnessed to the truth of Moggallāna’s statement, saying, “Monks, what Moggallāna says is the exact truth. I myself saw this very ghost on the day I attained Enlightenment. But out of compassion for others, I did not say, ‘As for those who will not believe my words, may it be to their disadvantage.’ ” (According to the Lakkhaṇa Saṁyutta, when Moggallāna the Great saw the ghost, the Teacher became his witness and told twenty stories.) When the monks heard what he said, they inquired about his deed in a former state of existence. Thereupon the Teacher related the following*";
P_HTM[1819]="***12 b. Story of the Past: The snake-ghost*";
P_HTM[1820]="***The story goes that in times long past men erected a bower of leaves and grass on the bank of the river near Benāres for a Private Buddha. During his residence there the Private Buddha regularly went to the city for alms, and the residents of the city, in the evening and in the morning, took perfumes and garlands in their hands and went and ministered to the Private Buddha. Now a certain resident of Benāres was plowing a field near the wayside, and as the multitude passed by in the evening and in the morning to do service to the Private Buddha, they trampled his field. The farmer tried to prevent them from so doing, saying to them, “Do not trample my field,” but in spite of his best efforts, was unable to do so. Finally the following thought occurred to him, “If the bower of the Private Buddha were not in this place, they would not trample my field.” Accordingly, when the Private Buddha had entered the city for alms, the farmer broke all of his vessels for eating and drinking and set fire to his bower of leaves and grass.*";
P_HTM[1821]="***When the Private Buddha saw his bower burned down, he wandered forth at his own good pleasure. When the multitude drew near with perfumes and garlands and saw the bower of leaves and grass burned down, they said, “Where can our noble teacher have gone?” Now the farmer also had gone with the multitude, and standing among them, said, “It was I who burned down his bower of leaves and grass.” Then the multitude cried out, “Seize him; seize him. All because of this wicked man, we have lost the privilege of seeing the Private Buddha.” And they beat him with sticks and stones and deprived him of life. He was reborn in the Avīci Hell. After suffering torment in this Hell until the great earth was elevated a league, he came out thence; and because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted, he was reborn on Vulture Peak as a snake-ghost. End of Story of the snake-ghost.*";
P_HTM[1822]="***When the Teacher had related his misdeed in a former state of existence, he said,“Monks, as for an evil deed, it is like milk. Even as milk does not turn as soon as it is drawn, even so an evil deed does not at once ripen.

P_HTM[1829]="***For under the same circumstances as in the preceding story Elder Moggallāna the Great, while descending from Vulture Peak with Elder Lakkhaṇa, smiled on reaching a certain spot. When Elder Lakkhaṇa asked him why he smiled, he said, “Wait until we are in the presence of the Exalted One and then ask me.” When Moggallāna the Great had completed his alms-pilgrimage, he approached the Teacher, saluted him, and sat down respectfully on one side. Thereupon his companion asked him the same question again. Moggallāna replied as follows, “Brother, I saw a ghost three-quarters of a league in height. Sixty thousand sledge-hammers, blazing and burning, rose and fell uninterruptedly on top of his head. Again and again they broke his skull, and again and again his skull sprang up again. When I saw him I smiled, for I thought to myself, ‘In my present state of existence I never before saw such a being.’ ” In the Petavatthu occurs the following Stanza, together with many others, relating to this very ghost:*";
P_HTM[1830]="***Full sixty thousand sledge-hammers on all sides*";

P_HTM[1832]="***The Teacher listened to the Elder’s story and said, “Monks, I also saw that very creature as I sat on the Throne of Enlightenment. But out of compassion for others, I did not say, ‘As for those who will not believe my words, may it be to their disadvantage.’ Now, however, I will make Moggallāna my witness and tell what I saw.” When the monks heard this, they asked about the ghost’s misdeed in a previous state of existence. Thereupon the Teacher related the following*";
P_HTM[1833]="***13 a. Story of the Past: The stone-thrower and his pupil*";
P_HTM[1834]="***Once upon a time, the story goes, there lived in Benāres a cripple who was an adept at the art of slinging stones. He used to sit at the city-gate under a certain banyan-tree, sling stones, and cut the leaves of the tree. The boys of the city would say to him, “Make an elephant for us, make a horse for us;” and he would make every animal they asked him to. As a reward he received from them food both hard and soft. One day, as the king was on his way to the pleasure-garden, he came to this place. The boys left the cripple within the shoots of the banyan-tree and ran away. Now it was noon when the king stopped and went in among the roots of the tree, and his body was overspread with the chequered shade.*";
P_HTM[1835]="***“What does this mean?” said he, looking up. Seeing leaves cut in the forms of elephants and horses, he asked, “Whose work is this?” On being informed that it was the work of the cripple, he sent for him and said to him, “I have a house-priest who is excessively talkative. However little be said to him, he talks much and wearies me. Could you throw a pint-pot of goat’s dung into his mouth?” “I could, your majesty. Have goat’s dung brought, seat yourself behind a curtain with the house-priest, and I shall know just how to go to work.” The king did as the cripple suggested.*";
P_HTM[1836]="***The cripple made a hole in the curtain with the tip of a knife. While the house-priest talked with the king, whenever he opened his mouth, the cripple threw in a pellet of goat’s dung, and the house-priest swallowed every pellet thrown into his mouth. When the goat’s dung was exhausted, the cripple shook the curtain. The king, understanding by this sign that the goat’s dung was exhausted, said, “Teacher, while I am engaged in conversation with you, it is impossible for me to finish what I am saying. You talk so much that even in the act of swallowing a pint-pot of goat’s dung you cannot keep silent.” The Brahman immediately became silent. From that time on, he dared not open his mouth and talk with the king. The king remembered the skillful work of the cripple, caused him to be summoned, and said to him, “Through you I have gained happiness.” In token of his satisfaction, he gave him the Eightfold Gifts, and four fine large villages, north, east, south, and west of the city. Knowing this, a minister of the king who was his counselor in things temporal and spiritual pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1837]="***Capital skill indeed! but, good or bad,*";
P_HTM[1838]="***See, by a cripple’s throw, were won villages in the four quarters!*";
P_HTM[1839]="***Now the minister at that time was this very Exalted One.*";
P_HTM[1840]="***Now a certain man, observing the worldly prosperity won by the cripple, thought to himself, “This man, born a cripple, has won great prosperity through this art of his. I also ought to learn this art.” So he approached the cripple, bowed to him, and said to him, “Teacher, impart to me this art.” “Good friend, I cannot do so.” Although his request had been refused, he thought to himself, “Let be, I will win his favor.” Accordingly he bathed and rubbed the cripple’s hands and feet for a long time, and having thus won his favor, repeated his request. The cripple thought to himself, “This man has been exceedingly kind to me.” And unable to refuse his request, he taught him the art. Having so done, he said to him, “Good sir, your training is now complete; what will you do now?” “I shall go out into the world and display my art.” “What will you do?” “I will hit a cow or a man and kill him.” “Good sir, the penalty for killing a cow is a hundred pieces of money and for killing a man a thousand. Even with son and wife, you will not be able to pay. Do not commit murder. Look for something that has neither mother nor father and for hitting which there is no penalty.”*";
P_HTM[1841]="***“Very well,” said the man. So placing stones in a fold of his garment, he walked about looking for just that sort of target. First he saw a cow. “This animal has a consort,” thought he. Therefore he did not dare hit the cow. Then he saw a man. But he thought to himself, “This being has a mother and father.” Therefore he did not dare hit the man. Now at that time a Private Buddha named Sunetta resided in a bower of leaves and grass near the city. When the man saw him enter the city through the gate for the purpose of receiving alms, he thought to himself, “This man has neither mother nor father. If I hit him, I shall have no penalty to pay; I will try my skill by hitting him.” So aiming a stone at the right ear of the Private Buddha, he let fly. The stone entered the Private Buddha’s right ear and came out of his left ear. The Private Buddha suffered intense pain, was unable to continue his alms-pilgrimage, and returning to his bower of leaves through the air, passed into Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[1842]="***When the Private Buddha failed to come, the people thought, “Something must have gone wrong with him.” Accordingly they went to his hermitage, and when they saw that he had passed into Nibbāna, they wept and lamented. The man who hit the Private Buddha saw the multitude flock to his hermitage and went thither also. Recognizing the Private Buddha, he said, “It was he who met me face to face at the gate as he entered the city, and I hit him in trying my skill.” The multitude said, “This wicked fellow says that he hit the Private Buddha. Catch him! catch him!” And straightway they beat him and then and there deprived him of life. He was reborn in the Avīci Hell. Until this great earth was elevated a league, during all that time he suffered torment. Thereafter, because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted, he was reborn on the summit of Vulture Peak as a sledge-hammer ghost.*";
P_HTM[1843]="***The Teacher, after relating the story of his deed in a previous state of existence, said, “Monks, if a simpleton acquires art or power, it results to his disadvantage; for a simpleton who acquires art or power turns it to his own hurt.” And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[1851]="***Thus resolves the simpleton; so do his desire and pride increase.*";
P_HTM[1852]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Sudhamma. The story begins at Macchikāsaṇḍa and ends at Sāvatthi.*";
P_HTM[1853]="***For a householder named Citta, residing in the city of Macchikāsaṇḍa, observed the Elder Mahānāma, one of the Band of Five, making his round for alms; and pleased with his deportment, took his bowl, invited him into his house, provided him with food, and at the conclusion of the meal listened to the Law and obtained the Fruit of Conversion. Now Citta, possessed of immovable faith, desiring to make his own pleasure-garden Ambāṭaka Grove a place of residence for the Order, poured water into the right hand of the Elder and made the grove over to the Order. The moment he uttered the words, “The Religion of the Buddha is firmly established,” the great earth shook to its ocean boundary. The great treasurer caused a splendid monastery to be erected in the grove, and thereafter the door stood open to monks who came from all four quarters. At Macchikāsaṇḍa also resided the Elder Sudhamma.*";
P_HTM[1854]="***Some time afterwards, the two Chief Disciples, hearing the rumor of Citta’s good qualities, decided to pay their respects to him and therefore went to Macchikāsaṇḍa. Citta the householder, hearing that they were coming, proceeded forth half a league to meet them, escorted them to the monastery, invited them within, performed the usual duties for visitors, and then made the following request of the Captain of the Faith, “Reverend Sir, we desire to listen to a short discourse on the Law.” The Elder replied, “Lay disciple, we are weary with the journey; nevertheless listen for a short while.” Citta, merely by listening to the Elder’s discourse on the Law, obtained the Fruit of the Second Path. Then he bowed to the two Chief Disciples and invited them to be his guests, saying, “Reverend Sirs, pray take a meal in my house to-morrow with your thousand monks.” Then he turned to the resident monk, the Elder Sudhamma, and invited him, saying to him, “Reverend Sir, you also come to-morrow with the Elders.” Angry at the thought, “He invited me last,” Sudhamma refused the invitation; and although Citta repeated the invitation again and again, he still refused. The lay disciple said, “Pray be present, Reverend Sir,” and went out. On the following day he prepared splendid offerings in his own residence. Very early in the morning the Elder Sudhamma thought to himself, “What manner of food has the householder prepared for the Chief Disciples? I will go see.” So very early in the morning he took bowl and robe and went to his house.*";
P_HTM[1855]="***“Pray sit down, Reverend Sir,” said the householder. “I will not sit down,” replied Sudhamma; “I am about to set out on my round for alms.” The Elder surveyed the offerings prepared for the Chief Disciples, and seeking to annoy the householder about the varieties of food provided, said, “Householder, your food is most excellent, but there is one thing you have omitted.” “What is that, Reverend Sir?” “Sesame-cake, householder.” Thereupon the householder rebuked him, comparing him to a crow. Angered at this, the Elder said, “This is your residence, householder; I will depart.” Three times the householder strove to prevail upon the Elder to remain, but each time the latter refused. Finally he left the house, went to the Teacher, and related the words that had passed between Citta and himself. Said the Teacher, “You, an inferior, have insulted a faithful, believing disciple.” Having thus put the blame solely on the Elder, the Teacher sent him back to beg pardon of the disciple, saying, “Go beg pardon of Citta the householder.” The Elder went to Citta and said, “Householder, it was all my fault; pardon me.” But the householder refused to pardon him and said, “I will not pardon you.”*";
P_HTM[1856]="***Provoked at his failure to obtain pardon, he returned to the Teacher. The Teacher, although he knew that the householder would pardon Sudhamma, thought, “This Elder is stubborn in his pride; now let him go thirty leagues and come back.” And so, without telling him how he might gain pardon, he just dismissed him. The Elder returned with pride humbled. The Teacher then gave the Elder a companion and said to the Elder, “Go with this companion and ask pardon of the householder.” Said the Teacher, “A religious ought not to give way to pride or ill-will, thinking, ‘This dwelling is mine, this residence is mine, this male lay disciple is mine, this female lay disciple is mine.’ For if he so do, ill-will and pride and the other Depravities increase.” And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[1857]="***73. The simpleton will seek for false reputation, for precedence among the monks,*";
P_HTM[1858]="***For authority in the monasteries, for honors among other folk.*";

P_HTM[1861]="***Thus resolves the simpleton; so do his desire and pride increase.*";
P_HTM[1862]="***After listening to this admonition Elder Sudhamma bowed to the Teacher, rose from his seat, walked sunwise about the Teacher, and then, accompanied by his companion-monk, went within sight of the lay disciple, atoned for his fault, and begged the disciple’s pardon. The lay disciple both pardoned him and in turn asked his pardon, saying, “I pardon you, Reverend Sir; if I am to blame, pray pardon me also.” The Elder abode steadfast in the admonition given by the Teacher, and in but a few days attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[1863]="***The lay disciple thought to himself, “Even without seeing the Teacher I have attained the Fruit of Conversion; even without seeing him I have attained the Fruit of the Second Path. I ought to see the Teacher.” So he ordered yoked five hundred carts full of sesame, rice, ghee, sugar, garments, coverlets, and other offerings, and sent word to the Congregation of Monks, to the Congregation of Nuns, and to the lay disciples both male and female, “Let those who wish to see the Teacher come; they will lack nothing for offerings, whether of food or aught else.” With him went forth, of monks and nuns and lay disciples both male and female, five hundred each. That neither they nor his own retinue, three thousand souls in all, might lack broth or rice or aught else on the thirty-league journey, the householder Citta made ample provision. The deities, knowing that he had set out, posted themselves at intervals of a league along the way, and served that great multitude with rice-porridge, hard food, drink, and other necessities; there was no lack of aught for any. Proceeding at the rate of a league a day, waited upon in this manner by deities, the householder Citta and his retinue reached Sāvatthi in a month. There were five hundred carts filled as described above; and as the householder proceeded, deities and men brought presents, which he gave away.*";
P_HTM[1864]="***The Teacher addressed Elder Ānanda, “Ānanda, as the shadows of evening draw on, the householder Citta will arrive with five hundred carts and will pay obeisance to me.” “Reverend Sir, when he pays obeisance to you, will any miracle take place?” “Yes, Ānanda, a miracle will take place.” “What miracle, Reverend Sir?” “When he arrives and pays obeisance to me, a rain of celestial flowers will begin and will continue without interruption until a space eight karīsas in extent is covered with a glistening mass of flowers knee-deep.” Hearing rumor of this, the residents of the city said, “So great, they say, is the merit of the householder Citta who will to-day come and pay obeisance to the Teacher. Such, they say, is the miracle that will take place. We must without fail obtain the privilege of seeing this person of great merit.” So they took presents and stood on both sides of the way.*";
P_HTM[1865]="***As the procession approached the monastery, five hundred monks led the way. The householder Citta said to the eminent female lay disciples, “Reverend Sisters, you follow in the rear.” So saying, accompanied by five hundred male lay disciples, he went into the presence of the Teacher. (Now those that stand or sit in the presence of the Buddhas move not hither and thither, but stand on both sides immovable in the street of the Buddhas.) The householder Citta, a Noble Disciple who had attained the Three Fruits, entered the street trod by the Buddhas; whereupon every place he looked at trembled. “That must be the householder Citta,” said the multitude and gazed at him. The householder Citta, penetrating the six-colored rays of light of the Buddha, approached the Teacher, and grasping the Teacher’s feet by the two ankles, paid obeisance to him. At that very moment a rain of flowers fell precisely as the Teacher had predicted, and thousands of cries of applause went up.*";
P_HTM[1866]="***For one month the householder Citta abode with the Teacher. While he there abode, he provided seats for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha within the monastery and bestowed rich offerings upon them. He also housed and cared for within the monastery those that came with him. Not for a single day was it necessary for him to use what he had in his own carts; he performed all his duties of almsgiving solely with the presents brought by gods and men. Finally he paid obeisance to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, when I said to myself, ‘I will give alms to you,’ and set out on my journey, I was a month on the way. Here I have spent a month, and I find it impossible to present to you anything which I have myself brought. All this time have I presented to you alms solely of presents brought to me by gods and men. Even were I to remain here a year, I should not receive the privilege of bestowing alms of my own upon you. I desire to empty my carts and go; tell me where I can put away the offerings which I have brought.”*";
P_HTM[1867]="***Said the Teacher to Elder Ānanda, “Ānanda, empty some place for the lay disciple and assign it to him.” The Elder did so and is said to have assigned a suitable place to Citta the householder. Then the lay disciple, accompanied by the three thousand persons who had come with him, set out with empty carts on the return journey. Gods and men arose, saying, “Noble sir, your journey is made with empty carts;” and so saying, filled the carts with the seven kinds of jewels. As Citta the householder returned, he ministered to the needs of the multitude solely with the presents brought to himself.*";
P_HTM[1868]="***Elder Ānanda bowed to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, when Citta the householder came hither, he occupied a month traveling, spent just a month here, and all that time gave alms solely of presents brought him by gods and men. Now, having emptied five hundred carts, he will be an entire month going; but gods and men have arisen, saying, ‘Noble sir, your journey is made with empty carts,’ and so saying, have filled his carts with the seven kinds of jewels. On the return journey, they say, he will minister to the multitude solely with the presents which have thus been brought to him. Now, Reverend Sir, was it solely because he came to visit you, that he received all this honor? Or would he also have received it, had he gone elsewhere?” “Ānanda, he would have received it just the same, no matter whether he had come to visit me or had gone elsewhere. For this lay disciple is faithful and believing and virtuous. No matter what place such a man resorts to, there, wherever it is, he receives gain and honor.” So saying, the Teacher pronounced the following Stanza in the Pakiṇṇaka Vagga,*";
P_HTM[1869]="***303. If a man be faithful, endued with virtue, possessed of fame and wealth.*";
P_HTM[1870]="***No matter what place he resorts to, there, wherever it may be, he is honored.*";
P_HTM[1871]="***14 a. Story of the Past: Citta’s deed in a former birth*";
P_HTM[1872]="***When the Teacher had thus spoken. Elder Ānanda asked about Citta’s deed in a former birth. In reply the Teacher said, “Ānanda, Citta the householder made his Earnest Wish at the feet of the Exalted Padumuttara, and after passing through the round of existences among gods and men for a hundred thousand cycles of time, was reborn in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa as a hunter. One rainy day, after he had grown to be a man, he went to hunt in the forest with spear in hand. As he looked this way and that in search of quarry, he saw a certain monk seated in a natural cave with his upper robe drawn over his head. “This must be some noble monk who is seated engaged in meditation,” thought he; “I will bring him food.” So he went home quickly and caused flesh brought the day before to be cooked on one brazier, and rice on another. Then, seeing some monks going their rounds for alms, he took their bowls also, seated them on seats prepared for the purpose, procured food for them, and invited them in, saying, “Help yourselves, noble sirs.”*";
P_HTM[1873]="***Then he ordered additional food to be brought, placed it in a basket, and taking it with him, set out. On the way he plucked various kinds of flowers, placed them in a leaf-basket, and went on to the place where the Elder sat. “Reverend Sir,” said he, “bestow your favor upon me.” So saying, he took the Elder’s bowl, filled it, and placed it in his hand. Then honoring the Elder with those flowers, he made the following Earnest Wish, “Even as this portion of choice food, together with the gift of flowers, has pleased my heart, even so, in the various places where I shall be reborn, may my heart rejoice over the thousands of presents which I shall receive, and may rain of the five kinds of flowers rain upon my head.” During the term of life allotted to him he performed works of merit, and after his death he was reborn in the World of the Gods. In the place where he was reborn celestial flowers rained upon him knee-deep. In his present existence, both on the day of his birth and on the day when he came hither, a rain of flowers rained upon him and presents were offered to him and his carts were filled with the seven kinds of jewels. This was the result solely of his deed in a former birth.*";

P_HTM[1879]="***15 a. Story of the Past: The poor Brahman*";
P_HTM[1880]="***The incident with which this story begins, however, occurred at Rājagaha. Here, we are told, lived the Brahman Mahāsena, a friend of the Brahman Vaṅganta, who was the father of Sāriputta. One day, as the Elder Sāriputta went his rounds for alms, he took pity on Mahāsena and went to the door of his house. Now Mahāsena, who was poor and in need, thought to himself, “My son must have come to the door of my house for alms. But I am a poor man. Doubtless he does not know this. But I have no alms at all to give him.” Therefore, not daring to meet him face to face, he went and hid himself. On another day the Elder came again, and the Brahman hid himself as before. Said he to himself, “As soon as ever I get anything, I will give him something;” but it was some time before this happened.*";
P_HTM[1881]="***One day, at a certain Brahman recitation, he received a bowl of rice-porridge and a small piece of cloth, which he took home with him. Remembering the Elder, he said to himself, “This alms I ought to give to the Elder.” At that moment the Elder, who had been engaged in ecstatic meditation, rose from his trance, and seeing the Brahman, said to himself, “The Brahman has received alms and desires me to come to him; therefore I must go to him.” So putting on his mantle and taking his bowl, he went to the door of the Brahman’s house and showed himself standing there. When the Brahman saw the Elder, his heart was content. He approached him, paid obeisance to him, and gave him a friendly welcome; then, having provided him with a seat within his house, he took his own bowl of rice-porridge and placed the porridge in the Elder’s bowl. The Elder accepted half of the porridge and then covered his bowl.*";
P_HTM[1882]="***But the Brahman said to him, “Reverend Sir, here is but a single portion of rice-porridge; grant me happiness in the next life, not in this; I desire to give you all without reserve.” So saying, he poured all of the porridge into the Elder’s bowl. The Elder ate the porridge then and there. When he had finished his meal, the Brahman gave him the cloth, bowing and saying, “Reverend Sir, may I also obtain the same Truth you have seen.” “So be it, Brahman,” replied the Elder, returning thanks to him. Then, rising from his seat, he set out on his journey and in due course arrived at Jetavana. There is a saying, “Alms given in time of poverty rejoice the heart above measure;” and so it was with the Brahman. After he had made this offering his mind was at peace and his heart was filled with joy. And he conceived warm affection for the Elder.*";
P_HTM[1883]="***15 b. Story of the Present: The novice Tissa*";
P_HTM[1884]="***When he died, he was conceived, solely because of his affection for the Elder, in the womb of the wife of a supporter of the Elder living at Sāvatthi. As soon as the mother knew that a child was conceived in her womb she told her husband, and he saw to it that she received the treatment necessary for the protection of the embryo. Avoiding foods that were excessively hot or cold or sour, enfolding the child in her womb happily, the longing of pregnancy arose within her. “Oh,” she said, “that I might invite the five hundred monks led by the Elder Sāriputta to my house, provide seats for them, and offer them porridge of milk and rice unceasingly! Oh, that I myself might put on yellow robes, take my golden vessel, sit in the outer circle of the seats, and partake of the porridge left uneaten by so many monks!” (We are told that this longing of hers to put on yellow robes was a sign that her unborn child should one day become a monk under the dispensation of the Buddha.)*";
P_HTM[1885]="***“This is a pious longing which our daughter has expressed,” said her kinsfolk, and offered porridge of milk and rice unceasingly to the five hundred monks led by the Elder Sāriputta. She herself put on yellow robes, both under and upper garments, took her golden vessel, sat down in the outer circle of the seats, and partook of the porridge left by the monks; whereupon her longing subsided. On the expiration of ten lunar months she gave birth to a son. From time to time, both before her delivery and thereafter, she gave festivals at which she provided the five hundred monks led by Sāriputta with rich porridge of honey, milk, and rice. (This, it is said, was because the boy in his former existence as a Brahman gave rice-porridge.)*";
P_HTM[1886]="***Now at the festival held on the day of the child’s birth, they bathed the child very early in the morning, dressed him in beautiful garments, and laid him on a bed of royal splendor in a blanket worth a hundred thousand pieces of money. Even as he lay there, he looked at the Elder and said, “This is my former teacher, through whom I have attained this splendor. I ought to make an offering to him.” So when they carried him that he might receive the moral precepts, he wrapped that blanket about his little finger and lifted it up with him.*";
P_HTM[1887]="***His kinsfolk cried out, “His finger has caught in the blanket,” and sought to disengage it; whereupon he burst into tears. Then said they, “Leave the child alone; do not make him cry,” and carried him along, blanket and all. When it was time for him to make his bow to the Elder, he removed his finger from the blanket and cast the blanket at the Elder’s feet. His kinsfolk, instead of saying, “The young boy did this without knowing what he was doing,” said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, pray accept the offering the boy has presented to you; confer the moral precepts on your servant who has honored you with a blanket worth a hundred thousand pieces of money.”*";
P_HTM[1888]="***“What is the name of this boy?” “Reverend Sir, he is to be named after you.” “Tissa shall be his name.” Upatissa, as we know, was the name of the Elder in his younger days as a layman. His mother thought to herself, “I shall not interfere with the desire of my son.” Accordingly she presented the five hundred monks led by Sāriputta with rich porridge made of honey, milk, and rice, both at the festival of the naming of the child, and at the succeeding festivals of the partaking of food, the piercing of the ears, the reception of the cloth, and the conferring of tonsure.*";
P_HTM[1889]="***As the boy grew up and reached the age of seven years, he said to his mother, “Mother, I desire to become a monk under the Elder.” “Very well, my dear son; long ago I decided not to interfere with the inclination of my son; become a monk, my son.” So she invited the Elder to the house. When he arrived, she presented him with alms and said, “Reverend Sir, your servant says that he wishes to become a monk. I will come to the monastery this evening and bring him with me.” Having dismissed the Elder, she waited until evening, and then, taking her son with her and bearing rich gifts and offerings, she went to the monastery and committed him into the Elder’s hands.*";
P_HTM[1890]="***The Elder talked with him as follows, “Tissa, the life of a monk is a hard life; when he would like what is warm he gets what is cold, and when he would like what is cold he gets what is warm; those who become monks live a wearisome life, and you are delicate.” “Reverend Sir, I shall be able to do all that you enjoin upon me.” “Very well,” said the Elder. So he taught him the Formula of Meditation on the first five of the constituent parts of the body, by way of fixing in his mind the thought of the impurity of the body, and then made him a monk.*";
P_HTM[1891]="***(The entire Formula involves the recitation of all of the thirty-two constituent parts of the body, but those who are unable to recite all may recite the first five. The Formula in full is that invariably employed by all the Buddhas, but there is no limit to the number of monks and nuns and lay disciples both male and female who have attained Arahatship by meditating upon the hair and other parts singly. Inexperienced monks frequently make it impossible for their candidates to attain Arahatship. For this reason the Elder taught the boy only a part of the Formula before receiving him into the Order, and then established him in the ten moral precepts.)*";
P_HTM[1892]="***In honor of their son’s admission to the Order his mother and father remained at the monastery for seven days and presented the assembly presided over by the Buddha with naught but rich porridge made of honey, milk, and rice. The monks murmured thereat, saying, “We cannot always eat rich porridge made of honey, milk, and rice.” On the evening of the seventh day the boy’s mother and father went home, and on the eighth day the novice accompanied the monks to the city for alms.*";
P_HTM[1893]="***The residents of Sāvatthi said to each other, “They say that the novice will come to the city to-day for alms; we will therefore do him honor.” So with five hundred cloths they made cushions for alms-bowls, and taking five hundred bowls with portions of alms, they met the novice on the road and presented them to him. On the following day they went to the monastery park and repeated the offering. Thus in two days the novice received a thousand bowls of alms and a thousand cloths, all of which he presented to the assembly of monks. (This was the result of his presentation of the small piece of cloth to the Elder in his former existence as a Brahman.) So the monks gave him the name Tissa the Almsgiver, Piṇḍapātadāyaka Tissa.*";
P_HTM[1894]="***Again one day when it was cold, the novice, as he went the rounds of the monastery, noticed monks warming themselves here and there, both in rooms where fire was kept and in other places. Said he, “Reverend Sirs, why do you sit warming yourselves?” “Novice, we are cold.” “Reverend Sirs, when it is cold, one should wrap himself in a blanket; that will keep off the cold.” “Novice, you have acquired great merit and may be able to get a blanket, but where can we get any?” “Well then, Reverend Sirs,” said the novice, “let those who need blankets come with me,” and caused proclamation to be made to that effect throughout the monastery. Said the monks, “Let us go with the novice and procure blankets.” So all because of a novice seven years old, monks to the number of a thousand went forth. Not for a moment did he think, “Where can I get blankets for so many monks?” but just took them with him and started out for the city. (Such is the wonder-working power of alms generously bestowed.)*";
P_HTM[1895]="***Going from house to house without the city, he received five hundred blankets. And when he entered the city, men brought him blankets from all quarters. Now as a certain shop-keeper sat in his shop with five hundred blankets spread out before him, a certain man passed by the door and seeing him, said to him, “Sir, there is a certain novice coming this way collecting blankets; you had better hide yours.” “Is he taking them as gifts or otherwise?” “He receives them as gifts.” “That being the case, if I wish to, I will give him blankets; if not, I will not. Go on your way,” and with these words he dismissed him. (Thus do doting niggards begrudge people the gifts that others give them, even as did Kāla on beholding the incomparable gift of the king of Kosala; and therefore are they reborn in Hell.)*";
P_HTM[1896]="***The shop-keeper thought to himself, “This man who came along, in accordance with his nature, said to me, ’ You had better hide your blankets,’ and I replied to him, ‘In case the novice is receiving them as gifts, I will give him what is my own, if I wish; if not, I will not.’ Now a man feels ashamed not to give what is in plain sight, but cannot be blamed for hiding what is his own. And since among these five hundred blankets there are two each of which is worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, it will be entirely proper for me to hide them.” So he folded the two blankets border to border and hid them by inserting them in the pile.*";
P_HTM[1897]="***Just then the novice, accompanied by the thousand monks, came to that very place. When the shop-keeper saw the novice, he was filled with love for the boy; in fact his whole body was suffused with love. He thought to himself, “On seeing a boy like this, I should be willing to give my heart’s flesh, let alone blankets!” Straightway he removed those two blankets from the pile, placed them at the novice’s feet, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Reverend Sir, may I have a share in the Truth you have seen.” “So be it,” said the novice returning thanks to him. So the novice, who had received five hundred blankets without the city, received another five hundred within the city. Thus on one day alone he received a total of one thousand blankets, all of which he gave to the congregation of monks. Therefore the monks gave him the name Tissa the Blanket-Giver, Kambaladāyaka Tissa.*";
P_HTM[1898]="***(Thus his gift of a blanket to the Elder on the day he was given his name when he was seven years old resulted in his receiving one thousand blankets. In no dispensation other than that of the Buddha is the gift of a little productive of so much fruit, and a large gift productive of more abundant fruit. Therefore said the Exalted One, “Monks, this congregation of monks is of such sort that a little gift bestowed thereon produces much fruit, and a large gift yet more abundant fruit.” Thus, as the result of giving a single blanket, the novice, although he was only seven years old, received one thousand blankets.)*";
P_HTM[1899]="***While the novice was in residence at Jetavana, his boy-relatives came to see him frequently and talked and conversed with him. He thought to himself, “So long as I reside here, my boy-relatives will come to see me and will talk with me, and it will not be possible for me, whether they talk or not, to work out my own salvation; suppose I were to obtain a Formula of Meditation from the Teacher and go into the forest?” Accordingly he approached the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and obtained a Formula of Meditation leading to Arahatship. Then, paying obeisance to his preceptor, he took bowl and robe and departed from the monastery. “If I take up my residence in the neighborhood,” thought he, “my kinsmen will send for me.” Therefore he went a distance of twenty leagues.*";
P_HTM[1900]="***As he proceeded on his way he saw an old man at the gate of a certain village. The novice asked the old man, “Lay disciple, is there a forest hermitage in this neighborhood wherein monks may reside?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, there is.” “Well then, show me how to get there.” As soon as the old lay disciple saw the boy he took a liking to him. So instead of merely pointing out the way he remained standing where he was and said to him, “Come, Reverend Sir, I will show you the way.” So saying, the old man took him with him and started off. As the novice went with him he noticed along the way five or six places abounding in various kinds of flowers and fruits. The novice asked him the names of these places, and the lay disciple told him the name of each one.*";
P_HTM[1901]="***On reaching the forest hermitage the lay disciple said to him, “Here, Reverend Sir, is a pleasant place; take up your residence here.” Continuing, he asked the novice his name and then said to him, “Reverend Sir, be sure to come to our village for alms to-morrow.” Then turning back, he returned to his own village and proclaimed to the inhabitants, “Elder Tissa the Forest-dweller, Vanavāsika Tissa, has taken up his residence in the monastery; prepare broth, rice, and so forth for him.” So the novice, who at first bore the name Tissa, and after that the three names Piṇḍapātadāyaka Tissa, Kambaladāyaka Tissa, and Vanavāsī Tissa, received within seven years four names in all.*";
P_HTM[1902]="***Very early on the morning of the following day the novice entered that village for alms. When the people brought him alms and paid obeisance, he said, “May you be happy; may you obtain release from suffering.” One man even, on presenting alms to him, was unable to bring himself to return home. All, without exception, must needs stand and gaze at him. Thus he easily obtained sufficient food to support him. All the inhabitants of the village prostrated themselves on their breasts before his feet and said to him, “Reverend Sir, if you will reside here during these three months, we will receive the Three Refuges, abide steadfast in the five moral precepts, and perform the eight fast-day duties. Promise us to reside here.”*";
P_HTM[1903]="***Perceiving that assistance was to be had there, he gave them his promise and regularly went there only for alms. Whenever the villagers paid obeisance to him, he recited the couplet, “I wish you happiness and release from suffering,” and then went his way. After spending the first and the second month there, in the course of the third month he attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[1904]="***Now his preceptor Sāriputta, having kept residence during the rainy season and celebrated the terminal festival (pavāraṇā), approached the Teacher and having paid obeisance to him, said, “Reverend Sir, I am going to visit the novice Tissa.” “Go, Sāriputta,” said he. As Sāriputta set out with his own retinue of five hundred monks he said to Moggallāna, “Brother Moggallāna, I am going to see the novice Tissa.” Said the Elder Moggallāna, “I will go too, brother,” and set out with his retinue of five hundred monks. Likewise all the Chief Disciples, the Elder Mahā Kassapa, the Elder Anuruddha, the Elder Upāli, the Elder Puṇṇa, and the rest, set out each with his retinue of five hundred monks, the total retinue of all the Chief Disciples amounting to forty thousand monks.*";
P_HTM[1905]="***When they had gone a distance of twenty leagues, they came to the village which was the novice’s resort for alms. The novice’s regular personal attendant saw them, came to meet them at the village gate, and paid obeisance to them. The Elder Sāriputta asked him, “Lay disciple, is there a forest hermitage in this neighborhood?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, there is.” “Is there a monk residing there?” “There is, Reverend Sir.” “Has he monks with him, or has he none?” “He has, Reverend Sir.” “What is his name?” “The Elder Vanavāsī, Reverend Sir.” “Very well, show us the way there.” “Who are you, Reverend Sir?” “I have come to see my novice.”*";
P_HTM[1906]="***The lay disciple looked at them and recognized in them quite all the Chief Disciples, beginning with the Captain of the Faith. His whole body suffused with joy, he said, “Wait a moment, Reverend Sirs.” So saying, he quickly entered the village and proclaimed, “Here are the eighty noble Chief Disciples beginning with the Elder Sāriputta. They have come here, each with his own retinue of five hundred monks, to see the novice. Take beds, chairs, coverlets, lamps, and oil, and go out quickly.” The inhabitants straightway took beds and so forth as they were bidden, and falling in behind the Elders, entered the monastery with them. The novice recognized the congregation of monks, took the bowls and robes of a few of the Chief Elders and performed the customary duties for them.*";
P_HTM[1907]="***Even as he was arranging places for the Elders to reside and putting away their bowls and robes, the darkness of night came on. The Elder Sāriputta said to the lay disciples, “Retire, lay disciples, the darkness of night is come upon you.” They replied, “Reverend Sir, we expected to hear the Law to-day; we will not retire; we will hear the Law; we have not hitherto heard the Law.” “Well then, lay disciple, light the lamp and announce that it is time to hear the Law.” When he had done so the Elder said to him, “Tissa, your supporters say that they wish to hear the Law; preach the Law to them.” The lay disciples arose with one accord and said, “Reverend Sir, our revered novice knows no discourse on the Law except these two sentences, ‘May you be happy; may you obtain release from suffering.’ Let some one else preach the Law to us.” Then his preceptor said to him, “Novice, but how may one be happy? How may one obtain release from suffering? Tell us the meaning of these two sentences.”*";
P_HTM[1908]="***“Very well, Reverend Sir,” said he. So taking a variegated fan and mounting the Seat of the Law, he preached the Law to the pinnacle of Arahatship, even as a thunderstorm rains incessantly upon the four great continents, drawing the meaning and the matter from the five Nikāyas, and analyzing the attributes of being as set forth by the Buddha; namely, the Aggregates of Being, the Elements of Being, and the Organs and Objects of Sense. “Reverend Sirs,” said he, “thus does one who has become an Arahat obtain happiness, thus does one who has become an Arahat obtain release from suffering; other folk obtain not release from the suffering connected with birth and the rest, and from the pains of Hell and the rest.” “Well done, novice! you have interpreted the sacred texts well; now intone them.” Then the novice also intoned them.*";
P_HTM[1909]="***At sunrise the supporters of the novice were divided into two parties. Some were offended and said, “Indeed we have never seen anyone so crude. How is it that, able as he is to preach such a sermon on the Law, and having remained for so long a time as he has with his mother and father, he failed to recite a single Sentence of the Law to those present?” But others were pleased and said, “It is fortunate for us who know not even the difference between good and evil that we have ministered to one so saintly, and that we have just now been able to hear the Law from him.”*";
P_HTM[1910]="***He that is Supremely Enlightened surveyed the world early in the morning of that day. Observing that the supporters of the Elder Vanavāsī Tissa had entered the Net of his Knowledge, he considered within himself what would be the result. And he came to the following conclusion, “Some of the supporters of the Elder Vanavāsī Tissa are offended, while others are pleased. Those who are offended at a novice like my son will go to Hell. I must go to him, for if I go, all will be reconciled with my son and will obtain release from suffering.”*";
P_HTM[1911]="***The villagers, having invited the congregation of monks, went to the village, erected a pavilion, prepared broth, rice, and so forth, provided seats and sat down waiting for the congregation of monks to come. The monks, having attended to their bodily needs, entered the village at the customary time for going the rounds, and asked the novice, “Tissa, will you go with us, or will you wait until later?” “When it is time for me to go, I will go; you go on ahead, Reverend Sirs.” The monks took bowl and robe and went on. The Teacher put on his robe at Jetavana, took his bowl, went in the twinkling of an eye, and showed himself in front of the company of monks. There was one universal shout, “He that is Supremely Enlightened is come.” The whole village was agitated. With jubilant hearts men provided seats for the congregation of monks with the Buddha at their head and presented them with broth and hard food.*";
P_HTM[1912]="***Even before the meal was over, the novice entered the village. Thereupon the villagers brought food and presented it to him with due reverence. Taking as much as he required, he went to the Teacher and held out the bowl. “Bring it to me, Tissa,” said the Teacher. Extending his hand, he took the bowl and showed it to the Elder, saying, “See, Sāriputta, here is the bowl of your novice.” The Elder took the bowl from the Teacher’s hands and returned it to the novice, saying, “Go sit down where you are accustomed to sit down with your bowl and eat your meal.”*";
P_HTM[1913]="***The villagers, after waiting upon the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha, requested the Teacher to return thanks. In returning thanks he spoke as follows, “It is fortunate for you, lay disciples, that on account of the novice who has come to your homes you have been privileged to see Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Kassapa, and the rest of the eighty Chief Disciples. Indeed it was solely on account of this novice that I myself came here. It is fortunate for you that you have thus been privileged, solely on account of this novice, to behold the Buddha. It is your good fortune; yes, your very good fortune!”*";
P_HTM[1914]="***The villagers thought to themselves, “Indeed we were fortunate to be privileged to behold a novice who is able to win the favor of Buddhas and monks alike, and to give him alms.” So those who had been offended at the novice were pleased, while those who were satisfied were satisfied the more. At the conclusion of the words of thanksgiving many obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths. Then the Teacher arose from his seat and departed. The villagers accompanied him a little way and then turned back.*";
P_HTM[1915]="***As the Teacher walked side by side with the novice, he asked the novice the names of various places previously pointed out to him by the lay disciple, and the novice told him their names. When they reached the place where the novice resided, the Teacher climbed to the top of a mountain. From the top of this mountain the Great Ocean is visible. The Teacher asked the novice, “Tissa, as you stand on the top of the mountain and look this way and that, what do you see?” “The Great Ocean, Reverend Sir.” “What thought comes into your mind as you look upon the Great Ocean?” “Reverend Sir, this is the thought that comes into my mind, ‘At times when I have wept over my sufferings, I must have shed tears more abundant than the waters contained in the four oceans.’ ” “Well said, well said, Tissa! it is even so; in the times that you have suffered, you have indeed shed tears more abundant than the waters contained in the four great oceans.” So saying, the Teacher pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1916]="***But little water do the oceans four contain,*";
P_HTM[1917]="***Compared with all the tears that man hath shed.*";
P_HTM[1918]="***By sorrow stricken and by suffering distraught;*";
P_HTM[1919]="***Wherefore, O friend, still heedless dost remain?*";
P_HTM[1920]="***Again he asked him, “Tissa, where do you reside?” “In this mountain cave, Reverend Sir.” “What thought comes into your mind as you reside here?” “Reverend Sir, this is the thought that comes into my mind, ‘There is no limit to the number of times I have died and my body been laid upon this ground.’ ” “Well said, well said, Tissa! It is even so. There is no spot where these living beings we know have not lain down on the earth and died.” So saying, he recited the Upasāḷhaka Jātaka, found in the Second Book, as follows.*";
P_HTM[1921]="***Fourteen thousand Upasāḷhakas were burned in this place.*";
P_HTM[1922]="***There is no place where men have not died.*";
P_HTM[1923]="***Where truth is, and righteousness, where no injury is done to living beings,*";
P_HTM[1924]="***Where self-restraint and self-command exist.*";
P_HTM[1925]="***Thither resort holy men, there death is not.*";
P_HTM[1926]="***(While, as a general rule, it is true that of all beings who have died and whose bodies have been laid upon the earth, there are none who die where men have not died before, nevertheless men like the Elder Ānanda do die where men have not died before. For example, we are told that when the Elder Ānanda was a hundred and twenty years old, he surveyed his allotted term of life, and perceiving that the time of his dissolution was near at hand, made the announcement, “I shall die seven days hence.” This announcement was heard by dwellers on both sides of the river Rohiṇī. Thereupon those who dwelt on the near side said, “We have been of great service to the Elder; he will die on our side.” But those who dwelt on the far side said, “We have been of great service to the Elder; he will die on our side.” The Elder heard their remarks and thought to himself, “Those who dwell on both sides have helped me equally. I cannot say, ‘These men have not helped me.’ Now if I die on the near side, those who dwell on the far side will quarrel with their brethren over the question who are to have my relics. If, on the other hand, I die on the far side, those who dwell on the near side will do the same thing. Therefore, if a quarrel arises, it will arise solely because of me; and likewise if it ceases, it will cease solely because of me.” So he said, “Not only those who dwell on the near side are helpers of mine, but also those who dwell on the far side are helpers of mine. There are none who are not my helpers. Let those that dwell on the near side assemble on the near side, and let those that dwell on the far side assemble on the far side.”)*";
P_HTM[1927]="***(Seven days later, sitting cross-legged in the air over the middle of the river at the height of seven palm-trees, he preached the Law to the multitude. When he had finished his discourse, he commanded, “Let my body split in two; and let one portion fall on the near side and the other on the far side.” And sitting there, he entered into ecstatic meditation on the element of fire. Thereupon flames of fire burst from his body, his body split in two, and one portion fell on the near side and the other on the far side. The populace wept and wailed. Like the sound of the earth splitting open, was the sound of their lamentation; yet more pitiful even than that was the sound of lamentation at the death of the Teacher. For four months men went about wailing and lamenting, saying, “So long as he who held the Teacher’s bowl and robe remained, it was as if the Teacher himself yet remained among us. But now the Teacher is dead.”)*";
P_HTM[1928]="***Again the Teacher asked the novice, “Tissa, when you hear the noise of panthers and other wild beasts in this forest, are you afraid or not?” “I am not afraid, Exalted One. On the contrary, when I hear the noise of these animals, a feeling of love for the forest arises within me.” And he recited sixty Stanzas descriptive of the forest. Then said the Teacher to him, “Tissa!” “What is it, Reverend Sir?” “I am going. Will you go with me, or will you turn back?” “If my preceptor wishes to go and will take me with him, I will go; if he wishes to turn back, I will turn back, Reverend Sir.” The Teacher set out with the congregation of monks. Now it was the novice’s wish to turn back. The Elder knowing this, said to him, “Tissa, turn back if you wish to do so.” Accordingly the novice paid obeisance to the Teacher and the congregation of monks and turned back; the Teacher went back to Jetavana.*";
P_HTM[1929]="***A discussion arose in the Hall of Truth, “Truly it is a difficult task which the novice Tissa is performing! From the day he was reborn, his kinsfolk held seven festivals and provided five hundred monks with naught but rich porridge made of honey, milk, and rice. When he became a monk, they remained at the monastery for seven days and again provided the congregation of five hundred monks presided over by the Buddha with naught but rich porridge made of honey, milk, and rice. On the eighth day after he had become a monk he entered the village and in only two days received a thousand bowls of food and a thousand cushions for alms-bowls. Again another day he received a thousand blankets. So abundant were the gain and honor he received during his residence here. But he has now renounced all of this gain and honor, entered the forest, and is living on whatever food is brought him. It is truly a difficult task the novice Tissa is performing!”*";
P_HTM[1930]="***The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here now talking about?” They told him. “Yes, monks,” he replied, “there is one road which leads to gain, another which leads to Nibbāna. The doors of the four states of punishment stand open to the monk, who, thinking to acquire gain, takes upon himself the forest life and the other Pure Practices and clings to that which brings him gain. But he who walks upon the road that leads to Nibbāna, rejects the gain and honor he might have, enters the forest, and by struggling and striving wins Arahatship.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1931]="***75. For one road leads to gain, the other to Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[1932]="***Understanding this, the monk, the disciple of the Buddha,*";
P_HTM[1933]="***Should not delight in worldly gain, but should devote himself to solitude.*";

P_HTM[1938]="***It will be better, not worse, for one to follow so wise a man.*";
P_HTM[1939]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Venerable Rādha.*";
P_HTM[1940]="***We are told that before Rādha became a monk he was a poor Brahman living at Sāvatthi. Deciding to live with the monks, he went to the monastery and took up his residence there, performing various duties such as cutting the grass, sweeping the cells, and preparing water for bathing the face. The monks treated him kindly, but were not willing to admit him to the Order. The result of this was that he began to lose flesh.*";
P_HTM[1941]="***Now one day, early in the morning, the Teacher surveyed the world and seeing the Brahman, considered within himself what would become of him. Perceiving that he would become an Arahat, he went in the evening, feigning that he was making a tour of the monastery, to the Brahman’s quarters and said to him, “Brahman, what are you doing here?” “Performing the major and minor duties for the monks, Reverend Sir.” “Do they treat you kindly?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, I receive sufficient food, but they are not willing to admit me to the Order.” Accordingly the Teacher convoked an assembly of the monks and questioned them about the matter, saying, “Monks, is there anyone who remembers any act of this Brahman?”*";
P_HTM[1942]="***Said the Elder Sāriputta, “Reverend Sir, I remember something. When I was making my round in Rājagaha, he brought me a ladleful of his own food and gave it to me. I remember this good office of his.” Said the Teacher, “Sāriputta, is it not proper to release from suffering one who has performed such a service?” “Very well, Reverend Sir, I will receive him into the Order.” Sāriputta accordingly received him into the Order. He received a seat in the refectory in the outer circle of the seats. Even with rice-porridge and other kinds of food, he grew weary.*";
P_HTM[1943]="***The Elder took him with him on his rounds and constantly admonished and instructed him, saying, “You must do this; you must not do that.” The monk was amenable to discipline and respectful, and followed his preceptor’s instructions so faithfully that in but a few days he attained Arahatship. The Elder went with him to the Teacher, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down. The Teacher gave him a friendly welcome and said to him, “Sāriputta, is your pupil amenable to discipline?” “Yes, Reverend Sir, he is thoroughly amenable to discipline; no matter what fault I mention, he never shows resentment.” “Sāriputta, if you could have pupils like this monk, how many would you take?” “I would take all I could get, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[1944]="***Now one day the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “They say the Elder Sāriputta is grateful and thankful. When a poor Brahman gave him but a ladleful of food, he remembered his kindness and made a monk of him. Moreover the Elder Rādha, patient of admonition, received a patient teacher.” The Teacher, hearing their talk, said, “Monks, this is not the first time Sāriputta has shown himself grateful and thankful. He showed the same disposition in a previous state of existence also.” And to illustrate his meaning, he related the Alīnacitta Jātaka, found in the Second Book, as follows:*";
P_HTM[1945]="***Because of Alīnacitta, a mighty host was defeated;*";
P_HTM[1946]="***Alīnacitta captured alive the king of Kosala, dissatisfied with his army.*";
P_HTM[1947]="***Even so a monk alert of will, directed aright,*";
P_HTM[1948]="***By cultivating good qualities, by the attainment of Nibbāna,*";
P_HTM[1949]="***Will in due time bring about the destruction of all Attachments.*";
P_HTM[1950]="***Said the Teacher, “The Elder Sāriputta was at that time the solitary elephant which presented the pure white elephant his son to the carpenters, in recognition of the service they did him in healing his foot.” Having thus related the Jātaka about the Elder Sāriputta, he said with reference to the Elder Rādha, “Monks, when a fault is pointed out to a monk, he ought to be amenable to discipline like Rādha; and when he is admonished, he should not take offense. Indeed he who gives admonition should be looked upon as one who points out where treasures are to be found.” So saying, he joined the connection and, instructing them in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1951]="***76. Should one see, as it were, a revealer of hidden treasures, one who points out what should be avoided,*";
P_HTM[1952]="***Who administers reproof where there is occasion for reproof, a man of intelligence, one should follow so wise a man;*";

P_HTM[1957]="***These monks, we are told, were two pupils of the Chief Disciples, but in spite of that fact were shameless and wicked. While they were in residence at Kīṭāgiri with their retinues of five hundred monks, they planted and caused to be planted flowering trees and were guilty of all manner of misconduct besides. They violated homes and procured thence the monastic requisites on which they lived. They rendered that monastery uninhabitable for the amiable monks.*";
P_HTM[1958]="***Hearing of their doings, the Teacher determined to expel them from the Order. For this purpose he summoned the two Chief Disciples, together with their retinues, and said to them, “Expel those who will not obey your commands, but admonish and instruct those who will obey. He who admonishes and instructs is hated by those that lack wisdom, but is loved and cherished by the wise.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1959]="***77. Let a man admonish and instruct, and forbid what is improper;*";
P_HTM[1960]="***For if he do so, he will be loved by the good, but hated by the wicked.*";
P_HTM[1961]="***Sāriputta and Moggallāna went there and admonished and instructed those monks. Some of them received the admonitions of the Elders and corrected their behavior, others returned to the house-life, while still others were expelled from the Order.*";

P_HTM[1964]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Channa.*";
P_HTM[1965]="***The story goes that the Elder Channa once reviled the two Chief Disciples, saying, “Ever since I went forth with our Noble Master and made the Great Renunciation, I have looked at no one else; but now these two Elders go about saying, ‘I am Sāriputta, I am Moggallāna; we are the Chief Disciples.’ ” Learning from the monks what the Elder Channa was doing, the Teacher sent for him and admonished him. For a moment he was silent, but immediately afterwards went out and resumed his abuse of the Elders. The Teacher sent for him and admonished him the second time and again the third time, saying, “Channa, in the two Chief Disciples you have friends who are good men, the best of men; make friends of such good men and follow only such.” So saying, he preached the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[1966]="***78. One should not cultivate the friendship of evildoers; one should not cultivate fellows of the baser sort.*";
P_HTM[1967]="***Cultivate the friendship of men that are good, cultivate the best of men.*";
P_HTM[1968]="***But the Elder Channa, even after he had heard the Teacher’s admonition, went out and reviled and abused the Elders precisely as before. The monks reported the matter to the Teacher. The Teacher said, “Monks, so long as I remain alive, you will not be able to teach Channa. After my decease, however, you will succeed.” When the Great Decease was at hand, the Venerable Ānanda asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, how shall we deal with the Elder Channa?” Then the Teacher directed Ānanda to inflict upon Channa the punishment known as “brahmadaṇḍa.” After the decease of the Teacher Channa was summoned. Ānanda pronounced sentence. Hearing the sentence, Channa was overwhelmed with sorrow and sadness at the thought of having fallen after being freed three times. He cried out, “Do not ruin me, Reverend Sir,” and thereafter performed his duties faithfully, in no long time becoming an Arahat endowed with the Supernatural Faculties.*";

P_HTM[1971]="***The wise man ever delights in the Law as taught by holy men.*";
P_HTM[1972]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Kappina the Great. The story from beginning to end is as follows:*";
P_HTM[1973]="***4 a. Story of the Past: Weavers and householders*";
P_HTM[1974]="***In times past, they say, Venerable Kappina the Great made his Earnest Wish at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara, and after passing through successive births and rebirths was at length reborn as the senior weaver in a certain weavers’ village not far from Benāres. At this time a thousand Private Buddhas, who had resided eight months in the Himālaya, were spending the four months of the rainy season in the country; and on a certain occasion they came down into the vicinity of Benāres and sent eight Private Buddhas to the king, asking to be given work in return for lodging.*";
P_HTM[1975]="***Now just at this time the king was occupied with preparations for the plowing festival. When he heard that Private Buddhas had arrived, he came out and inquired their errand. Then he said to them, “Reverend Sirs, I have no time to-day to attend to your needs, for on the morrow we are to celebrate the plowing festival. But if you will come back again on the third day, I will do as you ask.” And without so much as inviting them to a meal, he turned and reëntered his palace. The Private Buddhas remarked, “We will go to some other village,” and departed.*";
P_HTM[1976]="***Just then the wife of the senior weaver, who was on her way to Benāres on some errand or other, saw the Private Buddhas, and saluting them, asked, “Reverend Sirs, how is it that you have come here at such an unsuitable time?” When she had learned all the facts, this woman, richly endowed with faith and intelligence, invited them to a meal, saying, “Reverend Sirs, take your meal with us to-morrow.” “But there are a great many of us, sister.” “How many are there of you, Reverend Sirs?” “A thousand.” “Reverend Sirs, there are just a thousand artisans in this village; each will give food to one guest; pray accept food from us; I will see to it that you are provided with quarters.”*";
P_HTM[1977]="***The Private Buddhas accepted the invitation, and the woman entered the village and made proclamation, “I saw a thousand Private Buddhas and invited them to a meal; arrange seats for these noble persons and likewise prepare broth, rice, and so forth.” She then had a pavilion erected in the center of the village, caused seats to be arranged, and on the following day provided the Private Buddhas with seats and served them with choice food. At the end of the meal, accompanied by all the women in that village, she saluted the Private Buddhas and said, “Reverend Sirs, promise us to remain here during these three months.”*";
P_HTM[1978]="***Having obtained their promise, she returned to the village and made proclamation once more, “Men and women, let one man from each household among you go to the forest with axes and hatchets, fetch hither building materials, and erect quarters for our honored guests.” The villagers obeyed her injunction and built a thousand huts of leaves and grass with night-quarters and day-quarters, each man building one hut. And when the Private Buddhas entered upon residence in their respective huts, the villagers offered to minister faithfully to their needs, and faithfully did they minister to them. At the conclusion of the rainy season the woman persuaded each villager to prepare a set of robes for the particular Private Buddha who had passed the rainy season in his hut, and saw to it that each of her guests was provided with a set of robes worth a thousand pieces of money. At the conclusion of their residence the Private Buddhas returned thanks and departed.*";
P_HTM[1979]="***Having performed this work of merit, the villagers passed from that state of existence and were reborn as a troop of deities in the World of the Thirty-three. After enjoying celestial glory in that state of existence, they were reborn in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa as householders of Benāres. The senior weaver was the son of the senior householder, and the wife of the senior weaver was the daughter of the senior householder. All of those women also, on reaching marriageable age, married their former husbands.*";
P_HTM[1980]="***Now one day those householders heard the announcement that the Teacher was to preach the Law at the monastery; therefore all of them, accompanied by their wives, went to the monastery to hear the Law. Scarcely had they entered the inclosure of the monastery when it began to rain. Persons who had intimate friends or kinsmen among the novices or monks found shelter in their cells; but the company of householders, having no friends or relatives at the monastery, were unable to gain entrance and were obliged to remain unprotected in the monastery inclosure.*";
P_HTM[1981]="***The senior householder said to them, “See what a plight we are in; respectable persons ought to be ashamed to be in such a plight.” “But, sir, what are we to do?” “We have fallen into this plight because we are not on terms of intimacy with the monks; let us contribute money and build a monastery.” “Very well, sir.” The senior householder gave a thousand pieces of money, the other householders five hundred apiece, and each of the women two hundred and fifty. Having collected the money, they began the erection of what is called a Great Monastery, crowned with a thousand pinnacles, to serve as a place of residence for the Teacher; and when, by reason of the great extent of the work they had undertaken, the money proved to be insufficient, each of those who had contributed before gave half as much again. When the monastery was completed, they held a festival in honor of the opening of the monastery and for seven days gave rich gifts to the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha, presenting each of the twenty thousand monks with a set of robes.*";
P_HTM[1982]="***But the wife of the senior householder, although she had already done the same as the rest had done, determined in her wisdom to do yet more. Said she, “I will do honor to the Teacher.” Accordingly she took a garment of the color of anoja flowers, worth a thousand pieces of money, and a casket of anoja flowers, and when it was time for the Teacher to return thanks, she honored him with a present of the anoja flowers; and then casting the garment at his feet, made this Earnest Wish, “Reverend Sir, in my future states of existence may my body be of the hue of the anoja flower and may my name be ‘Anojā.’ ” “So be it,” replied the Teacher, returning thanks. Having lived out their allotted term of life, all of them passed from that state of existence and were reborn in the World of the Gods.*";
P_HTM[1983]="***4 b. Story of the Present: King Kappina and Queen Anojā*";
P_HTM[1984]="***Passing from the World of the Gods, the senior householder was reborn in the royal household of the city Kukkuṭavatī. King Kappina the Great was his name. The rest of the company were reborn in the households of courtiers. The wife of the senior householder was reborn in the royal household of the kingdom of Maddā in the city of Sāgala. Her body was of the hue of the anoja flower, and “Anojā” was the name they gave her. When she reached marriageable age she was married to King Kappina and became known as Queen Anojā. The rest of the women were reborn in the households of courtiers, and when they reached marriageable age were married to the sons of those same courtiers.*";
P_HTM[1985]="***All of them enjoyed glory like the glory of the king. Whenever the king rode in procession, mounted on his elephant and adorned with all his adornments, they also rode in procession in like state; whenever the king went about on his horse or in his chariot, they also went about in like manner. Thus it was that since as one company they had performed works of merit, as one company also they enjoyed equal glory.*";
P_HTM[1986]="***Now the king had five horses, Vāla, Puppha, Vāḷavāhana, Pupphavāhana, and Supatta. One of these horses, Supatta, he alone rode; the other four he allowed riders to use for carrying messages. Early one morning after breakfast he sent out the four riders with this command, “Ride forth and scour the country for two or three leagues about and if you learn of the appearance of the Buddha or the Law or the Order, come back and bring me the good news.” The riders rode forth from the four gates and scoured the country for two or three leagues about, but returned with no news.*";
P_HTM[1987]="***One day the king mounted his horse and accompanied by a retinue of courtiers, proceeded to his pleasure-garden. Seeing five hundred weary-looking traders entering the city, he said, “These men are weary from a journey; perhaps we shall hear some good news from them.” So he summoned them and asked them, “Whence do you come?” “Your majesty, there is a city called Sāvatthi a hundred and twenty leagues from here; thence do we come.” “Is there any news from your country?” “None other than this, your majesty, that the Supremely Enlightened One, the Buddha, has appeared.”*";
P_HTM[1988]="***Straightway the king’s whole body was thrilled with the five sorts of joy; for a moment he hesitated, for he was unable to collect his thoughts; then he said, “Friends, what is it that you say?” “The Buddha has appeared, your majesty.” Twice and thrice did the king hesitate and speak as before. And again a fourth time he said, “Friends, what is it that you say?” “The Buddha has appeared, your majesty.” “Friends, I give you a hundred thousand pieces of money; is there any other news besides?” “Yes, your majesty, there is; the Law has appeared.”*";
P_HTM[1989]="***When he heard this also, the king hesitated and spoke three times as before, and when for the fourth time he heard the word “Law,” he said, “Here, I give you a hundred thousand pieces of money.” Then he asked them, “Friends, is there any other news besides?” “Yes, your majesty, there is; the Order has appeared.” When the king heard this also, he hesitated and spoke three times as before, and when for the fourth time he heard the word “Order,” he said, “Here, once more do I give you a hundred thousand pieces of money.”*";
P_HTM[1990]="***Having so done, he surveyed his thousand courtiers and asked them, “Friends, what is your pleasure?” “Your majesty, what is your pleasure?” “Friends, I have heard the good news, ‘The Buddha has appeared, the Law has appeared, the Order has appeared;’ therefore I shall not return to my palace again, but for the sake of the Teacher I shall go and become a monk under him.” “Your majesty, we too will become monks with you.”*";
P_HTM[1991]="***The king caused a message to be written on a plate of gold and said to the merchants, “Queen Anojā will give you three hundred thousand pieces of money so soon as you give her this message, ‘The King’s dominion is given into your hands; enjoy the glory thereof at your good pleasure.’ ” And he added, “Should she ask you, however, where the King is, tell her that for the sake of the Teacher he has departed to become a monk under him.” The king’s courtiers also sent similar messages to their wives. And as soon as the king had dismissed the traders, he departed with his retinue of a thousand courtiers.*";
P_HTM[1992]="***Early in the morning of that day the Teacher surveyed the world, and seeing King Kappina the Great with his retinue, became aware of the following, “Yonder Kappina the Great has heard from the traders of the appearance of the Three Jewels, has rewarded them with three hundred thousand pieces of money for bringing him word, has renounced his kingdom, and purposes on the morrow, accompanied by his retinue of a thousand courtiers, to retire from the world for my sake and become a monk; he and his retinue will attain Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties; it behooves me to go to meet him.” Accordingly on the following day, like a Universal Monarch going forth to meet the headman of a little village, he took bowl and robe and went forth, and having traveled two hundred leagues he sat down on the bank of the river Candabhāgā under a banyan-tree, and there he remained, diffusing rays of six colors.*";
P_HTM[1993]="***As the king proceeded on his way he came to a certain river. “What river is this?” he asked. “The river Aravacchā, your majesty.” “How deep is it and how wide is it, friends?” “It is one league deep and two leagues wide, your majesty.” “Is there a boat here, or a raft?” “There is not, your majesty.” “While we are looking for boats and rafts, birth is bringing us to old age and old age is bringing us to death. Free from doubt, I have renounced the world for the sake of the Three Jewels; by their supernatural power may this water be to me unlike water.” Having thus considered the virtues of the Three Jewels, the king meditated upon the Buddha, saying, “He is the Exalted One, the Holy One, the Supremely Enlightened, Endowed with Knowledge and Righteousness.” While thus engaged in meditation the king and his retinue dashed over the surface of the river on their thousand horses, the Sindh horses springing upon the surface of the river as on a flat rock, without so much as wetting the tips of their hoofs.*";
P_HTM[1994]="***Having crossed the river Aravacchā, the king proceeded until he came to yet another river. “What is the name of this river?” he asked. “The river Nīlavāhanā, your majesty.” “How deep is it and how wide is it?” “Half a league deep and half a league wide, your majesty.” The rest exactly as before, except that when the king saw this river he said, “Well has the Law been preached by the Exalted One,” and crossed by meditating on the Law. Having crossed the river Nīlavāhanā, the king proceeded until he came to yet a third river. “What is the name of this river?” he asked. “The river Candabhāgā, your majesty.” “How deep is it and how wide is it?” “A league deep and a league wide, your majesty.” The rest exactly as before, except that when the king saw this river he said, “Devoted to righteousness is the Order of Disciples of the Exalted One,” and crossed by meditating on the Order.*";
P_HTM[1995]="***After crossing the third river as the king continued his journey, he saw the rays of light of six colors which issued from the body of the Teacher; the branches and forks and leaves of the banyan-tree appeared as though made of pure gold. The king thought to himself, “This radiance is not that of the moon or sun, nor yet that of any mighty Nāga or Garuḍa; it must be that, setting out as I have for the sake of the Teacher, I have been seen by the great Gotama Buddha.” Accordingly he dismounted at once from his horse and inclining his body to the direction of the rays, approached the Teacher; and penetrating the circle of the Buddha’s rays as one might plunge into a sea of vermilion, he paid obeisance to the Teacher and with his retinue of a thousand courtiers seated himself respectfully on one side.*";
P_HTM[1996]="***The Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequence, and at the conclusion of his discourse the king and his company of courtiers were established in the Fruit of Conversion, whereupon all of them arose with one accord and requested to be admitted to the Order. The Teacher considered within himself, “Will these noblemen receive bowls and robes created by magic?” and became aware of the following, “These noblemen gave a thousand robes to a thousand Private Buddhas, and in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa also gave twenty thousand robes to twenty thousand monks; it is not wonderful that they should receive bowls and robes created by magic.” Therefore he extended his right hand and said, “Come, monks, take up the religious life, that you may utterly extinguish suffering.” Straightway they were provided with the eight monastic requisites, becoming as it were Elders a century old, and first soaring into the air, they returned to earth, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down.*";
P_HTM[1997]="***The traders went to the royal palace, announced that they had been sent by the king, and upon being invited to enter by the queen, entered, made obeisance, and stood respectfully on one side. The queen asked them, “Sirs, on what errand have you come?” “Your majesty, we were sent to you by the king, who gave us three hundred thousand pieces of money.” “Sirs, it is a large sum of money you mention; what did you do for the king that pleased him so greatly that he gave you that amount of money?” “Nothing much, your majesty; all we did was to bring the king a certain piece of news.” “Are you permitted to tell me also what it was?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Well then, sirs, tell me.” “Your majesty, ‘The Buddha has appeared in the world.’ ”*";
P_HTM[1998]="***When the queen heard this, she was affected precisely as the king had been; her body was suffused with joy, and three times she failed to grasp the meaning of what she heard. When she heard the word “Buddha” the fourth time, she inquired, “What did the king give you when he heard this word?” “A hundred thousand pieces of money, your majesty.” “Sirs, the king did not reward you suitably when he gave you only a hundred thousand pieces of money for bringing him such a message; it is a poor present I give you in presenting you with three hundred thousand pieces of money. Did you bring the king any other message?” “Such and such,” said they, repeating the two other messages. As before, the queen’s body was suffused with joy at each of the messages she heard; three times she failed to grasp the meaning of what she heard, but the fourth time she heard each message she presented them with three hundred thousand pieces of money. Thus in all they received twelve hundred thousand pieces of money.*";
P_HTM[1999]="***Then the queen asked them, “Sirs, where is the king?” “Your majesty, he has departed, saying, ‘For the sake of the Teacher I will become a monk.’ ” “Did he send me any message?” “All his kingly power is given into your hands; enjoy the glory thereof at your own good pleasure.” “And where are his courtiers, sirs?” “Your majesty, they also went away, saying, ‘We will become monks with the king.’ ” Thereupon the queen summoned the wives of the courtiers and said to them, “Friends, your husbands have departed, saying, ‘We will become monks with the king;’ what will you do?” “But what message did they send to us, your majesty?” “They have given the glory they possess into your hands to enjoy according to your own good pleasure.” “But, your majesty, what do you intend to do?”*";
P_HTM[2000]="***“Friends, he who but now was king made ready for the journey, and having honored the Three Jewels with three hundred thousand pieces of money and having cast off his glory as he would eject a mass of saliva, departed to become a monk. I also have learned of the appearance of the Three Jewels and have honored the Three Jewels with hundreds of thousands more. The glory which spells suffering to the king spells suffering to me also. Who would get down on his knees and take into his mouth a mass of saliva ejected by the king? I have no need of real glory; I also will go forth for the sake of the Teacher and become a nun.” “Your majesty, then we also will become nuns with you.” “Well and good, friends, if you are able.” “We are able, your majesty.”*";
P_HTM[2001]="***“Well then, come,” said the queen. So she caused a thousand chariots to be harnessed, mounted her chariot and departed, accompanied by her retinue. Coming to the first river on the journey, she asked the same questions the king had asked and received the same answers, whereupon she said to her companions, “Look for the way taken by the king.” They replied, “Your majesty, we see no footprints of Sindh horses.” Said the queen, “The king must have pronounced an Act of Truth, saying, ‘For the sake of the Three Jewels I have renounced the world and so crossed. I also have renounced the world for the sake of the Three Jewels; by their supernatural power may this water be to me unlike water.” And meditating thus on the power of the Three Jewels, she ordered her thousand chariots to go forward. The water was like a flat rock, insomuch that not even the outer rims of the wheels were wetted. In like manner also she crossed the remaining two rivers.*";
P_HTM[2002]="***When the Teacher became aware of her approach, he rendered the monks invisible that they might not be seen sitting with him. As she drew nearer and nearer and saw the rays of light issuing from the body of the Teacher, the same thought came to her as had previously come to the king. Having approached the Teacher, she paid obeisance to him, stood respectfully on one side, and asked him, “Reverend Sir, methinks Kappina the Great has come to you and told you that he has renounced the world for your sake. Where is he? Show him to us.” “Just sit down; you will presently see him even here.” The hearts of all those women were filled with joy at the thought that while seated even there they should see their husbands. So they sat down.*";
P_HTM[2003]="***The Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequence. At the conclusion of his discourse the queen and her retinue were established in the Fruit of Conversion. The Elder Kappina the Great and his retinue, who heard the Teacher preach the Law to the women, attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties. At that moment the Teacher showed the monks to the women. We are told that the reason why the Teacher did not show the monks to the women at the very moment when they arrived, was for fear that should they see their husbands with yellow robes and shaven heads, their minds would be disturbed and they would therefore be unable to attain the Path and the Fruits. Hence it was that he waited until the women were firmly grounded in faith to show them the monks in their state as Arahats.*";
P_HTM[2004]="***When the women saw the monks, they paid obeisance to them with the Five Rests, and said, “Reverend Sirs, now have you reached the goal of your religious life.” Having so said, they paid obeisance to the Teacher, stood respectfully on one side, and requested to be admitted to the Order. We are told that when they made this request, some of the monks said, “The Teacher thought of the coming of Uppalavaṇṇā.” But the Teacher said to those female lay disciples, “Go to Sāvatthi and enter the religious life in the Convent of Nuns.” So those female lay disciples started out on foot and journeyed from place to place, the populace everywhere offering them hospitality and bestowing honor upon them, and after a journey of a hundred and twenty leagues they reached the Convent of Nuns, were admitted to the Order, and attained Arahatship. The Teacher taking the thousand monks with him, flew through the air to Jetavana.*";
P_HTM[2005]="***At Jetavana Venerable Kappina the Great went about the night-quarters and the day-quarters breathing forth the solemn utterance, “Oh happiness! oh happiness!” The monks reported the matter to the Exalted One, saying, “Reverend Sir, Venerable Kappina the Great is going about saying, ‘Oh happiness! oh happiness!’ Presumably he is talking about the happiness of his own rule as king.” The Teacher sent for him and said to him, “Kappina, is it true, as they say, that you are breathing forth utterances regarding the happiness of love and the happiness of rule?” “Reverend Sir, the Exalted One himself knows whether or not I am breathing forth utterances regarding happiness of that kind.”*";
P_HTM[2006]="***The Teacher said to the monks, “Monks, it is not with reference to the happiness of ruling that my son is breathing forth solemn utterances. He that drinks the Law delights in the Law. It is with reference to Nibbāna the Deathless that he is breathing forth these solemn utterances of joy.” And having so spoken, the Teacher joined the connection and instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2007]="***79. He that drinks the Law sleeps happily, with mind serene;*";
P_HTM[2008]="***The wise man ever delights in the Law as taught by holy men.*";
P_HTM[2009]="*[64] 5. Paṇḍitasāmaṇeravatthu**5. Paṇḍita The Novice*";
P_HTM[2010]="***80. Ditch-diggers lead the water, arrow-makers straighten their shafts,*";
P_HTM[2011]="***Carpenters straighten the wood; wise men control themselves.*";
P_HTM[2012]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the novice Paṇḍita.*";
P_HTM[2013]="***5 a. Story of the Past: Sakka and the poor man*";
P_HTM[2014]="***In times past, they say, Kassapa the Supremely Enlightened, accompanied by a retinue of twenty thousand monks freed from the Depravities, paid a visit to Benāres. Thereupon the residents, mindful of the fame they should acquire thereby, united in bands of eight or ten and presented the visiting monks with the customary offerings. Now it happened one day that the Teacher, in returning thanks at the end of the meal, spoke as follows:*";
P_HTM[2015]="***“Lay disciples, here in this world one man says to himself, ‘It is my bounden duty to give only that which is my own. Why should I urge others to give?’ So he himself gives alms, but does not urge others to give. That man, in his future states of existence receives the blessing of wealth, but not the blessing of a retinue. Another man urges others to give, but does not himself give. That man receives in his future states of existence the blessing of a retinue, but not the blessing of wealth. Another man neither himself gives nor urges others to give. That man in his future states of existence receives neither the blessing of wealth nor the blessing of a retinue, but lives as an eater of remnants. Yet another man not only himself gives, but also urges others to give. That man, in his future states of existence, receives both the blessing of wealth and the blessing of a retinue.”*";
P_HTM[2016]="***Now a certain wise man who stood near heard this and thought to himself, “I will straightway so act as to obtain both blessings for myself.” Accordingly he paid obeisance to the Teacher and said, “Reverend Sir, to-morrow receive alms from me.” “How many monks do you wish me to bring?” “How many monks are there in your retinue, Reverend Sir?” “Twenty thousand monks.” “Reverend Sir, to-morrow bring all your monks and receive alms from me.” The Teacher accepted his invitation.*";
P_HTM[2017]="***The man entered the village and announced, “Men and women, I have invited the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha to take a meal here to-morrow; each and all of you give to as many monks as you are able.” Then he went about inquiring how many each could provide for. “We will supply ten,” “We will supply twenty,” “We will supply a hundred,” “We will supply five hundred,” they replied, each giving in proportion to his means. All of the pledges he wrote down in order on a leaf.*";
P_HTM[2018]="***Now at that time there lived in this city a certain man who was so poor that he was known as Prince of Paupers, Mahāduggata. The solicitor meeting him face to face, said also to him, “Sir Mahāduggata, I have invited the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha for to-morrow; to-morrow the residents of the city will give alms; how many monks will you provide for?” “Sir, what have I to do with monks? Monks need rich men to provide for them. But as for me, I possess not so much as a small measure of rice wherewith to make porridge to-morrow; what have I to do with monks?”*";
P_HTM[2019]="***Now it behooves a man who urges others to give to be circumspect; therefore when the solicitor heard the poor man plead his poverty as an excuse, instead of remaining silent, he spoke to him as follows, “Sir Mahāduggata, there are many people in this city who live in luxury, eating rich food, wearing soft clothes, adorned with all manner of adornments, and sleeping on beds of royal splendor. But as for you, you work for your living and yet get scarcely enough to fill your belly. That being the case, does it not seem to you likely that the reason why you yourself get nothing is that you have never done anything for others?” “I think so, sir.” “Well, why do you not do a work of merit right now? You are young, you have plenty of strength; is it not your bounden duty while you are earning a living to give alms according to your ability?” Even as the solicitor spoke, the poor man was overcome with emotion and said, “Write my name on the leaf for one monk; no matter how little I may earn, I will provide food for one monk.” The solicitor said to himself, “What is the use of writing one monk on the leaf?” and omitted to write down the name.*";
P_HTM[2020]="***Mahāduggata went home and said to his wife, “Wife, to-morrow the residents of the village will provide food for the congregation of monks. I also was requested by the solicitor to provide food for one monk; therefore we also will provide food for one monk to-morrow.” His wife, instead of saying to him, “We are poor; why did you promise to do so?” said, “Husband, what you did was quite right; we are poor now because we have never given anything; we will both work for hire and give food to one monk.” So both of them went out to look for work.*";
P_HTM[2021]="***A rich merchant saw Mahāduggata and said to him, “Sir Mahāduggata, do you wish to work for hire?” “Yes, your honor.” “What kind of work can you do?” “Whatever you would like to have done.” “Well then, we are going to entertain three hundred monks; come, split wood,” and he brought an axe and a hatchet and gave them to him. Mahāduggata put on a stout girdle and exerting himself to the utmost, began to split wood, first tossing the axe aside and taking the hatchet, and then tossing the hatchet aside and taking the axe. The merchant said to him, “Sir, to-day you work with unusual energy; what is the reason for it?” “Master, I expect to provide food for one monk.” The merchant was pleased at heart and thought to himself, “It is a difficult task this man has undertaken; instead of remaining silent and refusing to give because of his poverty, he says, ‘I will work for hire and provide food for one monk.’ ”*";
P_HTM[2022]="***The merchant’s wife also saw the poor man’s wife and said to her, “Woman, what kind of work can you do?” “Whatever you wish to have done.” So she took her into the room where the mortar was kept, gave her a winnowing-fan, a pestle, and so on, and set her at work. The woman pounded the rice and sifted it with as much joy and pleasure as if she were dancing. The merchant’s wife said to her, “Woman, you appear to take unusual joy and pleasure in doing your work; what is the reason for it?” “Lady, with the wages we earn at this work we expect to provide food for one monk.” When the merchant’s wife heard this she was pleased and said to herself, “What a difficult task it is that this woman is doing!”*";
P_HTM[2023]="***When Mahāduggata had finished splitting the wood, the merchant gave him four measures of rice as pay for his work and four more as an expression of good will. The poor man went home and said to his wife, “The rice I have received for my work will serve as a supply of provisions for us. With the pay you have earned procure curds, oil, wood, relishes, and utensils.” The merchant’s wife gave the woman a cup of ghee, a vessel of curds, an assortment of relishes, and a measure of clean rice. The husband and wife between them therefore received five measures of rice.*";
P_HTM[2024]="***Filled with joy and satisfaction at the thought that they had received food to bestow in alms, they rose very early in the morning. Mahāduggata’s wife said to him, “Husband, go seek leaves for curry and fetch them home.” Seeing no leaves in the shop, he went to the bank of the river. And there he went about picking up leaves, singing for joy at the thought, “To-day I shall have the privilege of giving food to the noble monks.”*";
P_HTM[2025]="***A fisherman who had just thrown his big net into the water and was standing close by thought to himself, “That must be the voice of Mahāduggata.” So he called him and asked, “You sing as though you were overjoyed at heart; what is the reason?” “I am picking up leaves, friend.” “What are you going to do?” “I am going to provide food for one monk.” “Happy indeed the monk who shall eat your leaves!” “What else can I do, master? I intend to provide for him with the leaves I have myself gathered.” “Well then, come here.” “What do you wish me to do, master?” “Take these fish and tie them up in bundles to sell for a pada, a half-pada, and a penny.”*";
P_HTM[2026]="***Mahāduggata did as he was told, and the residents of the city bought them for the monks they had invited. He was still engaged in tying up bundles of fish when the time came for the monks to go on their rounds for alms, whereupon he said to the fisherman, “I must go now, friend; it is time for the monks to come.” “Are there any bundles of fish left?” “No, friend, they are all gone.” “Well then, here are four redfish which I buried in the sand for my own use. If you intend to provide food for the monks, take them with you.” So saying, he gave him the redfish.*";
P_HTM[2027]="***Now as the Teacher surveyed the world on the morning of that day, he observed that Mahāduggata had entered the Net of his Knowledge. And he considered within himself, “What is going to happen? Yesterday Mahāduggata and his wife worked for hire that they might provide food for one monk. Which monk will he obtain?” And he came to the following conclusion, “The residents will obtain monks to entertain in their houses according to the names written on the leaf; none other monk will Mahāduggata obtain, save only me.” Now the Buddhas are said to show particular tenderness to poor men. So when the Teacher, very early in the morning, had attended to his bodily needs, he said to himself, “I will bestow my favor on Mahāduggata.” And he went into the Perfumed Chamber and sat down.*";
P_HTM[2028]="***When Mahāduggata went into his house with the fish, the Yellowstone Throne of Sakka showed signs of heat. Sakka looked about and said to himself, “What can be the reason for this?” And he considered within himself, “Yesterday Mahāduggata and his wife worked for hire that they might provide food for one monk; which monk will he obtain?” Finally he came to the following conclusion, “Mahāduggata will obtain none other monk than the Buddha, who is sitting in the Perfumed Chamber with this thought in his mind, ‘I will bestow my favor on Mahāduggata.’ Now it is Mahāduggata’s intention to offer the Tathāgata a meal of his own making, consisting of porridge and rice and leaf-curry. Suppose I were to go to Mahā-duggata’s house and offer to act as cook?”*";
P_HTM[2029]="***Accordingly Sakka disguised himself, went to the vicinity of his house and asked, “Would anyone like to hire a man to work for him?” Mahāduggata saw him and said to him, “Sir, what kind of work can you do?” “Master, I am a man-of-all-work; there is nothing I do not know how to do; among other things I know how to cook porridge and boil rice.” “Sir, we need your services, but we have no money to pay you.” “What work is it you have to do?” “I wish to provide food for one monk and I should like to have some one prepare the porridge and rice.” “If you intend to provide food for a monk, it will not be necessary for you to pay me; is it not proper that I should perform a work of merit?” “If that is the case, very well, sir; come in.” So Sakka entered the poor man’s house, had him bring the rice and other articles of food, and then dismissed him, saying, “Go fetch the monk allotted to you.”*";
P_HTM[2030]="***Now the solicitor of alms had sent to the houses of the residents the monks according to the names on the leaf. Mahāduggata met him and said to him, “Give me the monk allotted to me.” The solicitor immediately recollected what he had done and replied, “I forgot to allot you a monk.” Mahāduggata felt as if a sharp dagger had been thrust into his belly. Said he, “Sir, why are you ruining me? Yesterday you urged me to give alms. So my wife and I worked all day for hire, and to-day I got up early in the morning to gather leaves, went to the bank of the river, and spent the day picking up leaves; give me one monk!” And he wrung his arms and burst into tears.*";
P_HTM[2031]="***People gathered about and asked, “What is the matter, Mahāduggata?” He told them the facts, whereupon they asked the solicitor, “Is it true, as this man alleges, that you urged him to hire himself out for service to provide food for a monk?” “Yes, noble sirs.” “You have done a grave wrong in that, while making arrangements for so many monks, you failed to allot this man a single monk.” The solicitor was troubled by what they said and said to him, “Mahāduggata, do not ruin me. You are putting me to great inconvenience. The residents have taken to their several houses the monks allotted to them according to the names written on the leaf, and there is no monk in my own house whom I can take away and give to you. But the Teacher is even now sitting in the Perfumed Chamber, having just bathed his face; and without are seated kings, royal princes, commanders-in-chief, and others, waiting for him to come forth, that they may take his bowl and accompany him on his way. Now the Buddhas are wont to show particular tenderness to a poor man. Therefore go to the monastery, pay obeisance to the Teacher, and say to him, ‘I am a poor man, Reverend Sir; bestow your favor on me.’ If you have merit, you will undoubtedly obtain what you seek.”*";
P_HTM[2032]="***So Mahāduggata went to the monastery. Now on previous occasions he had been seen at the monastery as an eater of remnants of food. Therefore the kings, royal princes, and others said to him, “Mahāduggata, this is not meal-time; why do you come here?” “Sirs,” he replied, “I know it is not meal-time; but I have come to pay obeisance to the Teacher.” Then he went to the Perfumed Chamber, laid his head on the threshold, paid obeisance to the Teacher with the Five Rests, and said, “Reverend Sir, in this city there is no man poorer than I. Be my refuge; bestow favor on me.”*";
P_HTM[2033]="***The Teacher opened the door of the Perfumed Chamber, took down his bowl, and placed it in the poor man’s hands. It was as though Mahāduggata had received the glory of a Universal Monarch. Kings, royal princes, and others gasped at each other. Now when the Teacher presents his bowl to a man, no one dares take it from him by force. But they spoke thus, “Sir Mahāduggata, give us the Teacher’s bowl; we will give you all this money for it. You are a poor man; take the money. What need have you of the bowl?” Mahāduggata said, “I will give it to no one; I have no need of money; all that I desire is to provide food for the Teacher.” All without exception begged him to give them the bowl, but failing to get it, desisted.*";
P_HTM[2034]="***The king thought to himself, “Money will not tempt Mahāduggata to give up the bowl, and no one can take from him the bowl which the Teacher has given him of his own free will. But how much will this man’s alms amount to? When the time comes for him to present his alms, I will take the Teacher aside, conduct him to my house, and give him the food I have made ready.” This was the thought in his mind even as he accompanied the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[2035]="***Now Sakka king of gods prepared porridge, rice, leaf-curry, and other kinds of food, made ready a seat worthy of the Teacher, and sat down awaiting the arrival of the Teacher. Mahāduggata conducted the Teacher to his house and invited him to enter. Now the house in which he lived was so low that it was impossible to enter without bowing the head. But the Buddhas never bow their heads in entering a house. When they enter a house, the earth sinks or the house rises. This is the fruit of the generous alms they have given. And when they have departed and gone, all becomes as before. Therefore the Teacher entered the house standing quite erect, and having entered, sat down on the seat prepared by Sakka. When the Teacher had seated himself, the king said to Mahāduggata, “Sir Mahāduggata, when we begged you to give us the Teacher’s bowl, you refused to do so. Now let us see what sort of alms you have prepared for the Teacher.”*";
P_HTM[2036]="***At that moment Sakka uncovered the dishes and showed the porridge, rice, and other kinds of food. The perfume and fragrance thereof enveloped the whole city. The king surveyed the porridge, rice, and other foods, and said to the Exalted One, “Reverend Sir, when I came here, I thought to myself, ‘How much will Mahāduggata’s alms amount to? When he presents his alms, I will take the Teacher aside, conduct him to my house, and give him the food I have myself prepared.’ But as a matter of fact, I have never yet seen such provisions as these. If I remain here, Mahāduggata will be annoyed; therefore I will depart.” And having paid obeisance to the Teacher, he departed. Sakka presented the porridge and other food to the Teacher and faithfully ministered to his needs. After the Teacher had eaten his meal, he returned thanks, rose from his seat and departed. Sakka made a sign to Mahāduggata, who thereupon took the Teacher’s bowl and accompanied him.*";
P_HTM[2037]="***Sakka turned back, stopped at the door of Mahāduggata’s house, and looked up at the sky. Thereupon there came down from the sky a rain of the seven kinds of jewels. The jewels filled all the vessels in his house and the very house itself. When there was no room left in the house, they took the children in their arms, carried them outside, and stood there. When Mahāduggata returned from accompanying the Teacher and saw the children standing outside the house, he asked, “What does this mean?” “Our whole house is filled with the seven kinds of jewels, insomuch that there is no room to go in.” Mahāduggata thought to himself, “To-day have I received the reward of the alms I have given.” Thereupon he went to the king, made obeisance to him, and when the king asked him why he had come, said, “Your majesty, my house is filled with the seven kinds of jewels; accept this wealth.” The king thought, “This very day have the alms given to the Buddhas reached their consummation.” And he said to the man, “What must you have to remove the jewels?” “Your majesty, it will require a thousand carts to remove all of this wealth.” The king sent out a thousand carts and had the wealth removed and dumped in the palace court. It made a heap as high as a palm-tree.*";
P_HTM[2038]="***The king assembled the citizens and asked them, “Is there any one in this city who possesses so much wealth as this?” “There is not, your majesty.” “What ought to be done for a man possessed of so much wealth as this?” “He should be given the post of treasurer, your majesty.” The king bestowed high honor upon him and gave him the post of treasurer. Then he pointed out the site of a house occupied by a former treasurer, and said to him, “Have the bushes that are growing there removed, build a house, and reside in it.”*";
P_HTM[2039]="***As the ground was being cleared and leveled, urns of treasure came to light with their brims touching each other. When Mahāduggata reported this to the king, the latter said, “It is through your merit that these urns have come to light; you alone shall have them.” When Mahāduggata had completed the house, he gave alms for seven days to the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha. Thereafter, having lived out his allotted term of life in the performance of works of merit, Mahāduggata was reborn at the end of his life in the World of the Gods. After enjoying celestial glory for the space of the interval between the appearances of two Buddhas, he passed from that state of existence in the dispensation of the present Buddha, and was conceived in the womb of the daughter of a rich merchant of Sāvatthi, a retainer of the Elder Sāriputta.*";
P_HTM[2040]="***5 b. Story of the Present: Paṇḍita, the seven-year-old novice*";
P_HTM[2041]="***When the mother and father of the merchant’s daughter learned that she had conceived a child in her womb, they saw to it that she received the treatment necessary for the protection of the embryo. After a time the longing of pregnancy came upon her and she thought to herself, “Oh that I might make offerings of the choicest portions of redfish to the five hundred monks headed by the Captain of the Faith; oh that I might put on yellow robes, sit down in the outer circle of the seats, and partake of the food left uneaten by these monks!” She expressed her longing to her mother and father and fulfilled her longing, whereupon it subsided. Thereafter she held seven festivals more, and provided the five hundred monks headed by the Captain of the Faith with the choicest portions of redfish. (All is to be understood precisely as in the Story of the Youth Tissa.) This was the fruit of his offering of the choicest portions of redfish in his former existence as the poor man, Mahāduggata.*";
P_HTM[2042]="***Now on the day appointed for the naming of the child the mother said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, confer the moral precepts on your servant.” Said the Elder, “What is the name of this child?” “Reverend Sir, from the day this child came into existence in my womb, those of this household who were stupid and deaf and dumb became wise; therefore the name of my child shall be Youth Wiseman, Paṇḍita Dāraka.” The Elder then conferred the moral precepts on the child.*";
P_HTM[2043]="***Now from the day of his birth his mother resolved, “I will not interfere with the desire of my son.” When he was seven years old, he said to his mother, “I desire to become a monk under the Elder.” She replied, “Very well, dear child; long ago I made up my mind not to interfere with your desire.” So she invited the Elder to her house, provided him with food, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, your servant desires to become a monk; I will bring him to the monastery this evening.” Having dismissed the Elder, she gathered her kinsfolk together and said to them, “This very day I shall render the honors appropriate to the occasion of my son’s leaving the life of a layman.” So she prepared rich gifts and taking the child to the monastery, committed him to the hands of the Elder, saying,“Reverend Sir, admit this child to the Order.”*";
P_HTM[2044]="***The Elder spoke to him of the difficulties of the religious life. The boy replied, “I will carry out your admonitions, Reverend Sir.” “Well then,” said the Elder, “come!” So saying, he wetted his hair, taught him the Formula of Meditation on the first five of the constituent parts of the body, and received him into the Order. His mother and father remained at the monastery for seven days, making offerings consisting wholly of the choicest portions of redfish to the congregation of monks headed by the Buddha. Having so done, they returned home.*";
P_HTM[2045]="***On the eighth day the Elder took the novice with him to the village. He did not, however, accompany the monks. Why was this? Not yet had the novice acquired a pleasing manner of taking his bowl and robe; not yet had he acquired a pleasing manner of walking, standing, sitting, and lying. Besides, the Elder had duties to perform at the monastery. So when the congregation of monks had entered the village for alms, the Elder went the rounds of the entire monastery, swept the places that had not been swept, filled the empty vessels with water for drinking and refreshment, and restored to their proper places the beds, chairs, and other articles of furniture that had been tossed about in disorder. Having so done, he entered the village. It was because he did not wish to give the heretics who might enter the empty monastery a chance to say, “Behold the habitations of the disciples of the hermit Gotama!” that he set the entire monastery to rights before entering the village. Therefore on that particular day, having instructed the novice how to take his bowl and robe, he entered the village somewhat later than usual.*";
P_HTM[2046]="***As the novice proceeded with his preceptor he saw a ditch by the roadside. “What is that, Reverend Sir?” he asked. “That is called a ditch, novice.” “What do they use it for?” “They use it to lead the water this way and that, for irrigating their grain fields.” “But, Reverend Sir, has the water reason or bile?” “It has not, brother.” “Reverend Sir, can they lead anything like this, which lacks reason, to whatever place they desire?” “Yes, brother.” The novice thought to himself, “If they can lead even such a thing as this, which lacks reason, to whatever place they wish, why cannot also they that have reason bring their own reason under control of their own will and strive for the attainment of Arahatship?”*";
P_HTM[2047]="***Proceeding farther, he saw arrow-makers heating reeds and sticks over the fire and straightening them by sighting with them out of the corner of their eye. “What are these men, Reverend Sir?” he asked. “They are arrow-makers, brother.” “What are they doing?” “They are heating reeds and sticks over the fire and straightening them.” “Have these reeds the power of reason, Reverend Sir?” “They are without the power of reason, brother.” The novice thought to himself, “If they can take these reeds, which are without the power of reason, and straighten them by heating them over the fire, why cannot also creatures who have reason bring their own reason under control and strive for the attainment of Arahatship?”*";
P_HTM[2048]="***Proceeding yet farther, he saw carpenters fashioning spokes, rims, naves, and other parts of wheels. “Reverend Sir, what are these men?” he asked. “These men are carpenters, brother.” “What are they doing?” “Out of pieces of wood they make wheels and other parts of carts and other vehicles, brother.” “But do these objects possess reason, Reverend Sir?” “No, brother, they are without the power of reason.” Then this thought occurred to the novice, “If they can take these senseless logs of wood and make wheels and so forth out of them, why cannot also creatures who have the power of reason bring their own reason under control and strive for the attainment of Arahatship?”*";
P_HTM[2049]="***Having seen all these things, the novice said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, if you will be so good as to take your bowl and robe, I should like to turn back.” The Elder, not allowing himself to think, “This young novice who has but just been received into the Order addresses me as if I were a lesser Buddha,” said, “Bring them, novice,” and took his own bowl and robe. The novice paid obeisance to the Elder and turned back, saying, “Reverend Sir, when you bring me food, be kind enough to bring me only the choicest portions of redfish.” “Where shall we get them, brother?” “Reverend Sir, if you cannot obtain them through your own merit, you will succeed in obtaining them through my merit.”*";
P_HTM[2050]="***The Elder thought to himself, “Should this young novice sleep out of doors some danger may befall him.” Therefore he gave him a key and said to him, “Open the door of the cell where I reside, go in, and remain there.” The novice did so. Sitting down, he strove to gain a knowledge of his own body and to master the thought of his own personality. Through the power of his virtue Sakka’s seat showed signs of heat. Sakka considered within himself, “What can be the cause of this?” and came to the following conclusion, “The novice Paṇḍita has given his preceptor his bowl and robe and turned back, saying, ‘I will strive for the attainment of Arahatship;’ therefore I also ought to go there.”*";
P_HTM[2051]="***So Sakka addressed the Four Great Kings, saying, “Drive away the birds that make their homes in the monastery park and guard the approaches from all quarters.” And he said to the moon-deity, “Hold back the disk of the moon;” and to the sun-deity, “Hold back the disk of the sun.” Having so said, he went in person to the place where hung the rope for opening and closing the door and stood on guard. There was not so much as the sound of a withered leaf in the monastery. The novice’s mind was tranquil, and in the course of his meal he mastered the thought of his own personality and obtained the Three Fruits.*";
P_HTM[2052]="***The Elder thought, “The novice is seated in the monastery, and I can obtain food in such and such a house to assist him in his preparation.” So he went to the house of a certain supporter, whose love and respect for him he well knew. Now the members of this household had obtained some redfish that very day and were seated, watching for the Elder to come. When they saw him coming, they said to him, “Reverend Sir, those who came here have done you a good turn.” And they invited him in, gave him broth and hard food, and presented him with alms consisting of the choicest portions of redfish. The Elder allowed the purpose of his visit to be known, whereupon the members of the household said to him, “Eat your meal, Reverend Sir, and you shall also receive food to take with you.” So when the Elder had finished his meal, they filled his bowl with food consisting of the choicest portions of redfish and gave it to him. The Elder, thinking to himself, “The novice must be hungry,” hastened back to the monastery with all speed.*";
P_HTM[2053]="***Very early on the morning of that day the Teacher ate his breakfast and went to the monastery. And he considered within himself, “The novice Paṇḍita has given his preceptor his bowl and robe and turned back, saying, ‘I will strive for the attainment of Arahatship. Will he reach the goal of his religious life?” Perceiving that he had attained the Three Fruits, he considered, “Is he or is he not predestined to attain Arahatship?” Perceiving that he was, he considered, “Will he or will he not be able to attain Arahatship even before he has finished his breakfast?” And straightway he perceived that he would. Then the following thought occurred to him, “Sāriputta is hastening to the monastery with food for the novice and may perhaps interfere with his meditations. I will therefore sit down in the battlemented chamber on guard. When Sāriputta arrives, I will ask him four questions. While these questions are being answered, the novice will attain Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.”*";
P_HTM[2054]="***So he went and took his stand in the battlemented chamber, and when the Elder arrived, the Teacher asked him four questions, each of which the Elder answered correctly. These were the questions and answers. The Teacher asked Sāriputta, “Sāriputta, what have you brought?” “Food, Reverend Sir.” “What does food produce, Sāriputta?” “Sensation, Reverend Sir.” “What does sensation produce, Sāriputta?” “Material form, Reverend Sir.” “What does material form produce, Sāriputta?” “Contact, Reverend Sir.”*";
P_HTM[2055]="***This is the meaning of these questions: When a hungry man eats food, the food banishes his hunger and brings a pleasurable sensation. As a result of the pleasurable sensation which comes to a man who is satisfied by the eating of food, his body takes on a beautiful color; and for this reason it is said that sensation produces material form. Now the man who is satisfied by the material form which is the product of the food he has eaten, that man is filled with joy and delight; and with the thought in his mind, “Now I have attained happiness,” whether he lies down or sits down obtains pleasurable contact.*";
P_HTM[2056]="***While these four questions were being answered, the novice attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. Then the Teacher said to the Elder, “Go, Sāriputta, give the food to your novice.” The Elder went and knocked at the door. The novice came out, took the bowl from the Elder’s hands, set it aside, and began to fan the Elder with a palm-leaf fan. The Elder said to him, “Novice, eat your breakfast.” “But you, Reverend Sir?” “I have eaten my breakfast; you eat yours.” Thus did a child seven years old, already a monk, on the eighth day, like a freshly blossomed water-lily, reflecting upon the subjects of self-examination, sit down and eat his breakfast.*";
P_HTM[2057]="***When he had washed his bowl and put it away, the moon-deity released the moon and the sun-deity the sun; the Four Great Kings abandoned their watch over the four quarters; Sakka the king of the gods gave up his post at the rope of the door; and the sun vanished from mid-heaven and disappeared.*";
P_HTM[2058]="***The monks were annoyed and said, “Unwonted darkness has come on; the sun has disappeared from mid-heaven, and the novice has only just eaten his breakfast; what does this mean?” The Teacher, aware of what they were saying, came and asked, “Monks, what are you saying?” They told him. He replied, “Yes, monks, while this novice, fruitful in good works, was striving for the attainment of Arahatship, the moon-deity held back the disk of the moon and the sun-deity the disk of the sun; the Four Great Kings stood on guard over the four quarters in the monastery park; Sakka king of the gods kept watch over the rope of the door, and I myself, although a Buddha, was unable to remain in an attitude of repose, but went to the battlemented chamber and stood guard over my son. Wise men who observe ditch-diggers leading the water, arrow-makers straightening their arrows, and carpenters fashioning wood meditate on these things, obtain the mastery over themselves, and attain Arahatship.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2059]="***80. Ditch-diggers lead the water, arrow-makers straighten their shafts,*";
P_HTM[2060]="***Carpenters straighten the wood; wise men control themselves.*";
P_HTM[2061]="*[65] 6. Lakuṇḍakabhaddiyattheravatthu**6. Unshaken as a Rock*";
P_HTM[2062]="***81. Even as a solid rock...*";
P_HTM[2063]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya.*";
P_HTM[2064]="***The story goes that certain novices and others yet unconverted, on seeing the Elder, used to pull his hair and tweak his ears and nose, saying, “Uncle, you tire not of Religion? You take delight in it?” But the Elder showed no resentment, took no offense. The monks discussed the matter in the Hall of Truth, saying, “Behold, brethren, when novices and others, seeing Elder Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya, plague him thus and so, he shows no resentment, takes no offense.” The Teacher came in and asked, “Monks, what are you talking about?” They told him. He replied, “Yes, monks, they that have rid themselves of the Depravities show no anger or resentment, but are unmoved, unshaken, like solid rock.” So saying, he joined the connection, and instructing them in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2065]="***81. Even as a solid rock is not moved by the wind,*";
P_HTM[2066]="***So wise men are not stirred by blame or praise.*";
P_HTM[2067]="*[66] 7. Kāṇamātuvatthu**7. After the Storm, Calm*";
P_HTM[2068]="***82. Even as a lake, deep, limpid, clear,*";
P_HTM[2069]="***So do wise men become calm after listening to the laws.*";
P_HTM[2070]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Mother of Kāṇā. The story is found in the Vinaya.*";
P_HTM[2071]="***For at that time the Mother of Kāṇā was forced to send her daughter to her husband’s house empty-handed because on four different occasions she gave cakes she had fried to four monks; and in accordance with the precept laid down by the Teacher in such cases, Kāṇā’s husband had taken to himself another wife. When Kāṇā learned the circumstances, she said to herself, “These monks have ruined my married life.” And from that time on she reviled and abused every monk she saw. Indeed the monks did not dare to go into the street where she lived.*";
P_HTM[2072]="***The Teacher, knowing what had happened, went there. The Mother of Kāṇā caused the Teacher to sit down in a seat already provided and gave him rice-porridge and hard food. After the Teacher had eaten his breakfast, he asked, “Where is Kāṇā?” “Reverend Sir, when she saw you, she was troubled and is now weeping.” “For what reason?” “Reverend Sir, she has been reviling and abusing the monks. Therefore when she saw you, she was troubled and is now weeping.”*";
P_HTM[2073]="***The Teacher caused her to be summoned and said to her, “Kāṇā, why was it that when you saw me you were troubled and hid yourself and wept?” Then her mother told the Teacher what she had done. Said the Teacher to her, “But, Mother of Kāṇā, did you give my disciples what they took, or did you not?” “I gave them what they took, Reverend Sir.” “If my disciples came to the door of your house while going their rounds for alms and accepted the alms which you gave them, what blame rests upon my disciples for so doing?” “Their reverences are in no wise to blame, Reverend Sir; she alone is to blame.”*";
P_HTM[2074]="***Turning to the daughter, the Teacher said, “Kāṇā, I learn that my disciples came to the door of your house while they were going their rounds for alms and that your mother gave them some cakes; what blame rests upon my disciples for so doing?” “Their reverences are in no wise to blame, Reverend Sir; she alone is to blame.” Then Kāṇā paid obeisance to the Teacher and begged him to forgive her. The Teacher preached the Law to her in orderly sequence, and she obtained the Fruit of Conversion. The Teacher then rose from his seat and set out for the monastery.*";
P_HTM[2075]="***On his way to the monastery he passed through the palace court. The king saw him and said to one of his courtiers, “That is the Teacher, is it not?” “Yes, your majesty.” So the king sent the courtier out, saying to him, “Go tell the Teacher that I am on my way to pay my respects to him.” As the Teacher stood in the palace court, the king approached him, paid obeisance to him, and said, “Reverend Sir, where have you been?” “I have been to the house of the Mother of Kāṇā, your majesty.” “Why did you go there, Reverend Sir?” “I was informed that Kāṇā was reviling the monks; it was for that reason that I went.” “Did you put a stop to her abuse, Reverend Sir?” “Yes, your majesty, she has ceased her abuse and has become mistress of wealth that transcends the world.” “Very well, Reverend Sir, you have made her mistress of wealth that transcends the world; I will make her mistress of the wealth that is in the world.”*";
P_HTM[2076]="***So the king paid obeisance to the Teacher, returned to his palace, sent a great covered carriage for Kāṇā, adorned her with all the adornments, made her as his own oldest daughter, and proclaimed, “Let those who are able to support my daughter take her.” Now a certain great noble who was concerned with everything, replied, “Your majesty, I am able to support the king’s daughter.” So saying, he took her to his home, endowed her with all his lordly power and wealth, and said to her, “Do works of merit according to your own good pleasure.”*";
P_HTM[2077]="***Thenceforth, having posted men at the four doors, Kāṇā ministered to all the monks and nuns who came to her house, seeking yet more, but failing to find them. Abundant supplies of food, both hard and soft, were always ready in Kāṇā’s house and flowed through her door like a great flood.*";
P_HTM[2078]="***The monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “Long ago, brethren, four aged Elders offended Kāṇā. But Kāṇā, offended though she was, received the blessing of faith at the hands of the Teacher. The Teacher again made the door of her house worthy for the monks to approach. Now she cannot find as many monks and nuns as she would like to provide for. Oh, how wonderful is the power of the Buddhas!” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it you are sitting here now talking about?” They told him. He replied, “Monks, this is not the first time those four aged Elders offended Kāṇā; the same thing happened in a previous state of existence also. This is not the first time I have persuaded Kāṇā to obey my words; I did the same thing in a previous state of existence also.” The monks desired to hear more about the matter. So at their request, the Teacher related the Babbu Jātaka, as follows;*";
P_HTM[2079]="***Where one cat is found, there a second appears.*";
P_HTM[2080]="***And a third, and a fourth; this is the hole those cats sought.*";
P_HTM[2081]="***Having related the Jātaka in detail, the Teacher identified the characters as follows, “At that time the four aged Elders were the four cats, the mouse was Kāṇā, and the gem-cutter was I myself. Thus, monks, in times past also Kāṇā, whose heart was sad and whose mind was turbid, became through my words possessed of a mind limpid as a lake of still water.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2082]="***82. Even as a lake, deep, limpid, clear,*";
P_HTM[2083]="***So do wise men become calm after listening to the laws.*";
P_HTM[2084]="*[67] 8. Pañcasatabhikkhuvatthu**8. A Pack of Vagabonds*";
P_HTM[2085]="***83. Everywhere good men practice renunciation; good men talk not as if given to sensual pleasure;*";
P_HTM[2086]="***Wise men, touched either by happiness or by sorrow, show no change.*";
P_HTM[2087]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to five hundred monks. The story begins at Verañjā.*";
P_HTM[2088]="***For in the First Period of Enlightenment the Exalted One paid a visit to Verañjā, and, at the invitation of the Brahman Verañjā, went into residence there for the rainy season with five hundred monks. Now the Brahman Verañjā came under the spell of Māra to such an extent that not for a single day did he give a thought to the Teacher. Moreover there was a famine in Verañjā. The monks went throughout and about Verañjā for alms, but, receiving none, became exhausted. Thereupon horse-dealers provided them with steamed grain in pattha measures. Elder Moggallāna the Great, seeing that they were exhausted, desired to feed them sap of the earth and sought permission for them to enter Uttarakuru for alms, but the Teacher refused his request. Not for a single day were the monks anxious about food, but continued to live entirely free from desire.*";
P_HTM[2089]="***After the Teacher had resided there for three months, he notified the Brahman Verañja of his intention to leave and the Brahman did him honor and reverence. The Teacher established him in the Refuges, and departed. After journeying from place to place, the Teacher reached Sāvatthi in due course at a certain time, and took up his residence at Jetavana. The residents of Sāvatthi presented food to the Teacher in honor of his arrival.*";
P_HTM[2090]="***Now at that time, by the kindness of the monks, five hundred eaters of refuse lived within the monastery inclosure. After eating remnants of choice food left by the monks, they would lie down to sleep. When they arose, they would go to the bank of the river and shout and jump and wrestle and play. Both within and without the monastery, they did nothing but misbehave.*";
P_HTM[2091]="***The monks discussed their actions in the Hall of Truth: “Brethren, only look at those eaters of refuse! When there was a famine in Verañjā, they were guilty of no impropriety. But now, after eating all sorts of choice food, they go about indulging in all manner of improprieties. But at Verañjā the monks lived peacefully and at the present time also they are living in peace and quiet.”*";
P_HTM[2092]="***The Teacher entered the Hall of Truth and asked the monks what they were discussing. When they told him, he said, “In former times also these men were guilty of the same conduct. In former times, reborn as five hundred asses, they took leavings of liquor made of the moist juices of the grape, drunk by five hundred thoroughbreds of Sindh, and kneading the leavings with water and straining them through towels, they drank this juiceless, vile drink, called “strained water.” And straightway becoming as drunk as though they had drunk wine, they went about shouting.*";
P_HTM[2093]="***From drinking “strained water,” a juiceless, vile drink, the asses became drunk. But the Sindh horses, which drank the choice liquor, did not become drunk.*";
P_HTM[2094]="***O King, a low fellow who drinks but little, no sooner touches his drink than he is drunk.*";
P_HTM[2095]="***But a man who is well-born and patient does not become drunk by drinking the finest liquor.*";
P_HTM[2096]="***Having related this Valodaka Jātaka in detail, the Teacher said, “Thus, monks, good men, renouncing the evil principle of desire, are not subject to change in times of happiness or of sorrow.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2097]="***83. Everywhere good men practice renunciation; good men talk not as if given to sensual pleasure;*";
P_HTM[2098]="***Wise men, touched either by happiness or by sorrow, show no change.*";
P_HTM[2099]="*[68] 9. Dhammikattheravatthu**9. Husband and Wife*";
P_HTM[2100]="***84. Not for his own sake...*";
P_HTM[2101]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Dhammika.*";
P_HTM[2102]="***In Sāvatthi, we are told, a certain lay disciple lived the life of a householder righteously and justly. Desiring to become a monk, he said to his wife one day as he sat chatting with her pleasantly, “Dear wife, I desire to become a monk.” She replied, “Husband, wait until I give birth to the child that is in my womb.” He waited until the child was old enough to walk and then asked her again. She replied, “Husband, wait until this child comes of age.” So he said to himself, “What difference does it make to me whether she gives me her permission or not? I will secure Release from Suffering for myself.”*";
P_HTM[2103]="***Accordingly he retired from the world and became a monk. Having obtained a Subject of Meditation, by striving and struggling, he reached the consummation of his own religious life. Then he returned once more to Sāvatthi to see his family and preached the Law to his son. Thereupon his son retired from the world, became a monk, and in no long time attained Arahatship. His former wife thought to herself, “Both of those for whom I desired to live the household life, have become monks; what interest has this life for me any longer? I will become a nun.” Accordingly she went forth and became a nun, and in no long time she also became an Arahat.*";
P_HTM[2104]="***One day the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “Our brother disciple Dhammika, because he was firmly established in the Law, after he had retired from the world, became a monk, and, attaining Arahatship, set an example for his son.” The Teacher came in and asked, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” They told him. Said he, “Monks, a wise man should desire success neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another. A righteous man should seek refuge only in the Law.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2105]="***84. Not for his own sake, not for the sake of another, should a man desire son or wealth or kingdom;*";
P_HTM[2106]="***He should not seek to gain success for himself by unjust means; so will he be upright, wise, and righteous.*";
P_HTM[2107]="*[69] 10. Dhammassavanavatthu**10. Few There Be That Find It*";
P_HTM[2108]="***85-86. Of all men there are few...*";
P_HTM[2109]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the subject of hearing the Law.*";
P_HTM[2110]="***We are told that the residents of a certain street in Sāvatthi banded themselves together, gave alms in common, and determined to spend the entire night in hearing the Law. But they were unable to listen to the Law all night long. Some were overcome with sexual passion and returned home again; others were overcome with hatred; others, falling prey to sloth and torpor, sat down in their places, nodded, and failed to hear the Law.*";
P_HTM[2111]="***On the following day the monks heard of the incident and discussed it in the Hall of Truth. The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” They told him. “Monks, creatures here in this world are for the most part attached to existence, and live clinging to the three modes of existence. Those that go to the other shore are few in number.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2112]="***85. Of all men there are few that go to the other shore;*";
P_HTM[2113]="***The rest of mankind merely run up and down the bank.*";
P_HTM[2114]="***86. But those who conform to the Law, when the Law is rightly preached,*";

P_HTM[2118]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to fifty visiting monks.*";
P_HTM[2119]="***Fifty monks who had passed the rainy season in the kingdom of Kosala came to Jetavana at the close of the rainy season for the purpose of seeing the Teacher; and having paid obeisance to the Teacher, sat down respectfully on one side. The Teacher, after listening to the story of their experiences, instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2120]="***87. Abandoning the dark state, the wise man should adopt the bright state.*";
P_HTM[2121]="***Leaving home, he should go forth to the homeless life. In solitude, where enjoyment is hard to find,*";

P_HTM[2130]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jīvaka’s Mango-grove with reference to a question asked by Jīvaka. The Story of Jīvaka is related in detail in the Khandhaka.*";
P_HTM[2131]="***Now on a certain occasion Devadatta joined forces with Ajātasattu, climbed Vulture Peak, and out of the wickedness of his heart, saying to himself, “I will kill the Teacher,” hurled down a rock. Two mountain crags caught the rock and splintered it; but one of the flying pieces struck the foot of the Exalted One and caused blood to flow. The Teacher suffered intense pains and was removed by the monks to Maddakucchi. Desiring to go on to Jīvaka’s Mango-grove, the Teacher said to the monks, “Carry me thither.” So the monks took the Teacher and carried him to Jīvaka’s Mango-grove.*";
P_HTM[2132]="***When Jīvaka heard the news, he immediately went to the Teacher and to heal the wound applied an astringent. Then he bound up the wound and said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, I have a patient in the city. As soon as I have visited him, I will return. Let this dressing remain exactly as it is until I return.” So saying, Jīvaka went and treated his patient. But the gate was closed when he returned, and he was therefore unable to enter. Thereupon the following thought occurred to him, “I have committed a grievous fault. I applied an astringent to the foot of the Tathāgata and bound up his wound, just as I should have bound up the wound of any other man. It is now time to remove the bandage. For if the bandage remains unbound all night long, the Exalted One will suffer intense pain.”*";
P_HTM[2133]="***At that moment the Teacher addressed the Elder Ānanda, “Ānanda, Jīvaka returned late in the evening and was unable to enter the gate. This was the thought in his mind, ‘Now it is time to remove the bandage.’ Therefore remove the bandage.” The Elder removed the bandage, whereupon the scar disappeared like bark from a tree. At early dawn Jīvaka hastened to the Teacher’s side and asked, “Reverend Sir, did you suffer intense pain?” Said the Teacher, “Jīvaka, all suffering is extinguished for the Tathāgata, even as when he sat on the Throne of Enlightenment.” And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2134]="***90. For him who has completed his journey, for him who is free from sorrow,*";
P_HTM[2135]="***For him who has freed himself from the bonds which beset him on all sides,*";

P_HTM[2138]="***91. They that are mindful, exert themselves, they take not pleasure in an abode;*";
P_HTM[2139]="***As geese leave a lake, so also do they leave house and home.*";
P_HTM[2140]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the Elder Kassapa the Great.*";
P_HTM[2141]="***For on a certain occasion, after keeping residence during the season of the rains at Rājagaha, the Teacher caused the following announcement to be made to the monks, “At the expiration of a fortnight the Teacher will go forth on a pilgrimage for alms.” We are told that this is a practice of the Buddhas when they desire to go forth on an alms-pilgrimage with the monks. The following consideration presents itself to their minds, “Under these circumstances the monks will scald their bowls and dye their robes and will make the pilgrimage pleasantly.” This, then, was the reason why the Teacher caused the announcement to be made to the monks, “At the expiration of a fortnight I will go forth on a pilgrimage for alms.”*";
P_HTM[2142]="***But while the monks were scalding their bowls and dyeing their robes, the Elder Kassapa the Great washed his robes. The monks were offended at this and said, “Why does the Elder wash his robes? Within and without this city dwell a hundred and eighty million people. So many of these as are not the Elder’s kinsfolk are his supporters; and so many as are not his supporters are his kinsfolk. All these people show honor and reverence to the Elder by providing him with the Four Requisites. If he rejects all their good offices, where will he go? Even were he to go, he would not go farther than Māpamāda Cave.” (Māpamāda Cave, by the way, acquired its name in the following way: Whenever the Teacher reached this cave, he would say to the monks who were to return, “Now you may return; be not heedless, mā pamajjittha.” Thus this cave came to be called Māpamāda Cave.)*";
P_HTM[2143]="***Likewise the Teacher thought as he set out on his pilgrimage, “Within and without this city dwell a hundred and eighty million people, and on occasions of public festivals or disasters, there the monks must go. It is therefore out of the question to leave the monastery empty. But shall I direct all of them to return?” Then the following thought occurred to him, “These people are either kinsfolk or retainers of Kassapa; therefore it is Kassapa whom I should direct to return.” Accordingly he said to the Elder, “Kassapa, it is out of the question to leave the monastery empty, for there is need of monks on occasions of public festivals or disasters; therefore take your own retinue with you and return.” “Very well, Reverend Sir,” replied the Elder and taking his own retinue with him, he returned.*";
P_HTM[2144]="***The monks were offended at this and said, “Did you observe, brethren? Did we not just say, ‘Why is Kassapa the Great washing his robes? He will not accompany the Teacher.’ Everything has happened just as we said it would.” When the Teacher heard the talk of the monks, he turned around, stood still, and said, “Monks, what is this you are saying?” “We are talking about Elder Kassapa the Great, Reverend Sir,” replied the monks, and then repeated their conversation word for word. The Teacher listened to what they had to say and then replied, “Monks, you say, ‘Kassapa is attached to his households and his requisites.’ As a matter of fact, he turned back because it was his desire to obey my command. For in a previous state of existence he made an Earnest Wish and became, like the moon, free from attachment. He made the Earnest Wish, ‘May I be able to approach the households of supporters.’ Kassapa has no attachment for a household or a requisite. Beginning with Kassapa, I preached to all a Path like that of the moon, the Path of the Stock of the Elect.”*";
P_HTM[2145]="***The monks asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, when did the Elder make his Earnest Wish?” “Monks, do you wish to hear?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” Said the Teacher to them, “Monks, a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past, the Buddha Padumuttara appeared in the world.” Beginning with these words, the Teacher related the whole story of the Elder’s deed in a previous state of existence, beginning with his Earnest Wish in the dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara. (The story is related in detail in the Sacred Text of the Elders.) When the Teacher had related in detail this deed of the Elder in a previous state of existence, he said, “Thus, monks, beginning with my son Kassapa, I preached to all a Path like that of the moon, the Path of the Stock of the Elect. My son has no attachment for requisites or households or monasteries or cells. My son has no attachment anywhere, but is like a royal goose which goes down into a lake and swims therein and abides therein.” And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[2151]="***The story goes that this Venerable Elder, finding it annoying to seek alms regularly, made a round for alms through one street in a village, and after eating his breakfast, made another round through a second street, taking boiled rice without sauce or curry, carrying it to the monastery and storing it away. After spending a few days in the bliss of Ecstatic Meditation, he had need of the food and therefore ate it. When the monks found out what he had done, they were offended and reported the matter to the Exalted One. On this occasion the Teacher promulgated the rule forbidding monks to store away food for future use. But since the Elder committed the fault before the rule had been promulgated, and because he was satisfied with but little, the Teacher declared him to be free from guilt. And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[2157]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the Elder Anuruddha.*";
P_HTM[2158]="***For one day, the Elder, whose robes were worn out, was seeking fresh robes on refuse-heaps and in other similar places. Now in the Elder’s third previous existence he had a wife who had been reborn in the World of the Thirty-three as the goddess Jālinī. When the goddess Jālinī saw the Elder seeking cloths for robes, she resolved to aid him. So taking three celestial cloths thirteen cubits long and four cubits wide, and thinking to herself, “If I display these cloths in this manner, the Elder will not take them,” she went to a certain refuse-heap in front of the heap where the Elder was seeking cloths and laid them down in such a way that only the hems were visible.*";
P_HTM[2159]="***As the Elder proceeded on his way seeking cloths, he saw the hems of the celestial garments, whereupon he took hold of them and pulled them out. When he saw that they possessed the dimensions above described, he said to himself, “This indeed is a most remarkable refuse-heap!” And taking them with him, he went his way. On the day he was to make his robes, the Teacher, accompanied by his retinue of five hundred monks, went to the monastery and sat down; likewise did the eighty Chief Elders sit down there also. For the purpose of sewing the robes. Elder Kassapa the Great sat at the foot. Elder Sāriputta in the midst, and Elder Ānanda at the head. The company of monks spun out the thread, the Teacher threaded the needle, and Elder Moggallāna the Great went hither and thither supplying whatever else might be needed.*";
P_HTM[2160]="***The goddess entered the village and incited the inhabitants to give alms, saying, “They are making robes for my noble Elder Anuruddha. The Teacher, surrounded by the eighty Chief Disciples, and accompanied by his retinue of five hundred monks, has gone to the monastery and sat down therein. Take rice-porridge and other provisions and go to the monastery.” During the meal Elder Moggallāna the Great brought large pieces of rose-apple, but the five hundred monks were unable to eat it. Sakka drew a circle about the place where they were making the robes; the earth was as if dyed with lac; there was a great heap of food both soft and hard remaining over and above to the monks who had eaten.*";
P_HTM[2161]="***The monks were offended, and said, “Why should such a quantity of food be provided for so few monks? Judging by the quantity, Anuruddha’s kinsfolk and retainers must have been told, ‘Bring this quantity.’ Elder Anuruddha doubtless wishes to show how many relatives and supporters he has.” The Teacher asked the monks what they were talking about. When they told him, he said, “But, monks, you do not think that this was brought by any orders of Anuruddha, do you?” “Yes, Reverend Sir; we do.” “Monks, my son Anuruddha does not talk thus. They that have rid themselves of the Depravities do not spend their time talking about Requisites; nay, these provisions were produced by the supernatural power of a goddess.” And joining the connection and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";

At this time Elder Kaccāyana the Great resided in the Avanti country. Now this Venerable Elder, although obliged to come from a great distance, regularly attended the preaching of the Law. Therefore, when the Chief Elders sat down, they always left a seat for Elder Kaccāyana the Great.*";
P_HTM[2169]="***Sakka king of gods drew near with his celestial retinue from the two Worlds of Gods, and honored the Teacher with celestial perfumes and garlands. Not seeing Elder Kaccāyana the Great, he thought to himself, “Why is my noble Elder nowhere seen? It would be well if he were to draw near.” At that very moment the Elder drew near, and showed himself sitting in his proper seat. When Sakka saw the Elder, he grasped him firmly by the ankles and said, “It is indeed well that my noble Elder has come; that my noble Elder should come, was the very thing I wished for.” So saying, he rubbed the Elder’s feet with both hands, honored him with perfumes and garlands, and having paid obeisance to him, stood respectfully on one side.*";
P_HTM[2170]="***The monks were offended and said, “Sakka shows respect of persons in rendering honor. Such honor as this, he has not rendered to the rest of the Chief Disciples.

P_HTM[2178]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder Sāriputta.*";
P_HTM[2179]="***For once upon a time, at the conclusion of the rains. Elder Sāriputta, desiring to go forth on an alms-pilgrimage, took leave of the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and departed with his own retinue. Many other monks took leave of the Elder. In dismissing the monks the Elder mentioned the personal and family name of all of the monks who were known by personal and family names. A certain monk who was not known by a personal and family name said, “Oh, that the Elder would greet me by a personal and family name in dismissing me.” But in the great throng of monks the Elder did not notice him. Thereupon the monk said to himself, “He does not greet me as he does the other monks,” and straightway conceived a grudge against the Elder.*";
P_HTM[2180]="***Besides that, the hem of the Elder’s garment brushed against the monk, and this also served to intensify the hatred the monk felt towards the Elder. So soon as he knew that the Elder had passed beyond the entrance to the monastery, he approached the Teacher and said to him, “Reverend Sir, Venerable Sāriputta, doubtless thinking to himself, ‘I am your Chief Disciple,’ struck me a blow that almost broke the chain of my ear. Having so done, without so much as begging my pardon, he set out on his alms-pilgrimage.” The Teacher caused the Elder to be summoned. Thereupon Elder Moggallāna the Great and Elder Ānanda thought to themselves, “The Teacher does not know that our oldest brother did not really strike this monk; the Elder will of course roar a lion’s roar.” Accordingly they decided to convoke an assembly. With key in hand, they opened the doors of the cells, saying, “Approach, Venerable Sirs! Approach, Venerable Sirs! So soon as Venerable Sāriputta is face to face with the Exalted One, he will roar the roar of a lion.” So saying, they convoked a full assembly of the monks.*";
P_HTM[2181]="***Elder Sāriputta came with the rest, saluted the Teacher, and sat down respectfully on one side. When the Teacher questioned him about the incident, the Elder, instead of saying, “I did not strike that monk,” recited his own virtues. Said he, “Reverend Sir, in case any monk has not meditated on the body, he should here find a companion-monk and forsaking him not, go forth on pilgrimage.” Then he said, “Reverend Sir, it is as when they cast on the earth what is clean and then cast on the earth what is unclean.” He compared his own tranquillity of mind to that of the earth, to that of the severed horns of a bull, to that of a Caṇḍāla youth, to water, fire, wind, removal of impurity; he compared the oppression he suffered through his own body to the oppression of snakes and corpses; he compared the maintenance of his own body to that of protuberances of fat. As the Elder described his own virtues in terms of these nine similes, the great earth shook, nine times in succession, to its ocean boundary. As he employed the similes of the removal of impurity, the Caṇḍāla youth, and the protuberances of fat, those monks who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to restrain their tears; while those who had attained Arahatship were filled with religious emotion.*";
P_HTM[2182]="***As the Elder recited his own virtues, remorse pervaded the whole body of the monk who had unjustly slandered him. And straightway he fell at the feet of the Exalted One, admitted that he was guilty of slander, and confessed his fault. The Teacher addressing the Elder, said, “Sāriputta, pardon this deluded man, lest his head split into seven pieces.” Thereupon the Elder crouched before the monk, and extending his clasped hands in an attitude of reverence, said to him, “Reverend Sir, I freely pardon this Venerable monk. Let this Venerable monk also pardon me if I have in any way offended against him.” Thereupon the monks said, “Behold, brethren, the surpassing goodness of the Elder! He cherishes neither anger nor hatred against this lying, slanderous monk. Instead, he crouches before him, extends his hands in an attitude of reverence, and asks his pardon.” When the Teacher heard the talk of the monks, he said, “Monks, what are you talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, it is impossible for Sāriputta and his like to cherish anger or hatred. Sāriputta’s mind is like the great earth, like a threshold, like a pool of still water.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[2188]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a novice of the Elder Tissa.*";
P_HTM[2189]="***The story goes that a certain youth of station, residing at Kosambi, retired from the world and became a monk in the Religion of the Teacher. After making his full profession, he was known as Elder Kosambivāsī Tissa. After he had kept residence during the season of the rains at Kosambi, his supporter brought a set of three robes and offerings of ghee and jagghery and laid them at his feet. Said the Elder to him, “What are these, lay disciple?” “Reverend Sir, have you not kept residence with me during the season of the rains? Those who keep residence in our monastery always receive these offerings; pray accept them, Reverend Sir.” “Never mind, lay disciple, I have no need of them.” “Why is that, Reverend Sir?” “I have no novice to perform the usual offices for me, brother.” “Reverend Sir, if it be true that you have no novice to minister to your needs, my son will become your novice.” The Elder graciously accepted the offer. The lay disciple brought his own son, but seven years old, to the Elder, and committed him into the Elder’s hands, saying, “Pray receive him into the Order, Reverend Sir.” The Elder moistened the boy’s hair, taught him the Formula of Meditation on the first five of the Constituent Parts of the Body, and received him into the Order. The instant the razor touched his hair, he attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[2190]="***The Elder, having received the youth into the Order, remained there for a fortnight. Then, deciding to visit the Teacher, he directed the novice to take the requisites, and set out on his journey. On the way he entered a certain monastery. The novice obtained lodging for the Elder and looked after it for him. While he was thus engaged, it grew dark and he was therefore unable to provide a lodging for himself. When the time came for the novice to wait upon the Elder, the novice approached the Elder and sat down. The Elder asked the novice, “Novice, have you not neglected to provide yourself with lodging?” “Reverend Sir, I have had no opportunity to look after a lodging for myself.” “Well then, remain with me. It will inconvenience you to lodge outside in the place reserved for visitors.” So saying, the Elder taking him with him, entered his own lodging. Now the Elder had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion, and as soon as he lay down, fell asleep. Thereupon the novice thought to himself, “To-day is the third day during which I have occupied the same lodging with my preceptor. If I lie down to sleep the Elder will commit the offense of sleeping in common. Therefore I will spend the night sitting up.” So assuming a cross-legged posture near the bed of his preceptor, he spent the night sitting up.*";
P_HTM[2191]="***The Elder rose at dawn and said to himself, “I must cause the novice to go out.” So he took a fan which was placed at the side of the bed, struck the mat of the novice with the tip of the palm-leaf, and then, tossing the fan into the air, said, “Novice, go out.” The handle of the fan struck the novice in the eye and straightway put out his eye. “What did you say, Reverend Sir?” said the novice. “Rise and go out,” was the reply. The novice, instead of saying, “Reverend Sir, my eye has been put out,” covered his eye with one hand and went out. Moreover, when it was time for him to perform his duties as novice, he did not say, “My eye has been put out,” nor did he remain seated, but covering his eye with one hand and taking a hand-broom in the other hand, he swept out the privy and the wash-room, after which, setting out water for washing the face, he swept out the Elder’s cell.*";
P_HTM[2192]="***When he advanced to present the toothstick to the Elder, he presented it to him with only one hand. His preceptor said to him, “This novice is not properly trained. Is it proper for a novice to present a toothstick to teachers and preceptors with one hand?” “Reverend Sir, I know perfectly well what is the proper form, but one of my hands is not disengaged.” “What is the matter, novice?” Then the novice told him the whole story, beginning at the beginning. When the Elder heard his story, he was deeply moved and said to himself, “Oh, what a grievous thing I have done!” Then he said to the novice, “Pardon me, most excellent youth; I did not know this. Be my refuge.” And extending his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, he crouched on the ground before the feet of a seven-year-old novice. Then said the novice to him, “It was not for this purpose, Reverend Sir, that I spoke. I said this for the purpose of sparing your feelings. You are not to blame in this matter and neither am I. The round of existences alone is to blame for this. It was because I wished to spare you remorse that I did not tell you the real facts.”*";
P_HTM[2193]="***The novice tried to comfort the Elder, but he would not be comforted. Overcome with remorse, he took the novice’s requisites and proceeded to the Teacher. As the Teacher sat, he observed him approaching. The Elder went to the Teacher, saluted him, and exchanged friendly greetings with him. The Teacher asked him, “Monk, is everything well with you? I trust that you have suffered no excessive discomfort.” The Elder replied, “All is well with me, Reverend Sir. I have suffered no excessive discomfort. But here is a young novice whose good qualities surpass anything I have ever seen.” “Why, what has he done, monk?” Thereupon the Elder told him the whole story, beginning at the beginning and concluding as follows, “Reverend Sir, when I asked him to pardon me, he said this to me, ‘You are not to blame in this matter and neither am I. The round of existences alone is to blame for this. Be not disturbed.’ Thus he tried to comfort me, appearing to cherish neither anger nor hatred towards me. His good qualities surpass anything I have ever seen.” Said the Teacher to the Elder, “Monk, those who have rid themselves of the Depravities cherish neither anger nor hatred towards anyone. On the contrary, their senses are in a state of calm and their thoughts are in a state of calm.” So saying, he joined the connection and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[2199]="***For one day thirty forest-dwellers approached the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, and sat down. The Teacher, seeing that they possessed the requisite faculties for attaining Arahatship, addressed Elder Sāriputta as follows, “Sāriputta, do you believe that the quality of faith, when it has been developed and enlarged, is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the Deathless?” In this manner the Teacher questioned the Elder with reference to the Five Moral Qualities.*";
P_HTM[2200]="***Said the Elder, “Reverend Sir, I do not go by the faith of the Exalted One in this matter, that the quality of faith, when it has been developed and enlarged, is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the Deathless. But of course, Reverend Sir, those who have not known the Deathless or seen or perceived or realized or grasped the Deathless by the power of reason, such persons must of necessity go by the faith of others in this matter; namely, that the faculty of faith, when it has been developed and enlarged, is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the Deathless.” Thus did the Elder answer his question.*";
P_HTM[2201]="***When the monks heard this, they began a discussion: “Elder Sāriputta has never really given up false views. Even to-day he refused to believe even the Supremely Enlightened One.” When the Teacher heard this, he said, “Monks, why do you say this? For I asked Sāriputta the following question, ‘Sāriputta, do you believe that without developing the Five Moral Qualities, without developing Tranquillity and Spiritual Insight, it is possible for a man to realize the Paths and the Fruits?’ And he answered me as follows, ‘There is no one who can thus realize the Paths and the Fruits.’ Then I asked him, ‘Do you not believe that there is such a thing as the ripening of the fruit of almsgiving and good works? Do you not believe in the virtues of the Buddhas and the rest?’ But as a matter of fact, Sāriputta walks not by the faith of others, for the reason that he has, in and by himself, attained states of mind to which the Paths and the Fruits lead, by the power of Spiritual Insight induced by Ecstatic Meditation. Therefore he is not open to censure.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";

P_HTM[2209]="***When the Venerable Sāriputta renounced eighty-seven crores of treasure and became a monk, three sisters of his, Cālā, Upacālā, and Sīsūpacālā, and two brothers, Canda and Upasena, entered the Religious Life and the youth Revata alone remained at home. His mother thought to herself, “My son Upatissa has renounced all this wealth and become a monk; three sisters of his and two brothers of his have entered the Religious Life; Revata alone remains at home. Should he make a monk of Revata also, all this wealth will be lost and the family stock will be uprooted. I will get him married while he is yet a mere boy.”*";
P_HTM[2210]="***On his return the Elder Sāriputta addressed the monks as follows, “Brethren, should Revata come here desiring to become a monk, you are to make a monk of him the moment he arrives; my mother and father hold false views; why should their permission be asked? I myself am Revata’s mother and father.”*";
P_HTM[2211]="***When the boy Revata was only seven years old, his mother made preparations for his marriage. She selected a girl of good family, appointed a day for the wedding, adorned the boy with handsome garments and costly ornaments, and accompanied by a large retinue, accompanied him to the house of the girl’s parents. The kinsfolk of both parties were present at the festivities, and placing their hands in a bowl of water, pronounced blessings and wished them prosperity, saying to the bride, “May you behold the Truth your grandmother beheld; may you live long, even as your grandmother.”*";
P_HTM[2212]="***The youth Revata thought to himself, “What do they mean by ‘the Truth her grandmother beheld’?” And he asked them, “Which woman is her grandmother?” They said to him, “Sir, do you not see that woman a hundred and twenty years old with broken teeth and gray hair, full of wrinkles, her body marked with moles, crooked as a ^-shaped rafter? That is her grandmother.” “But will my wife look like that some day?” “Sir, she will if she lives.” Revata thought to himself, “Can it be that even so beautiful a body as that of my wife will so change for the worse through old age? This must be what my brother Upatissa saw. This very day it behooves me to run away and become a monk.”*";
P_HTM[2213]="***Kinsmen assisted the youth and his bride to enter a carriage, and they started out all together. When they had gone a little way, Revata informed them that he wished to relieve himself and said, “Just stop the carriage and I will step out and return immediately.” He stepped out of the carriage, went into a certain thicket, remained there a little while, and then returned. A second and a third time he made the same excuse, stepped down from the carriage, and climbed back again. His kinsmen made up their minds, “Doubtless these calls of nature are habitual with him,” and therefore did not keep close watch of him. When they had gone a little way farther, he made the same excuse, stepped down out of the carriage, and saying, “You drive on ahead; I will follow after you slowly,” disappeared in the direction of a thicket. When his kinsmen heard him say, “I will follow after you,” they drove on ahead.*";
P_HTM[2214]="***Now in this region lived thirty monks; and when Revata had made good his escape, he went to them, paid obeisance to them, and said, “Reverend Sirs, receive me into the Order.” “Brother, you are adorned with all the adornments; we know not whether you are a king’s son or a courtier’s son; how can we receive you into the Order?” “Don’t you recognize me, Reverend Sirs?” “We do not, brother.” “I am the youngest brother of Upatissa.” “Who is this ‘Upatissa’?” “It is just as I say, Reverend Sirs; the reverend monks call my brother ‘Sāriputta,’ and therefore do not know who is meant when the name ‘Upatissa’ is mentioned.” “Why, are you the youngest brother of Sāriputta?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Well then, come! This is the very thing your brother enjoined upon us.” So they removed his jewels, received him into the Order, and sent word to the Elder.*";
P_HTM[2215]="***When the Elder received the message, he said to the Exalted One, “Reverend Sir, since the forest-monks have sent me word, ‘Revata has been received into the Order,’ I should like to go and see him and then return.” The Teacher withheld his permission, saying to him, “Remain here for the present, Sāriputta.” But after a few days the Elder made the same request, and the Teacher withheld his permission as before, saying, “Remain here for the present, Sāriputta; we will go there together later.”*";
P_HTM[2216]="***The novice said to himself, “If I continue to reside here, my kinsmen will follow me and summon me to return home.” Therefore he obtained from the monks a Formula of Meditation as far as Arahatship, took bowl and robe, and set out on his alms-pilgrimage. After journeying a distance of thirty leagues he came to an acacia forest, and there he took up his residence for the season of the rains. Before the three months of the rainy season had passed, he attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[2217]="***9 b. The Buddha visits Revata*";
P_HTM[2218]="***After the terminal festival (pavāraṇā) the Elder Sāriputta again requested the Teacher to permit him to go to his brother. The Teacher said, “We too will go, Sāriputta,” and set out with five hundred monks. When they had gone a little way, the Elder Ānanda, standing at a fork in the road, said to the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, there are two roads to the place where Revata resides: one is protected and is sixty leagues long and men live thereon; the other is a direct route, thirty leagues long, infested by evil spirits; which one shall we take?” “Well, Ānanda, did Sīvali accompany us?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “If Sīvali is with us, take the direct route by all means.” We are told that the Teacher did not say, “I will see to it that you are provided with broth and rice; take the short route,” because he knew within himself, “This is the place where each of these monks will receive gifts that are the fruit of a work of merit;” therefore he said, “If Sīvali is with us, take the direct route.”*";
P_HTM[2219]="***As soon as the Teacher set foot on that road, the forest-deities, thinking to themselves, “We will do honor to the noble Elder Sīvali,” erected rest-houses a league apart, all along the route; and permitting the monks to go no farther than a league, they rose early in the morning, and taking heavenly broth, rice, and other provisions, they went about asking, “Where is the noble Elder Sīvali seated?” The Elder presented to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha the alms they brought him. Thus the Teacher, together with his retinue, went a long and difficult journey of thirty leagues, enjoying the fruit of the merit acquired by one Elder, Sīvali.*";
P_HTM[2220]="***As soon as the Elder Revata learned that the Teacher was approaching, he created by magic a Perfumed Chamber for the Exalted One, and likewise for the monks five hundred pinnacled residences, five hundred covered walks, and five hundred night-quarters and day-quarters. The Teacher spent an entire month there as his guest, enjoying during his stay the fruit of the merit of a single Elder, Sīvali.*";
P_HTM[2221]="***But there were two old monks living there who, when the Teacher entered the acacia forest, said to themselves, “How will this monk be able to perform his meditations while engaged in all this new work? The Teacher shows favoritism to one who is the youngest brother of Sāriputta in coming to live with the builder of all this new work.”*";
P_HTM[2222]="***As the Teacher surveyed the world on the morning of that day, he saw those two monks and became aware of their disposition of mind. So when he had resided there for a month and the day came for him to depart, he resolved that those monks should forget to take with them their measure of oil and their water-vessel and their sandals. Accordingly when he came to depart, withdrawing just beyond the entrance to the monastery, he sent forth his magical power.*";
P_HTM[2223]="***Straightway those monks exclaimed, “I have forgotten this and that;” “I have forgotten it too;” and both turned to retrace their steps. But they were unable to find the place where they had left their belongings, and as they wandered about, the thorns of the acacia-trees pierced their feet. Finally they saw their belongings hanging on the branch of an acacia-tree and taking them with them, departed.*";
P_HTM[2224]="***The Teacher with the Congregation of Monks remained for yet another month, enjoying the fruit of the merit of the Elder Sīvali, and then went into residence at Pubbārāma. Those two old monks bathed their faces early in the morning and said, “Let us go to the house of Visākhā the giver of alms to pilgrims and drink broth.” So they went there and sat down, drinking broth and eating hard food. Visākhā asked them, “Reverend Sirs, did you accompany the Teacher to the place where the Elder Sīvali resides?” “Yes, lay disciple.” “A charming place, Reverend Sirs, where the Elder resides.” “Where does its charm come in? It’s a jungle of acacia-trees full of white thorns, lay disciple, fit only for ascetics to live in.”*";
P_HTM[2225]="***Shortly afterwards two young monks came to the door. The lay disciple provided them with broth and hard food and asked them the same question. They replied, “Lay disciple, it is impossible to describe in words the Elder’s place of residence; it is like the heavenly palace Sudhammā, formed by magical power.” The lay disciple thought to herself, “The visiting monks who came first said one thing and these monks say quite another. It must be that when the Teacher sent forth his magical power, the visiting monks who came first forgot something and had to go back again; on the other hand these monks must have gone there at the time when it was fashioned and perfected by magical power. Knowing the true explanation by her own wisdom, she waited, saying, “I will ask the Teacher when he comes.”*";
P_HTM[2226]="***At that very moment the Teacher, surrounded by the Congregation of Monks, came to the house of Visākhā and sat down in the seats prepared for them. Visākhā reverently ministered to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and at the end of the meal paid obeisance to the Teacher and asked him the following question, “Reverend Sir, some of the monks who accompanied you say, ‘The place where the Elder Revata resides is a forest, a jungle of acacias;’ others say that it is a charming place; what is the explanation of this?” The Teacher replied, “Lay disciple, whether it be in a village or in a forest, or in what place soever Arahats reside, that place is full of delight.” And joining the connection, he preached the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2227]="***98. In a village it may be, or in a forest, on the sea, or on dry land;*";
P_HTM[2228]="***No matter where the Arahats reside, that spot is full of delight.*";
P_HTM[2229]="***At another time the monks began a discussion. “Brethren, why was it that the Elder Sīvali remained for seven days and seven months and seven years in his mother’s womb? Why was it that he was tormented in Hell? How did he come to reach the pinnacle of gain and honor?” The Teacher heard the discussion, asked them what it was about, and when they told him, related the story of the Venerable Elder’s deed in a former existence.*";
P_HTM[2230]="***9 c. Story of the Past: The offering of honey and the siege of a city*";
P_HTM[2231]="***Monks, ninety-one cycles of time ago the Exalted Vipassī appeared in the world, and on a certain occasion making an alms-pilgrimage in the country, returned to the city of his father. The king prepared hospitable offerings for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and sent word to the citizens, “Come and share in my offerings.” Having done so, they made up their minds, “We will give offerings yet more abundant than those given by the king.” So they invited the Teacher, prepared offerings on the following day, and sent an invitation to the king. The king came and seeing their offerings, invited the Teacher for the following day, saying to himself, “I will give offerings yet more abundant than these.” But the king could not outdo the citizens, nor the citizens the king; the sixth time the citizens resolved, “To-morrow we will give such offerings that it will be impossible for the king to say that this or that is lacking in our offerings.” So on the following day they prepared offerings, and looking to see what might be lacking, they observed that there was plenty of honey in cooked form, but no fresh honey. Therefore they sent men out of the four gates of the city to seek fresh honey, providing each man with a thousand pieces of money.*";
P_HTM[2232]="***Now it happened that a certain countryman, going to see the village headman, caught sight of a honeycomb on the branch of a tree by the side of the road. Driving the flies away, he cut off the branch and taking honeycomb, branch and stick, he entered the city, intending to give it to the village headman. One of the men who had been sent out to seek fresh honey saw him and asked him, “Sir, is that honey for sale?” “No, master, it is not for sale.” “Never mind, take this penny and give me the honey.” The countryman thought to himself, “This honeycomb is not worth even a farthing, but this man offers me a penny for it. I suppose he has a great many pennies; I had best raise the price.” So he replied, “I will not give it to you for that.” “Well then, take twopence.” “I will not give it to you for so little as twopence.” The countryman continued to raise the price until finally the man offered him a thousand pieces of money, whereupon he let him have the honey.*";
P_HTM[2233]="***Then he said to the man, “Are you crazy, or have you no way of spending your money? This honey isn’t worth a farthing, but you offer me a thousand pieces of money for it; what is the explanation of this?” “That is perfectly true, sir; but I have some use for this honey and I will tell you what it is.” “What is it, master?” “We have prepared bounteous offerings for the Buddha Vipassī and his retinue of sixty-eight thousand monks, but we have no fresh honey; that is why I want it.” “If that is the case, I will not sell it for a price; if I may receive the merit of the offering, I will give it to you.” When the man returned and related the incident to the citizens, the citizens, impressed with the firm faith of the giver, assented, saying, “Good! good! let him receive the merit of the offering.”*";
P_HTM[2234]="***So the citizens provided seats for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, gave them broth and hard food, and then had a great silver vessel brought and strained the honeycomb. The same man also brought a pot of curds as a present, poured the curds also into the vessel, mixed them with the honey, and offered the food to the Buddha and to the Congregation of Monks over which he presided. All took as much as they required and there was more than enough for all.*";
P_HTM[2235]="***(We must not ask ourselves the question, “How was it that so little food sufficed for so many?” For this was brought about by the supernatural power of the Buddha; and the power of a Buddha is inconceivable. “He who ponders the Four Inconceivables will go mad.”)*";
P_HTM[2236]="***Having wrought a good work so slight, the countryman was reborn, when the term of life allotted to him had come to an end, in the World of the Gods. After passing through the round of existence for a very long period of time, he passed at length from the World of the Gods and was reborn as the Prince Royal of Benāres. On the death of the king his father, he succeeded to the throne. Straightway resolving, “I will take a certain city,” he invested the city and sent word to the citizens, “Give me battle or the kingdom.” They replied, “We will give neither battle nor the kingdom.” So saying, they went forth from the lesser gates, procured firewood, water, and so forth, and did all that was necessary to maintain a defense. The king guarded the four principal gates and besieged the city for seven months and seven years.*";
P_HTM[2237]="***Now his mother asked what her son was doing, and on learning the facts, said, “My son is a simpleton. Go tell him to close the lesser gates and blockade the city completely.” When the king received his mother’s message, he did as she told him to. The citizens were unable any longer to leave the city, and on the seventh day killed their own king and gave the kingdom to the hostile king. Because he committed this act, he was reborn at the end of his life in the Hell of Avīci. After suffering torment in this Hell until this great earth was elevated a league, because he closed the four lesser gates, he passed from that existence, was conceived in the womb of his mother, and remained in her womb for seven months and seven years, lying across the mouth of the womb for seven days. Thus, monks, through the demerit acquired by Sīvali in besieging the city at that time, he was tormented in Hell for so long a period; and because he closed the lesser gates, when he was conceived in the womb of his mother, he remained in her womb for so long a time; because he gave the fresh honey in alms, he reached the pinnacle of gain.*";
P_HTM[2238]="***Again another day the monks began a discussion. “How great was the novice’s gain! How great was the merit through which one man was able to erect for five hundred monks five hundred pinnacled residences!” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said to them, “Monks, my son is attached neither to good nor to evil; he has renounced both.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza in the Brāhmaṇa Vagga,*";
P_HTM[2239]="***412. Whosoever in this world has escaped from the bonds of good and of evil,*";
P_HTM[2240]="***Whosoever is free from sorrow, free from defilement, free from impurity, him I call a Brahman.*";

P_HTM[2242]="***99. Delightful are the woods...*";
P_HTM[2243]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain woman.*";
P_HTM[2244]="***We are told that a certain monk who lived by his alms-bowl, got a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher and retired to a dilapidated pleasure garden for the purpose of meditation. Now a certain courtezan made an assignation with a man, saying, “I will go to such and such a place and you meet me there.” The woman kept the assignation, but the man did not. For some time she watched in vain the path by which she expected him to come. Finally, disappointed at his failure to keep his assignation, she strolled hither and thither and went into the pleasure garden. There she saw the monk sitting cross-legged. Looking this way and that, and seeing no one else about, she said to herself, “Here is a man; I will throw his thoughts into confusion.” So standing in front of the monk, she took down her undergarment several times and put it on again, unloosened her hair and bound it up again, and clapped her hands and laughed. The Elder became excited; his whole body, in fact, was suffused with excitement. “What does this mean?” thought he.*";
P_HTM[2245]="***The Teacher considered within himself, “A monk obtained a Subject of Meditation from me and went forth to perform his meditations. How is he getting on?” Seeing that woman, and observing her evil conduct, and perceiving that her evil conduct was upsetting the Elder, still remaining seated in his Perfumed Chamber, he spoke as follows, “Monks, there is no delight where those abide who seek after their lusts. But where those abide who are free from passion, that place is full of delight.” So saying, he sent forth a radiant image of himself, and instructing the Elder in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2246]="***99. Delightful are the woods; where the man of the world finds no delight,*";
P_HTM[2247]="***There they that are free from passion find delight, not they that seek after their lusts.*";
P_HTM[2248]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza that Elder, seated as he was, attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";

P_HTM[2252]="***Better were a single sentence full of meaning, which if a man hear, he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2253]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Copper-tooth, a public executioner.*";
P_HTM[2254]="***We are told that five hundred thieves less one made a living by plundering villages and other acts of violence. Now a certain man with copper-colored teeth and tawny skin, his body covered with scars, came to them and said, “Let me also live with you.” They took him to the ringleader of the thieves, saying, “This man also wishes to live with us.” The ringleader of the thieves looked at the man and thought to himself, “This man’s nature is inordinately cruel. He is capable of cutting out the breast of his mother and eating it, or of drawing the blood from the throat of his father and drinking it.” Therefore he refused his request, saying, “It will not do for this man to live with us.”*";
P_HTM[2255]="***Although he had thus been refused admission to the band of thieves, he went and won the favor of a certain pupil of the ringleader by his courteous attentions to him. This pupil took the man with him, approached the ringleader of the thieves, and said to him, “Master, this man is a dutiful servant of ours; bestow your favor on him.” Having made this request, he turned the man over to the ringleader of the thieves.*";
P_HTM[2256]="***One day the citizens joined forces with the king’s men, captured those thieves, took them to court, and arraigned them before the lords of justice. The justices ordered their heads to be chopped off with an axe. “Who will put these men to death?” said the citizens. After a thorough search they were unable to find a single man who was willing to put them to death. Finally they said to the ringleader of the thieves, “You put these men to death, and we will spare your life and give you a rich reward besides. You kill them.” But because they had lived with him, he also was unwilling to put them to death. In like manner also all of the five hundred less one refused when asked. Last of all they asked that scarred, tawny, copper-tooth. “Yes, indeed,” said he, consenting. So he put to death all the thieves, and in return received his life and rich gifts besides.*";
P_HTM[2257]="***In like manner also they brought in five hundred thieves from the country to the south of the city and arraigned them before the justices. When the justices ordered their heads to be chopped off, they asked each thief, beginning with the ringleader, to put his companions to death, but found not a single one willing to act as executioner. Then they said, “The other day a certain man put five hundred thieves to death. Where is he?” “We saw him in such and such a place,” was the reply. So they summoned him and said to him, “Put these men to death, and you will receive a rich reward.” “Yes, indeed,” said he, consenting. So he put them all to death and received his reward.*";
P_HTM[2258]="***The citizens consulted together and said, “This is a most excellent man. We will make him permanent executioner of thieves.” So saying, they gave him the post. Later on, they brought in five hundred thieves also from the west and still later five hundred also from the north, and he put them all to death. Thus he put to death two thousand thieves brought in from each of the four cardinal points. As time went on, and one or two men were brought in each day, he put them all to death. For a period of fifty-five years he acted as public executioner.*";
P_HTM[2259]="***In old age he could no longer cut off a man’s head with a single blow, but was obliged to deliver two or three blows, causing much unnecessary suffering to the victims. The citizens thought to themselves, “We can get another executioner of thieves. This man subjects his victims to much unnecessary torture. Of what use is he any longer?” Accordingly they removed him from his office. During his term of office as executioner of thieves, he had been accustomed to receive four perquisites: old clothes for him to wear, milk-porridge made with fresh ghee for him to drink, jasmine flowers wherewith to deck himself, and perfumes wherewith to anoint himself. But these four perquisites he received no longer. On the day he was deposed from office, he gave orders that milk-porridge should be cooked for him. And taking with him old clothes and jasmine flowers and perfumes, he went to the river and bathed. Having so done, he put on the old clothes, decked himself with garlands, anointed his limbs, and went home and sat down. They set before him milk-porridge made with fresh ghee and water for rinsing the hands.*";
P_HTM[2260]="***At that moment Elder Sāriputta arose from a state of trance. Said he to himself, “Where ought I to go to-day?” Surveying his rounds for alms, he saw milk-porridge in the house of the former executioner. Considering within himself, “Will this man receive me kindly?” he became aware of the following, “This excellent man will receive me kindly and will thereby gain a rich reward.” So the Elder put on his robe, took his bowl, and showed himself at the door of the former executioner’s house.*";
P_HTM[2261]="***When the man saw the Elder, his heart was filled with joy. Thought he to himself, “For a long time I have acted as executioner of thieves, and many are the men I have put to death. Now milk-porridge has been prepared in my house, and the Elder has come and stands at my threshold. Now ought I to present alms to his reverence.” So he removed the porridge which had been set before him, approached the Elder, and paid obeisance to him. And escorting him into his house, he provided him with a seat, poured the milk-porridge into his bowl, spread fresh ghee thereon, and standing beside him, began to fan him.*";
P_HTM[2262]="***Now not for a long time had he tasted milk-porridge, and therefore desired greatly to drink thereof. The Elder, knowing his desire, said to him, “Lay disciple, drink your own porridge.” The man placed the fan in the hand of another and drank the porridge. The Elder said to the man who was fanning him, “Go fan the lay disciple instead.” So while he was being fanned, he filled his belly with porridge, and then went and resumed fanning the Elder. When the Elder had finished his meal, he took his bowl.*";
P_HTM[2263]="***When the Elder began the words of thanksgiving to his host, the man was not able to fix his mind on the Elder’s discourse. The Elder, observing this, said to him, “Lay disciple, why is it that you are not able to fix your mind on my discourse?” “Reverend Sir, for a long time I have done deeds of cruelty; I have put many men to death. It is because I keep recalling my own past deeds, that I am unable to fix my mind on your reverence’s discourse.” The Elder thought to himself, “I will play a trick on him.” So he said to the man, “But did you do this of your own free will, or were you made to do it by others?” “The king made me do it, Reverend Sir.” “If that is the case, lay disciple, what wrong did you do?” The bewildered disciple thought, “According to what the Elder says, I have done no wrong.” Said he to the Elder, “Very well, Reverend Sir, continue your discourse.”*";
P_HTM[2264]="***As the Elder pronounced the words of thanksgiving, the man’s mind became tranquil; and as he listened to the Law, he developed the quality of patience, and progressed in the direction of the Path of Conversion. When the Elder had completed the words of thanksgiving, he departed. The lay disciple accompanied him a little way and then turned back. As the lay disciple was returning, an ogress came along in the form of a cow, struck him with her shoulder, and killed him. So he died and was reborn in the World of the Tusita gods.*";
P_HTM[2265]="***The monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “He who was an executioner of thieves, he who for fifty-five years committed acts of cruelty, to-day was relieved of his office, to-day gave alms to the Elder, to-day met death. Where was he reborn?” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, he has been reborn in the World of the Tusita gods.” “What say you, Reverend Sir? he who killed men for so long a time has been reborn in the World of the Tusita gods?” “Yes, monks. A great and good spiritual counselor did he receive. He heard Sāriputta preach the Law, and profiting thereby, acquired knowledge. When he departed from this existence, he was reborn in the World of the Tusita gods.” So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2266]="***He who was executioner of thieves in the city listened to words well spoken.*";
P_HTM[2267]="***Gained patience accordingly, went to heaven, and is in joy.*";
P_HTM[2268]="***“Reverend Sir, there is no great power in words of thanksgiving, and this man had done much wrong. How could he gain Specific Attainment with so little?” The Teacher replied, “Monks, do not measure the Law I have preached as being little or much. One saying possessed of meaning is of surpassing merit.” So saying, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2269]="***100. Though a speech consist of a thousand words, if the sentences lack meaning,*";
P_HTM[2270]="***Better were a single sentence full of meaning, which if a man hear, he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2271]="*[82] 2. Bāhiyadārucīriyattheravatthu**2. Conversion of Bāhiya Dārucīriya*";
P_HTM[2272]="***101. Though a Stanza consist of a thousand words, if the sentences lack meaning,*";
P_HTM[2273]="***Better were a single sentence of a Stanza, which if a man hear he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2274]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Bāhiya Dārucīriya.*";
P_HTM[2275]="***For once upon a time a party of men put to sea in a boat. When they were well out to sea, the boat sprang a leak. Thereupon all of the men, with a single exception, became food for fishes and tortoises. Only one man, who seized a plank and struggled with all his might, succeeded in reaching land near Suppāraka Port. When he came to land, he lacked both under and upper garments. So for lack of anything better, he wrapped himself with dry twigs and sticks and bark, and obtaining a potsherd from the royal household, went to Suppāraka Port. All who saw him gave him broth, rice-porridge and other kinds of food, and did reverence to him, saying, “This is some Arahat.”*";
P_HTM[2276]="***Thought he, “If I clothe myself in under and upper garments of fine texture, I shall no longer receive gain and honor.” Therefore he avoided such garments, using only the bark of trees to clothe himself withal. As many persons greeted him with the salutation “Arahat! Arahat!” the following consideration presented itself to his mind, “Am I perhaps one of those who are Arahats in this world, or who have entered the Path leading to Arahatship?” Thereupon a certain thought occurred to a deity who was a former blood-relative of his.*";
P_HTM[2277]="***2 a. Digression: Story of the Past*";
P_HTM[2278]="***By “former blood-relative” is meant one who formerly practiced meditation with him. It appears that in former times, when the religion of Kassapa Possessed of the Ten Forces was disappearing from the earth, seven monks, observing with regret a change for the worse in the conduct of probationers, novices, and others, said to themselves, “So long as our religion has not yet disappeared, we will make our own salvation sure.” So after reverencing their golden shrine, they entered the forest, and seeing a certain mountain, they said, “Let those who still cherish attachment for the life of this world turn back; let those who have rid themselves of attachment ascend this mountain.” Thereupon they set up a ladder, and all of them ascended the mountain, whereupon they kicked the ladder down and devoted themselves to meditation. After but a single night had passed, one of them, the Elder of the Assembly, attained Arahatship.*";
P_HTM[2279]="***The Elder of the Assembly chewed a toothstick of betel at Lake Anotatta, rinsed his mouth, brought food from North Kuru and said to those monks, “Brethren, chew this toothstick, rinse your mouths, and then eat this food.” But this they refused to do, saying, “But, Reverend Sir, did we make the following agreement, ‘All shall eat the food brought by him who first attains Arahatship’?” “We made no such agreement, brethren.” “Well then, if, like you, we also develop Specific Attainment, we will bring food for ourselves and eat it.” On the second day the Second Elder attained the Fruit of the Third Path, whereupon he likewise brought food to the monks and invited them to eat it. But they said, “But, Reverend Sir, did we agree not to eat the food brought by the Chief Elder, but to eat that which should be brought by a subordinate Elder?” “We did not so agree, brethren.” “In that case, if, like you, we also develop Specific Attainment, we shall be able by our own unaided efforts to provide ourselves with food, and we shall so provide ourselves with food.” Thus did they refuse to eat the food he had brought.*";
P_HTM[2280]="***Of the seven monks, the Elder of the Assembly who had attained Arahatship passed into Nibbāna, he who had attained the Fruit of the Third Path was reborn in the Brahmā world, and the remaining five, unable to develop Specific Attainment, wasted and withered away, died on the seventh day, and were reborn in the World of the Gods. In the period of this present Buddha they passed from that state of existence, and were reborn in various households. One of them was King Pukkusāti, one was Kumāra Kassapa, one was Dārucīriya, one was Dabba the Malla, and one was the monk Sabhiya. The term “former blood-relative” therefore refers to the monk who was reborn in the Brahmā world.*";
P_HTM[2281]="***2. Conversion of Bāhiya Dārucīriya, concluded*";
P_HTM[2282]="***To this denizen of the Brahmā world, then, occurred the following thought, “This man was associated with me in setting up the ladder and in the ascent of the mountain and in the practice of meditation; but now he has adopted false views, and by his present course of conduct he is in danger of perdition; I will stir him up.” Accordingly he approached him and spoke thus, “Bāhiya, you are not an Arahat, nor have you entered the Path that leads to Arahatship; moreover the course that you have adopted is not such that you will thereby attain Arahatship or enter the Path that leads to Arahatship.” As Mahā Brahmā, poised in the air, spoke these words, Bāhiya looked upon him and thought to himself, “Oh, what a plight I am in! I thought to myself, ‘I am an Arahat;’ but yonder spirit says to me, ‘You are not an Arahat, nor have you entered the Path that leads to Arahatship.’ Is there perhaps any other Arahat in the world?”*";
P_HTM[2283]="***Accordingly Bāhiya asked the spirit, “Deity, are there perhaps now in the world Arahats or those who have entered the Path leading to Arahatship?” Then the deity informed him as follows, “Bāhiya, there lies to the north a city named Sāvatthi; and there, at the present time, dwells he that is the Exalted One, the Arahat of Arahats, the Supremely Enlightened; and he that is the Exalted One, the Arahat of Arahats, preaches the Truth of Arahatship.”*";
P_HTM[2284]="***As Bāhiya listened in the night time to the speech of the deity, he became greatly agitated in mind; and instantly departing from Suppāraka, in the space of one night he arrived at Sāvatthi. The entire distance of a hundred and twenty leagues he traveled in the space of one night; but when he went thus, he went by the supernatural power of the deity. (Others would say, “by the supernatural power of the Buddha.”) At the moment when he arrived, the Teacher had entered the city for alms. When Bāhiya had breakfasted, he observed many monks taking their exercise in the open air by walking up and down, and he asked them, “Where is the Teacher now?” Said the monks, “He has just entered Sāvatthi for alms.” Then the monks asked Bāhiya, “But whence have you come?” “I have come from Suppāraka.” “When did you leave Suppāraka?” “Yesterday evening.” “You have come a long way. Just sit down, bathe your feet, anoint them with oil, and rest yourself a while. When the Teacher returns you will see him.” “Reverend Sir, I know not when the Teacher may die, or when I may die myself. I came here in the space of but a single night, neither stopping nor sitting down anywhere to rest. I have come a journey of a hundred and twenty leagues. So soon as I have seen the Teacher, I will rest myself.”*";
P_HTM[2285]="***When he had thus spoken, his body all of a tremble, he entered Sāvatthi and beheld the Exalted One making his round for alms with the incomparable grace of a Buddha. Said he to himself, “It is a long time indeed since I have seen Gotama the Supremely Enlightened.” And from the point where he had first seen him, he proceeded with his body inclined in an attitude of profound reverence; even as he stood in the street, he paid obeisance to him with the Five Rests, and took him firmly by the ankles, and spoke thus to him, “Let the Exalted One teach me the Law; let the Happy One teach me the Law, that it may avail for a long time to come to my welfare and salvation.”*";
P_HTM[2286]="***But the Teacher turned him away, saying, “You come out of due season, Bāhiya; I have entered among the houses for alms.” When Bāhiya heard these words, he said, “Reverend Sir, as I have passed through the round of existences, I have not before received material food. I know not the hour when you or I shall die: teach me the Law.” But the Teacher turned him away the second time as before. (This, we are told, was the thought that occurred to him, “From the time this man first saw me, his whole body has been suffused with joy; from the great shock of joy he has received, though he should listen to the Law, he would not be able to comprehend it; let him remain for a time in a state of placid equanimity. Moreover, by reason of the fact that he has come a journey of a hundred and twenty leagues in but a single night, his weariness is great; just let this subside.”) Therefore did the Teacher turn him away twice. When Bāhiya put his request the third time, the Teacher, remaining where he was in the street, said to him:*";
P_HTM[2287]="***“Therefore, Bāhiya, thus you must learn: In the seen, there can be only what is seen; in the heard, there can be only what is heard; in the thought, there can be only what is thought; in the known, there can be only what is known. For, Bāhiya, thus you must learn: Since, Bāhiya, for you, in the seen there can be only what is seen, in the heard what is heard, in the thought what is thought, in the known what is known, therefore you, Bāhiya, are not here. Since you, Bāhiya, are not here, therefore you, Bāhiya, are neither in this world, nor in the next world, nor betwixt the two. This alone is the end of suffering.”*";
P_HTM[2288]="***Even as Bāhiya listened to the Teacher’s discourse, he threw off all the Depravities and obtained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. Straightway he asked the Teacher to admit him to the Order. Upon this the Teacher asked him, “Have you bowl and robe complete?” “I have not bowl and robe complete,” replied Bāhiya. Then said the Teacher to him, “Well then, seek bowl and robe.” So saying, the Teacher went his way.*";
P_HTM[2289]="***We are told that during the period of twenty thousand years during which Bāhiya practiced meditation, he never did a single monk the favor of presenting him with bowl and robe; but that he used to say, “A monk ought to provide himself with his own requisites without looking to another; he ought through his own unaided efforts to provide himself with food;” and that the Teacher, knowing this, and knowing that for this reason he would not obtain bowl and robe created by supernatural power, did not admit him to the Order with the usual formula, “Come, monk!”*";
P_HTM[2290]="***As Bāhiya was seeking bowl and robe, a certain ogress in the form of a heifer approached, struck him with her left shoulder, and deprived him of life. The Teacher, after making his round for alms and after eating his breakfast, came forth with a large company of monks, and saw the body of Bāhiya lying prostrate on the dust-heap. Straightway he commanded the monks as follows, “Monks, bring a litter which stands at the door of a certain house, carry the body of this man out of the city, burn it, and erect a mound over the remains.” The monks did so, and having so done, returned to the monastery, approached the Teacher, told him what they had done, and inquired about the future state of the dead man.*";
P_HTM[2291]="***Thereupon the Teacher announced that he had passed into Nibbāna, and assigned him preëminence, saying, “Monks, preëminent among my disciples and monks who are quick to learn the truth is Bāhiya Dārucīriya.” Then the monks asked him, “Reverend Sir, you say, ‘Bāhiya Dārucīriya has attained Arahatship;’ when did he attain Arahatship?” “Monks, it was when he heard me preach the Law.” “But when did you preach the Law to him?” “While I was making my rounds for alms, standing in the middle of the street.” “Was not the discourse you delivered standing in the middle of the street an extremely short one, Reverend Sir? How was it that he developed Specific Attainment after hearing so very little?” Then said the Teacher to them, “Monks, do not measure my Law as being ‘little’ or ‘much.’ There is no virtue even in many thousands of Stanzas. A single sentence of a Stanza, which contains the truth, is better.” And when he had thus spoken, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2292]="***101. Though a Stanza consist of a thousand words, if the sentences lack meaning,*";
P_HTM[2293]="***Better were a single sentence of a Stanza, which if a man hear he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2294]="*[83] 3. Kuṇḍalakesittherīvatthu**3. The Maiden who Married a Thief*";
P_HTM[2295]="***102. Though one should recite a hundred Stanzas composed of meaningless sentences,*";
P_HTM[2296]="***Yet one Sentence of the Law were better, which if a man hear he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2297]="***103. Though one should conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle,*";
P_HTM[2298]="***Yet would he be the mightiest conqueror who should conquer one, himself.*";
P_HTM[2299]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana concerning Kuṇḍalakesī.*";
P_HTM[2300]="***A rich merchant of Rājagaha, it seems, had an only daughter who was about sixteen years of age, and she was exceedingly beautiful and fair to see. (When women reach this age, they burn and long for men.) Her mother and father lodged her on the topmost floor of a seven-storied palace in an apartment of royal splendor, and gave her only a single slave-woman to wait upon her.*";
P_HTM[2301]="***Now one day a young man of station was caught in the act of robbery. They bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution, scourging him with lashes at every cross-roads. The merchant’s daughter heard the shouts of the crowd, said to herself, “What is that?” looked down from the top of the palace, and saw him.*";
P_HTM[2302]="***Straightway she fell in love with him. So great, in fact, was her longing for him that she took to her bed and refused to eat. Her mother asked her, “What does this mean, my dear daughter?” “If I can have that young man who was caught in the act of committing robbery and who was led through the streets, life will be worth living; if not, life is not worth living; I shall die here and now.” “Do not act in this manner, my dear daughter; you shall have some one else for your husband, some one who is our equal in birth and family and wealth.” “I will have no one else; if I cannot have this man I shall die.”*";
P_HTM[2303]="***The mother, unable to pacify her daughter, told the father; but the father likewise was unable to pacify his daughter. “What is to be done?” thought he. He sent a thousand pieces of money to the king’s officer who had captured the robber and who was accompanying him to the place of execution, saying, “Take this money and send the robber to me.” “Very well!” said the king’s officer. He took the money, released the robber, had another man put to death, and sent word to the king, “The robber has been executed, your majesty.”*";
P_HTM[2304]="***The merchant gave his daughter in marriage to the robber. She resolved to win the favor of her husband; and from that time on, adorned with all her adornments, she prepared her husband’s meals with her own hand. After a few days the robber thought to himself, “When can I kill this woman, take her jewels and sell them, and so be able to take my meals in a certain tavern? This is the way!”*";
P_HTM[2305]="***He took to his bed and refused to eat. She came to him and asked, “Are you in pain?” “Not at all, wife.” “Then perhaps my mother and father are angry with you?” “They are not angry with me, wife.” “What is the matter, then?” “Wife, that day when I was bound and led through the streets, I saved my life by vowing an offering to the deity that lives on Robbers’ Cliff; likewise it was through his supernatural power that I gained you for my wife. I was wondering how I could fulfill my vow of an offering to the deity.” “Husband, do not worry; I will see to the offering; tell me what is needed.” “Rich rice-porridge, flavored with honey; and the five kinds of flowers, including the lāja flower.” “Very well, husband, I will make ready the offering.”*";
P_HTM[2306]="***Having prepared the whole offering, she said to her husband, “Come, husband, let us go.” “Very well, wife; let your kinsmen re-main behind; put on your costly garments and adorn yourself with your precious jewels, and we will go gayly, laughing and disporting ourselves.” She did as she was told. When they reached the foot of the mountain, the robber said to her, “Wife, from this point on let us two go alone; we will send back the rest of the company in a conveyance; you take the vessel containing the offering and carry it yourself.” She did as she was told.*";
P_HTM[2307]="***The robber took her in his arms and climbed the mountain to the top of Robbers’ Cliff. (One side of this mountain men can climb; but the other side is a precipitous cliff, from the top of which robbers are flung, being dashed to pieces before they reach the bottom; therefore it is called “Robbers’ Cliff.”) Standing on the top of the mountain, she said, “Husband, present the offering.” Her husband made no reply. Again she spoke, “Husband, why do you remain silent?” Then he said to her, “I have no use for the offering; I deceived you in bringing you here with an offering.” “Then why did you bring me here, husband?” “To kill you, seize your jewels, and escape.” Terrified with the fear of death, she said to him, “Husband, both my jewels and my person belong to you; why do you speak thus?” Over and over again she pleaded with him, “Do not do this;” but his only reply was, “I will kill you.” “After all, what will you gain by killing me? Take these jewels and spare my life; henceforth regard me as your mother, or else let me be your slave-woman and work for you.” So saying, she recited the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2308]="***Take these golden bracelets, all set with beryls.*";
P_HTM[2309]="***Take all, and welcome; call me your slave-woman.*";
P_HTM[2310]="***The robber, hearing this, said to her, “Despite what you say, were I to spare your life, you would go and tell your mother and father all. I will kill you. That is all. Lament not with vehement lamentation.” So saying, he recited the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2311]="***Lament not overmuch; tie up your possessions quickly.*";
P_HTM[2312]="***You have not long to live; I shall take all your possessions.*";
P_HTM[2313]="***She thought to herself, “Oh, what a wicked deed is this! However, wisdom was not made to be cooked and eaten, but rather to make men look before they leap. I shall find a way of dealing with him.” And she said to him, “Husband, when they caught you in the act of committing robbery and led you through the streets, I told my mother and father, and they spent a thousand pieces of money in ransoming you, and they gave you a place in their house, and from that time on I have been your benefactress; to-day do me the favor of letting me pay obeisance to you.” “Very well, wife,” said he, granted her the favor of paying obeisance to him, and then took his stand near the edge of the cliff.*";
P_HTM[2314]="***She walked around him three times, keeping him on her right hand, and paid obeisance to him in the four places. Then she said to him, “Husband, this is the last time I shall see you. Henceforth you will see me no more, neither shall I see you any more.” And she embraced him both before and behind. Then, remaining behind him, as he stood off his guard near the edge of the cliff, she put one hand to his shoulder and the other to the small of his back, and flung him over the cliff. Thus was the robber hurled into the abyss of the mountain, and dashed to pieces when he reached the bottom. The deity that dwelt on the top of Robbers’ Cliff observed the actions of the two, and applauding the woman, uttered the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2315]="***Wisdom is not always confined to men;*";
P_HTM[2316]="***A woman, too, is wise, and shows it now and then.*";
P_HTM[2317]="***Having thrown the robber over the cliff, the woman thought to herself, “If I go home, they will ask me, ‘Where is your husband?’ and if, in answer to their question, I say, ‘I have killed him,’ they will pierce me with the knives of their tongues, saying, ‘We ransomed the scoundrel with a thousand pieces of money and now you have killed him.’ If, on the other hand, I say, ‘He sought to kill me for my jewels,’ they will not believe me. I’m done with home!” She cast off her jewels, went into the forest, and after wandering about for a time came to a certain hermitage of nuns. She reverently bowed and said, “Sister, receive me into your Order as a nun.” So they received her as a nun.*";
P_HTM[2318]="***After she had become a nun, she asked, “Sister, what is the goal of your Religious Life?” “Sister, the development of spiritual ecstasy through the employment of the ten Kasiṇas, or else the memorizing of a thousand articles of faith; this is the highest aim of our Religious Life.” “Spiritual ecstasy I shall not be able to develop. Reverend Sister; but I will master the thousand articles of faith.” When she had mastered the thousand articles of faith, they said to her, “You have acquired proficiency; now go throughout the length and breadth of the Land of the Rose-Apple and look for some one able to match question and answer with you.”*";
P_HTM[2319]="***So, placing a branch of rose-apple in her hands, they dismissed her with these words, “Go forth, sister; if any one who is a layman is able to match question and answer with you, become his slave; if any monk, enter his Order as a nun.” Adopting the name “Nun of the Rose-Apple,” she left the hermitage and went about from place to place asking questions of everyone she saw. No one was able to match question and answer with her; in fact, such a reputation did she acquire that whenever men heard the announcement, “Here comes the ‘Nun of the Rose-Apple,’ ” they would run away.*";
P_HTM[2320]="***Before entering a town or village for alms, she would scrape a pile of sand together before the village gate and there plant her rose-apple branch. Then she would issue her challenge, “Let him that is able to match question and answer with me trample this rose-apple branch under his feet.” So saying, she would enter the village. No one dared to pass beyond that spot. When one branch withered, she would procure a fresh one.*";
P_HTM[2321]="***Traveling about in this way, she arrived at Sāvatthi, planted the branch before the city gate, issued her challenge in the usual way, and went in to seek alms. A number of young boys gathered about the branch and waited to see what would happen. Just then the Elder Sāriputta, who had made his round and eaten his breakfast and was on his way out of the city, saw those boys standing about the branch and asked them, “What does this mean?” The boys explained matters to the Elder. Said the Elder, “Go ahead, boys, trample that branch under your feet.” “We are afraid to, Reverend Sir.” “I will answer the question; you go ahead and trample the branch under your feet.” The Elder’s words supplied the boys with the necessary courage. Forthwith they trampled the branch under their feet, shouting and kicking up the dust.*";
P_HTM[2322]="***When the nun returned, she rebuked them and said, “I don’t intend to bandy question and answer with you; how did you come to trample the branch under your feet?” “Our noble Elder told us to.” “Reverend Sir, did you tell them to trample my branch under their feet?” “Yes, sister.” “Well then, match question and answer with me.” “Very well, I will do so.”*";
P_HTM[2323]="***As the shades of evening drew on, she went to the Elder’s residence to put her questions. The entire city was stirred up. The people said to each other, “Let us go and hear the talk of the two learned persons.” Accompanying the nun from the city to the Elder’s residence, they bowed to the Elder and seated themselves respectfully on one side.*";
P_HTM[2324]="***The nun said to the Elder, “Reverend Sir, I wish to ask you a question.” “Ask it, sister.” So she asked him the thousand articles of faith. Every question the nun asked, the Elder answered correctly. Then he said to her, “You have asked only these few questions; are there any others?” “These are all, Reverend Sir.” “You have asked many questions; I will ask you just one; will you answer me?” “Ask your question, Reverend Sir.” Then the Elder asked her the following question, “What is ‘One’?” She said to herself, “This is a question I should be able to answer;” but not knowing the answer, she inquired of the Elder, “What is it, Reverend Sir?” “That is the Buddha’s question, sister.” “Tell me also the answer, Reverend Sir.” “If you will enter our Order, I will tell you the answer.” “Very well, admit me to the Order.” The Elder sent word to the nuns and had her admitted. After being admitted to the Order, she made her full profession, took the name Kuṇḍalakesī, and after a few days became an Arahat endowed with the Supernatural Faculties.*";
P_HTM[2325]="***In the Hall of Truth the monks began a discussion of the incident. “Kuṇḍalakesī heard little of the Law and yet she succeeded in being admitted to the Order; moreover, she came here after fighting a fierce battle with a robber and defeating him.” The Teacher came in and asked them, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here discussing now?” They told him, “Monks, measure not the Law I have taught as being ‘little’ or ‘much.’ There is no superior merit in a hundred sentences that are meaningless; but one Sentence of the Law is better. He that defeats all other robbers wins no victory at all, but he who defeats the robbers that are his own Depravities, his is victory indeed.” Then he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2326]="***102. Though one should recite a hundred Stanzas composed of meaningless sentences,*";
P_HTM[2327]="***Yet one Sentence of the Law were better, which if a man hear he is at peace.*";
P_HTM[2328]="***103. Though one should conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle,*";
P_HTM[2329]="***Yet would he be the mightiest conqueror who should conquer one, himself.*";
P_HTM[2330]="*[84] 4. Anatthapucchakabrāhmaṇavatthu**4. Gain and Loss*";
P_HTM[2331]="***104. Victory over self is better...*";
P_HTM[2332]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a Brahman who asked about gain and loss.*";
P_HTM[2333]="***The story goes that this Brahman considered within himself, “Does the Supremely Enlightened know gain alone or does he know loss also? I will ask him.” Accordingly he approached the Teacher and asked him, “Reverend Sir, tell me, I pray you, do you know gain alone, and not loss?” “Brahman, I know both gain and loss.” “Well then, tell me about loss.” At once the Teacher pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2334]="***Unprofitable is sleeping after sunrise, idleness, the moonlight, long-continued prosperity,*";
P_HTM[2335]="***Going on journeys, seeking after other men’s wives.*";
P_HTM[2336]="***Seek after these things, Brahman, and you will gain that which will be of no advantage to you.*";
P_HTM[2337]="***When the Brahman heard this, he applauded the Teacher, saying, “Well said, well said, teacher of the multitude, leader of the multitude! You know indeed both gain and loss.” “Indeed, Brahman, there is none other that knows loss so well as I.” Then the Teacher considered within himself what motive actuated the Brahman, and asked him, “Brahman, how do you make your living?” “By gambling, Sir Gotama.” “But which wins, you or the other man?” “Sometimes I win and sometimes the other man wins.” Then said the Teacher, “Brahman, a trifling matter is the victory of him who defeats another; there is no superior advantage in such a victory. But he who overcomes his Depravities and so conquers self, wins a better victory, for such a victory no one can turn into defeat.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2338]="***104. Victory over self is better than victory over all other folk besides;*";
P_HTM[2339]="***If a man conquer self, and live always under restraint,*";
P_HTM[2340]="***105. Neither god nor gandhabba nor Māra with Brahmā united,*";
P_HTM[2341]="***Can turn into defeat the victory of such a man.*";
P_HTM[2342]="*[85] 5. Sāriputtattherassa mātulabrāhmaṇavatthu**5. Sāriputta’s Uncle*";
P_HTM[2343]="***106. Though a man, month after month...*";
P_HTM[2344]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Sāriputta’s uncle.*";
P_HTM[2345]="***The story goes that Elder Sāriputta once went to his uncle and said, “Brahman, do you ever do a single good deed?” “I do, Reverend Sir.” “What do you do?” “Month after month, I give alms to the value of a thousand pieces of money.” “To whom do you give this money?” “To the Naked Ascetics, Reverend Sir.” “And what do you hope to gain thereby?” “I hope to gain the World of Brahmā.” “But is this the way to reach the World of Brahmā?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “Who told you so?” “My teachers told me so, Reverend Sir.” “Brahman, neither you nor your teachers know the way to the World of Brahmā. The Teacher alone knows the way thereto. Come with me, and I will ask him to tell you the way to the World of Brahmā.”*";
P_HTM[2346]="***So Elder Sāriputta took his uncle with him, went to the Teacher, and told him all about it, saying, “Reverend Sir, this Brahman said so and so. Be so good as to tell him the way to the World of Brahmā.” The Teacher asked, “Brahman, are you correctly reported?” “Yes, Sir Gotama.” “Brahman, though you should give alms in this way for a hundred years, yet were it far more fruitful for a man, with believing heart, for but a single instant to look upon my disciple or to bestow upon him a mere spoonful of boiled rice.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2347]="***106. Though a man, month after month, for a hundred years, should sacrifice a thousand pieces of money,*";
P_HTM[2348]="***Yet, should he honor for even a single instant a man who has trained himself,*";
P_HTM[2349]="***It were better for him so to render honor than to offer sacrifice for a hundred years.*";
P_HTM[2350]="*[86] 6. Sāriputtattherassa bhāgineyyavatthu**6. Sāriputta’s Nephew*";
P_HTM[2351]="***107. Though a man for a hundred years...*";
P_HTM[2352]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Sāriputta’s nephew.*";
P_HTM[2353]="***For the Elder went to his nephew also and said, “Brahman, do you ever do a single good deed?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “What do you do?” “Month after month, I slay a single beast and tend the sacrificial fire.” “For what purpose do you do that?” “That, they say, is the way to the World of Brahmā.” “Who told you so?” “My teachers, Reverend Sir.” “Neither you nor your teachers know the way to the World of Brahmā. Come, let us go to the Teacher.”*";
P_HTM[2354]="***So Elder Sāriputta conducted his nephew to the Teacher, informed the Teacher of the incident, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, tell this man the way to the World of Brahmā.” Said the Teacher, “Brahman, are you correctly reported?” “Yes, Sir Gotama.” “Brahman, though you should thus tend the sacrificial fire for a hundred years, yet would the merit of your performance not attain the worth of honor done to my disciple for even a single instant.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2355]="***107. Though a man for a hundred years should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest,*";
P_HTM[2356]="***Yet, should he honor for even a single instant a man who has trained himself,*";

P_HTM[2360]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Sāriputta’s friend.*";
P_HTM[2361]="***The Elder approached him also and asked him, “Brahman, do you ever do a single good deed?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” “What do you do?” “I offer sacrificial slaughter.” (At that time, we are told, it was the custom to offer sacrificial slaughter at an expenditure of immense sums of money.) The Elder, after questioning his companion in the manner related above, conducted him to the Teacher, informed him of the incident, and said to him, “Reverend Sir, tell this man the way to the World of Brahmā.” The Teacher asked him, “Brahman, are you correctly reported?” “Yes,” replied the Brahman. “Brahman, though you should offer sacrificial slaughter for a year, yet would your act not be worth the fourth part of the act of him who, with believing heart, bestows alms on the populace, or of those who, with good intention, render homage to my disciples.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2362]="***108. Whatsoever, either by way of sacrificial slaughter or by way of oblation,*";
P_HTM[2363]="***Though it be for a year, a man sacrifice, desiring merit,*";

P_HTM[2368]="***Four things increase for him: age, beauty, happiness, power.*";
P_HTM[2369]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Araññakuṭikā near Dīghalambika with reference to the youth Dīghāyu.*";
P_HTM[2370]="***The story goes that two Brahmans, residents of the city of Dīghalambika, retired from the world, became members of an heretical order, and for forty-eight years performed religious austerities. Finally one of them thought, “My line will perish; I will therefore return to the world.” Accordingly he sold to others the merit of the austerities he had performed, and with a hundred cattle and a hundred pieces of money procured him a wife and set up a household. After a time his wife gave birth to a son.*";
P_HTM[2371]="***Now the other monk, his former companion, after visiting foreign parts, returned once more to that city. Hearing that he had returned, the layman took son and wife and went to see him. When he met him, he placed his son in the arms of the mother, and himself saluted the monk. Then the mother placed the child in the arms of the father and saluted the monk. “Live long!” said the monk to them. But when the son was made to salute him, he held his peace.*";
P_HTM[2372]="***Said the father, “Reverend Sir, why was it that when we saluted you, you said, ‘Live long!’ but when this boy saluted you, you said not a word?” “Some disaster awaits this boy, Brahman.” “How long will he live, Reverend Sir?” “For seven days, Brahman.” “Is there any way of averting this, Reverend Sir?” “I know of no way of averting this.” “But who might know, Reverend Sir?” “The monk Gotama; go to him and ask him.” “Were I to go there, I should be afraid because of having abandoned my austerities.” “If you love your son, think not of having abandoned your austerities, but go to him and ask him.”*";
P_HTM[2373]="***The Brahman went to the Teacher, and himself straightway saluted him. “Live long!” said the Teacher. When the boy’s mother saluted him, he said the same. But when they made the boy salute him, he held his peace. Then the Brahman asked the Teacher the same question he had previously asked the monk, and the Teacher made the same prediction. We are told that this Brahman, not having attained omniscience, united his own wisdom with omniscience, but for all that discovered no way of averting his son’s fate. The Brahman asked the Teacher, “Reverend Sir, is there no way of averting this?” “There might be, Brahman.” “What way might there be, Reverend Sir?”*";
P_HTM[2374]="***“If you erect a pavilion before the door of your house, and set a chair in the center of it, and arrange eight or sixteen seats in a circle about it, and cause my disciples to sit therein; and if you then cause texts to be recited for the purpose of securing protection and averting evil consequences for the space of seven days uninterruptedly, in that case the danger that threatens him might be averted.” “Sir Gotama, it is a perfectly easy matter to erect a pavilion and do all the rest, but how am I to obtain the services of your disciples?” “If you will do all this, I will send my disciples.” “Very well, Sir Gotama.”*";
P_HTM[2375]="***So the Brahman completed all of the preparations at the door of his house and then went to the Teacher. The Teacher sent the monks, and they went there and sat down, seating the boy also on a little bench. For seven nights and seven days without interruption, the monks recited the usual texts, and on the seventh day the Teacher came himself. When the Teacher came, the deities of all the worlds assembled. But a certain ogre named Avaruddhaka, who had served Vessavaṇa for twelve years and who had received the boon, “Seven days hence you shall receive this boy,” approached and stood waiting. But when the Teacher came there, and the powerful deities gathered themselves together, and the weak deities drew back, stepping back twelve leagues so as to make room, then Avaruddhaka stepped back also.*";
P_HTM[2376]="***The Teacher recited the Protective Texts all night long, with the result that when the seven days had elapsed, Avaruddhaka failed to get the boy. Indeed, when the dawn of the eighth day rose, they brought the boy and caused him to make obeisance to the Teacher. Said the Teacher, “Live long!” “Sir Gotama, how long will the boy live?” “For a hundred and twenty years, Brahman.” So they gave him the name of Lad-whose-years-increased, Āyuvaḍḍhana. When the youth grew up, he went about surrounded by five hundred lay disciples.*";
P_HTM[2377]="***One day the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth: “Just think, brethren! The youth Āyuvaḍḍhana would have died on the seventh day, but now he is destined to live for a hundred and twenty years. There he goes, surrounded by five hundred lay disciples. There must therefore be some reason why the term of life of living beings here in the world increases.” The Teacher approached and asked them, “Monks, what are you sitting here now talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, it is not a matter of years alone. Living beings here in the world who respect and reverence the virtuous, increase in four matters, obtain release from danger, and abide in safety unto the end of their days.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2378]="***109. If a man have the habit of reverence, if he alway respect the aged,*";
P_HTM[2379]="***Four things increase for him: age, beauty, happiness, power.*";
P_HTM[2380]="*[89] 9. Saṃkiccasāmaṇeravatthu**9. Saṁkicca the Novice*";
P_HTM[2381]="***110. Though one should live a hundred years, corrupt, not meditating,*";
P_HTM[2382]="***Yet were it better to live a single day in the practice of virtue, in meditation.*";
P_HTM[2383]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the novice Saṁkicca.*";
P_HTM[2384]="***The story goes that thirty men of respectable families living at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher preach the Law, yielded the breast to his teaching, and became monks. Five years after their full profession, they approached the Teacher, and listened to his exposition of the Two Burdens; namely, the Burden of Study and the Burden of Meditation. Concluding that because they had become monks in old age, it would be impossible for them to fulfil the Burden of Study, but desiring to fulfill the Burden of Meditation, they had the Teacher assign them a Formula of Meditation leading to Arahatship, and requested his permission to go to a certain retreat in the forest. The Teacher asked them to what place they wished to go. When they told him, he thought to himself, “They will be in danger of harm there through a certain eater of broken meats. But if the novice Saṁkicca accompanies them, the danger will be removed, and they will reach the goal of their Religious Life.”*";
P_HTM[2385]="***The novice Saṁkicca was the novice of the Elder Sāriputta and was but seven years old. As for his birth, his mother was the daughter of a rich man of Sāvatthi, and while he yet remained in the womb, his mother died suddenly of a certain disease. When her body was burned, all of her flesh was burned with it, save only the flesh of her unborn child. In taking the unborn child from the pyre, the sticks that they used pierced the flesh in two or three places, and the sharp point of one stick hit the pupil of the boy’s eye. Having thus pierced the flesh of the unborn child, they threw his body on the heap of coals, covered it entirely with coals, and went their way. The flesh of the child was burned away, but on the summit of the heap of coals there appeared, sitting as it were in the calyx of a lotus-flower, a little boy who looked like a golden image. For he was in his last existence before attaining Nibbāna, and since he had not yet attained Arahatship, nothing could have destroyed him, not even had Mount Sineru fallen upon him to crush him.*";
P_HTM[2386]="***When they went the next day to extinguish the pile, and saw the child lying there in such wise, they were filled with wonder and amazement. And they said to themselves, “How did it happen that with all these sticks of wood aflame, and his whole body on fire, this child was not burned to death? What does this portend?” So they carried the child into the village and consulted the fortune-tellers. The fortune-tellers said, “If this child lives the life of a householder, his kinsfolk will not be poor for seven generations. If he becomes a monk, he will go about with a retinue of five hundred monks.” Because the pupil of his eye had been pierced with a stick (saṁku), they gave him the name Saṁkicca; and from that time forth he bore the name Saṁkicca. His kinsfolk reared him with the thought in their minds, “Let be! when he has grown up we will have our noble Elder make a monk of him.”*";
P_HTM[2387]="***When he was seven years old, he heard his boy-companions say, “Your mother died while you were still in her womb. Although her body was burned on the pile, nevertheless you yourself were not burned.” Thereupon he said to his kinsfolk, “My companions tell me that I was saved from so terrible a danger as that; why should I live the life of a householder? I will become a monk.” “Very well, dear child,” said they, and taking the boy to the Elder Sāriputta, they committed him to his care, saying, “Reverend Sir, receive this child into the Order.” The Elder taught him the Formula of Meditation, consisting of the first five of the constituent parts of the body, and received him into the Order. The moment the razor touched his hair, he attained Arahatship. This was the novice Saṁkicca.*";
P_HTM[2388]="***The Teacher, knowing within himself, “If this novice goes with them, this danger will be removed, and they will reach the goal of their Religious Life,” said to them, “Monks, see your older brother the Elder Sāriputta before you go.” “Very well,” said they, and straightway went to the Elder. “What is it, brethren?” said he. They replied, “We have received our Formula of Meditation from the Teacher, and asked his permission to go to the forest. But he said to us, ‘See your older brother before you go;’ therefore we have come here.” The Elder thought to himself, “The Teacher must have had some reason for sending these monks here; what can it be?” Having considered the matter, he became aware of the reason; whereupon he said to them, “Is the novice with you?” “Nay, brother, he is not.” “In that case get the novice Saṁkicca and take him with you.” “Nay, brother, the novice will be a hindrance to us. Of what use will the novice be to us during our residence in the forest?” “You are mistaken, brethren. The novice will not be a hindrance to you. On the contrary, you will be a hindrance to him. The Teacher sent you to me because he wished the novice to accompany you. Therefore take him with you when you go.”*";
P_HTM[2389]="***“Very well,” said they, consenting. So they took the novice with them, and, thirty-one in number, they bade farewell to the Elder and departed from the monastery. They traveled from place to place, and after making a journey of a hundred and twenty leagues, they came to a village in which dwelt a thousand families. When the inhabitants saw them, their hearts were filled with joy. After ministering faithfully to their needs, they asked them, “Reverend Sirs, where do you intend to go?” “To a comfortable lodging, brethren,” said the monks. Thereupon the inhabitants prostrated themselves before their feet and begged them to remain, saying, “Reverend Sirs, if you will take up your residence near this place for the season of the rains, we will take upon ourselves the Five Precepts and perform the Fast-Day Duties.”*";
P_HTM[2390]="***The Elders accepted the invitation. Thereupon the inhabitants arranged for them night-quarters and day-quarters, covered walks, and huts of leaves and grass. And distributing the duties day by day among the several groups, so that each might do his share and none be overburdened, they ministered faithfully to their needs. On the day when they entered upon residence for the rainy season, the Elders came to the following agreement, “Brethren, we have received our Formula of Meditation from the living Buddha; and it is impossible to win the favor of the Buddhas otherwise than by the faithful performance of religious duties. Now the doors of the states of suffering stand open before us; therefore with the exception of the early morning, when we go the round for alms, and of the evening, when we wait upon the Elder, at no time other than these two, may two of us be together. If any one fall sick, let him strike upon a bell and we will go to him and provide him with medicine. From this time forth, at whatsoever time of the night or of the day it may be, let us apply ourselves diligently to our Formula of Meditation.” Having made this agreement, they entered upon residence.*";
P_HTM[2391]="***Now at this time a poor man who had been supported by one of his daughters, but who had been obliged to remove from his former place of residence on account of lack of food there, set out on a journey to obtain support from another daughter. On the same day the Elders, after making their round for alms in the village, returning to their place of residence, bathed in a certain river by the way, and sat down on a bed of sand to eat their meal.*";
P_HTM[2392]="***At that moment the poor man came to that place and stood respectfully on one side. “Whence do you come?” the Elders asked him. The poor man told his story. The Elders took pity on him and said, “Lay disciple, you seem to be very hungry. Go get a leaf, and each of us will give you a portion of rice.” When he brought the leaf, they mixed rice with sauce and curry, and each of them gave him a portion of the same kind of food they were themselves eating. For it is said, “Should a stranger come at meal-time and a monk offer him food, failing the best food, he should give him precisely the same kind of food he himself is eating, be it little or much.” Therefore did these monks also act accordingly.*";
P_HTM[2393]="***When he had finished his meal, he bowed to the Elders and asked, “Reverend Sirs, has any one invited you to a meal?” “We have received no invitation, lay disciple. From day to day men give us just this sort of food.” The poor man thought to himself, “Even were we up and doing every moment of the time, we could never obtain food like this. Why should I go elsewhere? I will live with these monks.” So he said to them, “I should like to live with you, performing the major and minor duties.” “Very well, lay disciple.” So he accompanied them to their place of residence, and by his faithful performance of the major and minor duties won their favor completely.*";
P_HTM[2394]="***When two months had passed, he desired to see his daughter. But because he thought that in case he asked permission of the monks they would not let him go, he decided to leave even without their permission. So he left without so much as asking their permission. This was the only gross breach of propriety he committed; namely, in leaving without obtaining permission of the monks.*";
P_HTM[2395]="***As he proceeded on his journey, he came to a certain forest. Now for seven days there had been living in this forest five hundred thieves, who had made the following vow to a spirit, “Whoever enters this forest, we will kill him and make an offering to you with his flesh and blood.” Therefore when the oldest thief climbed a tree on the seventh day to look for victims and saw the man coming, he gave a sign to the thieves; and as soon as they were sure that he was well within the forest, they surrounded him, seized him, and bound him fast. Then gathering a quantity of firewood and kindling a fire by attrition, they started a great bonfire and cut and sharpened wooden stakes.*";
P_HTM[2396]="***When he saw what they were doing, he said to the ringleader, “Master, I see no pigs right here, nor any other wild animals. Why are you making all these preparations?” “We intend to kill you and to make an offering to a spirit with your flesh and blood.” Terrified with the fear of death, he gave not a moment’s thought to the kind assistance he had received from the monks, but sought only to save his own life. Said he, “Master, I am only an eater of broken meats; that is to say, I have been brought up to eat only the remnants of food eaten by others. I am only an eater of broken meats, the very personification of adversity. But in such and such a place reside thirty-one monks, men of princely rank, worthy men who have retired from the world here and there. Kill them, make an offering with their blood, and your spirit will be pleased beyond measure.”*";
P_HTM[2397]="***When the thieves heard this, they thought to themselves, “This man makes a good suggestion. Of what use to us is this personification of adversity? Let us kill these men of princely rank and make an offering with their blood.” So they said to the man, “Go ahead and show us where they reside.” And taking him along as guide, they arrived at the place he mentioned. Seeing no monks within the monastery, they asked him, “Where are the monks?” The man, since he had lived with the monks for two months and knew all about the agreement they had made, replied as follows, “They are sitting in their night-quarters and in their day-quarters. Let someone strike the bell, and at the sound of the bell they will all assemble.”*";
P_HTM[2398]="***So the ringleader of the thieves struck the bell. When the monks heard the sound of the bell, they thought, “It is an unusual time for the bell to be struck. Who can be sick?” And coming to the monastery court, they sat down in order on the stone seats which had been placed there. The Elder of the Assembly looked at the thieves and asked, “Lay disciples, who struck this bell?” The ringleader of the thieves replied, “I did, Reverend Sir.” “For what reason?” “We made a vow to the forest-spirit, and wish to take one monk with us for the purpose of making an offering.”*";
P_HTM[2399]="***When the Chief Elder heard this, he said to the monks, “Brethren, when brothers undertake a duty, the final decision rests with the senior brother. Therefore I will surrender my life for your sake and go with these men.” And he added, “Let not death be the portion of all; perform your meditations with heedfulness.” The Junior Elder said, “Reverend Sir, the duty of the senior brother should be borne by the junior. I will go. Be heedful.” Likewise did all thirty monks rise in order and say, “Let none but me go.” Thus did they, although not the sons of the same mother or of the same father, because they were free from the Attachments, rise in order, and offer to surrender their lives for the sake of the rest. Not one was so cowardly as to say, “You go.”*";
P_HTM[2400]="***When the novice Saṁkicca heard them speak thus, he said, “Reverend Sirs, you remain here; I will surrender my life for you and go.” “Brother, even if we’re all murdered here together, we’ll not let you go alone.” “Why, Reverend Sir?” “Brother, you are the novice of the Elder Sāriputta, the Captain of the Faith. If we let you go, the Elder will blame us, saying, ‘They took my novice with them, and then went and handed him over to a pack of thieves;’ and we shall not be able to escape the reproach. For this reason we will not let you go.” “Reverend Sir, the Supremely Enlightened sent you to my preceptor, and my preceptor sent me with you for this very reason. You remain here; I alone will go.” And bowing to the thirty monks, he said, “Reverend Sirs, if I have been guilty of any fault, pray forgive me.” So saying, he departed.*";
P_HTM[2401]="***The monks were profoundly moved, their eyes filled with tears, and their heart’s flesh trembled. The Chief Elder said to the thieves, “Lay disciples, this boy will be frightened if he sees you building a fire, sharpening stakes, and spreading leaves. Therefore, while you are making these preparations, let him remain at a distance.”*";
P_HTM[2402]="***The thieves took the novice with them, directed him to stand aside, and made all the preparations. When everything was in readiness, the ringleader of the thieves unsheathed his sword and approached the novice. The novice sat down, and sitting there, entered into a state of trance. The ringleader swung his sword and brought it down on the novice’s shoulder. But the sword bent double and edge struck edge. Thinking to himself, “I did not deliver the blow properly,” the thief straightened the sword and delivered another blow. This time the sword split from hilt to tip like a palm-leaf. (No one could have killed the novice at that time, even by piling Mount Sineru on top of him; much less with a sword.)*";
P_HTM[2403]="***When the ringleader of the thieves saw the miracle, he thought to himself, “Formerly my sword cut a stone pillar or an acacia stump as easily as the sprout of a plant. But just now it has once bent and once split like a palm-leaf. This sword, though it be insensible metal, knows the virtue of this youth; but I, who possess the gift of reason, know it not.” So saying, he flung his sword upon the ground, prostrated himself on his breast before the feet of the novice, and said, “Reverend Sir, we are in this forest for the sake of booty. Men, even when there are a thousand of them, seeing us afar off, tremble, and when there are only two or three of them, cannot utter a word. But you show not so much as a tremor, and your face is bright as gold in a crucible, or a kaṇikāra in full bloom. What is the reason?” And repeating the question, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2404]="***You tremble not, nor fear; nay more, your appearance is tranquil;*";
P_HTM[2405]="***Why weep you not at such a horror?*";
P_HTM[2406]="***The novice, rising from trance, preached the Law to the thief, saying, “Brother chief, he that has rid himself of the Depravities regards his existence as a burden set on his head, which, when it is destroyed, brings joy, not fear,” and uttered the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2407]="***Chief, he that is free from desire has no mental suffering;*";
P_HTM[2408]="***Seer, he that has rid himself of attachment has passed beyond all fear.*";
P_HTM[2409]="***If the Eye of Existence is destroyed as it should be in this life,*";
P_HTM[2410]="***Death is without terrors and is like the putting down of a burden.*";
P_HTM[2411]="***The ringleader of the thieves listened to the words of the novice, looked at the five hundred thieves, and said, “What do you intend to do?” “But you, master?” “So wonderful was the miracle I beheld just now that I have no more use for the life of a householder. I intend to become a monk under the novice.” “We will do the same thing too.” “Well said, friends.” Then the five hundred bowed to the novice and asked to be admitted to the Order. With the blades of their swords and arrows he cut off their hair and the skirts of their garments, and dyeing their garments in reddish-yellow earth, he caused them to put on yellow robes. Having so done, he established them in the Ten Precepts, and taking them with him, set out. He thought to himself, “If I go without seeing the Elders, they will not be able to perform their meditations; for doubtless, ever since I was captured by the thieves and went away with them, not one of them has been able to restrain his tears. With the thought in their minds, ‘Our novice has been killed,’ they will not be able to keep the Formula of Meditation before their minds. So I will see them before I go.”*";
P_HTM[2412]="***So with a retinue of five hundred monks he went to their place of residence. When they saw him, they were relieved in mind and said, “Good Saṁkicca, did they spare your life?” “Yes, Reverend Sirs. They sought to kill me, but were unable to do so, and believing in my virtues, they hearkened to the Law and retired from the world. I have come to see you before I depart. Perform your meditations with heedfulness. I am going to see the Teacher.” So saying, he bowed to those monks, and taking his own monks with him, went to his preceptor. “Saṁkicca, you have obtained pupils?” “Yes, Reverend Sir,” replied the novice and told him what had happened. The Elder said to him, “Saṁkicca, go see the Teacher.” “Very well,” said the novice. Bowing to the Elder, he took his monks with him and went to the Teacher.*";
P_HTM[2413]="***The Teacher said to him, “Saṁkicca, you have obtained pupils?” Saṁkicca told him what had happened. The Teacher asked the monks, “Monks, is his story true?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” Said the Teacher, “Monks, it were better for you to live but a single day, standing fast in virtue as you do now, than to live for a hundred years, confirmed in viciousness, committing acts of plunder.” And joining the connection, he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2414]="***110. Though one should live a hundred years, corrupt, not meditating,*";
P_HTM[2415]="***Yet were it better to live a single day in the practice of virtue, in meditation.*";
P_HTM[2416]="***After a time Saṁkicca made his full profession. When he had been a monk for ten years, he received his sister’s son as a novice, and the novice’s name was Atimuttaka. When the novice reached the proper age, the Elder sent him home, saying, “We are ready to profess you; go home to your parents and find out your exact age.” The novice set out for home to see his mother and father.*";
P_HTM[2417]="***On his way home he was captured by five hundred thieves, who threatened to kill him for the purpose of making an offering. But he converted them by preaching the Law to them, and they released him on condition that he should tell no one of their existence. Shortly afterwards he saw his mother and father coming along the road from the opposite direction, and although they were going straight towards the thieves, he kept his word to the thieves and did not tell them. His parents suffered rough treatment at the hands of the thieves. And they wept and said to him, “You also were in league with the thieves, no doubt, and for that reason refrained from telling us.” The thieves heard their reproaches and lamentations, and perceiving that the youth had kept his word and had refrained from telling his mother and father, believed in their hearts, and requested to be received into the Order. Like the novice Saṁkicca, he received them all into the Order and conducted them to his preceptor. His preceptor sent him to the Teacher, to whom he went and told what had happened. The Teacher asked the monks, “Monks, is his story true?” “Yes, Reverend Sir.” Then the Teacher joined the connection as before, and instructing them in the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2418]="***110. Though one should live a hundred years, corrupt, not meditating.*";
P_HTM[2419]="***Yet were it better to live a single day in the practice of virtue, in meditation.*";
P_HTM[2420]="*[90] 10. Khāṇukoṇḍaññattheravatthu**10. The Monk and the Thieves*";
P_HTM[2421]="***111. Though one should live a hundred years...*";
P_HTM[2422]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Khāṇu Koṇḍañña.*";
P_HTM[2423]="***This Elder, it appears, obtained a Formula of Meditation from the Teacher, and while residing in the forest attained Arahatship. Desiring to inform the Teacher of his attainment, he set out to return from the forest. Growing tired by the way, he left the road, seated himself on a flat stone, and entered into a state of trance. Now at that time a band of five hundred thieves plundered a village, packed up their spoils in sacks of sizes proportioned to the strength of their several members, placed the sacks on their heads, and carried them for a long distance. Becoming weary, they said to themselves, “We have come a long distance; let us rest on the top of this flat rock.” So saying, they left the road, went to the rock, and mistook the Elder for the stump of a tree. One of the thieves placed his sack on the Elder’s head, and another placed his sack near his body. One after another, the five hundred thieves set their sacks in a circle about him and then lay down and went to sleep.*";
P_HTM[2424]="***At dawn they woke up and took their sacks. Seeing the Elder, and thinking he was an evil spirit, they started to run away. The Elder said to them, “Lay disciples, have no fear; I am a monk.” Thereupon they prostrated themselves before his feet and begged his pardon, saying, “Pardon us, Reverend Sir; we mistook you for the stump of a tree.” The ringleader of the thieves said, “I intend to become a monk under the Elder.” The rest said, “We also will become monks.” And with one accord all of the thieves requested the Elder to make monks of them. The Elder made monks of them all, just as did the novice Saṁkicca. From that time forward he went by the name of Stump Koṇḍañña, Khāṇu Koṇḍañña.*";
P_HTM[2425]="***Accompanied by those monks, he went to the Teacher. When the Teacher asked him, “Koṇḍañña, you have obtained pupils?” he told him what had happened. The Teacher asked, “Monks, is this true?” “Yes, Reverend Sir; we never saw such an exhibition of magical power before and therefore we have become monks.” The Teacher replied, “Monks, it were better for you to live but a single day in the exercise of the wisdom you have just acquired than to live for a hundred years committing such acts of foolishness.” And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2426]="***111. Though one should live a hundred years, unwise, not meditating,*";
P_HTM[2427]="***Yet were it better to live a single day possessed of wisdom, in meditation.*";
P_HTM[2428]="*[91] 11. Sappadāsattheravatthu**11. On the Razor’s Edge*";
P_HTM[2429]="***112. Though one should live a hundred years, idle, listless,*";
P_HTM[2430]="***Yet were it better to live for a single day, and strive with might and main.*";
P_HTM[2431]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Sappadāsa.*";
P_HTM[2432]="***At Sāvatthi, we are told, the son of a respectable family, after hearing the Teacher preach the Law, was received into the Order and made his full profession. Becoming discontented after a time, he thought to himself, “The life of a layman is not suited to a youth of station like me; but even death would be preferable to remaining a monk.” So he went about considering ways of killing himself.*";
P_HTM[2433]="***Now one day, very early in the morning, the monks went to the monastery after breakfast, and seeing a snake in the hall where the fire was kept, put it into a jar, closed the jar, and carried it out of the monastery. The discontented monk, after eating his breakfast, drew near, and seeing the monks, asked them, “What’s that you’ve got, brethren?” “A snake, brother.” “What are you going to do with it?” “Throw it away.” The monk thought to himself, “I will commit suicide by letting the snake bite me.” So he said to the monks, “Let me take it; I’ll throw it away.”*";
P_HTM[2434]="***He took the jar from their hands, sat down in a certain place, and tried to make the snake bite him. But the snake refused to bite him. Then he put his hand into the jar, waved it this way and that, opened the snake’s mouth and stuck his finger in, but the snake still refused to bite him. So he said to himself, “It’s not a poisonous snake, but a house-snake,” threw it away, and returned to the monastery. The monks asked him, “Did you throw the snake away, brother?” “Brethren, that was not a poisonous snake; it was only a house-snake.” “Brother, that was a poisonous snake, all the same; it spread its hood wide, hissed at us, and gave us much trouble to catch. Why do you talk thus?” “Brethren, I tried to make it bite me, and even stuck my finger into its mouth, but I couldn’t make it bite.” When the monks heard this, they were silent.*";
P_HTM[2435]="***Now the discontented monk acted as barber of the monastery; and one day he went to the monastery with two or three razors, and laying one razor on the floor, cut the hair of the monks with the other. When he removed the razor from the floor, the thought occurred to him, “I will cut my throat with this razor and so put myself out of the way.” So he went to a certain tree, leaned his neck against a branch, and applied the blade of the razor to his windpipe. Remaining in this position, he reflected upon his conduct from the time of his full profession, and perceived that his conduct was flawless, even as the spotless disk of the moon or a cluster of transparent jewels. As he surveyed his conduct, a thrill of joy suffused his whole body. Suppressing the feeling of joy and developing Spiritual Insight, he attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties. Then he took his razor and entered the monastery inclosure.*";
P_HTM[2436]="***The monks asked him, “Where did you go, brother?” “Brethren, I went out thinking to myself, ‘I will cut my windpipe with this razor and so put myself out of the way.’ ” “How did you escape death?” “I can no longer carry a knife. For I said to myself, ‘With this razor will I sever my windpipe.’ But instead of so doing, I severed the Depravities with the Razor of Knowledge.” The monks said to themselves, “This monk speaks falsely, says what is untrue,” and reported the matter to the Exalted One. The Exalted One listened to their words and replied, “Monks, those that have rid themselves of the Depravities are incapable of taking their own life.” “Reverend Sir, you speak of this monk as one who has rid himself of the Depravities. But how comes it that this monk, possessed of the faculties requisite for the attainment of Arahatship, became discontented? How came he to possess those faculties? Why did not that snake bite him?” “Monks, the simple fact is that that snake was his slave in his third previous existence, and therefore did not dare to bite the body of his own master.” Thus briefly did the Teacher explain this cause to them. Thereafter that monk was known as Sappadāsa. (‘Having a snake as his slave.’)*";
P_HTM[2437]="***11a. Story of the Past: Discontented and covetous*";
P_HTM[2438]="***In the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, we are told, a certain youth of respectable family, having heard the Teacher preach the Law, was moved to enter the Order. Some time after he had made his full profession, discontent arose within him, and he spoke of it to a certain fellow-monk. The latter spoke to him repeatedly of the disadvantages connected with the life of a householder. The monk listened to his words, and became satisfied once more with the Religious Life.*";
P_HTM[2439]="***One day he was seated on the bank of a pool cleansing his monastic utensils of spots they had taken on in the days of his discontent, and his fellow-monk was seated beside him. Said he to his fellow-monk, “Brother, it was my intention on leaving the Order to give these utensils to you.” His fellow-monk thought, “What difference does it make to me whether this monk remains in the Order or leaves it? Now I shall get his utensils away from him.” From that time on, his fellow-monk would say to him, “How now, brother! What is the use of our living, we who go from house to house with potsherds in our hands seeking alms and are forbidden to talk and converse with son and wife?” This and much else did his fellow-monk say to him, dwelling on the advantages of the life of a householder. From listening to the talk of his fellow-monk, he became discontented again. Then the thought occurred to him, “At first, when I told this monk that I was discontented, he spoke of the disadvantages of the life of a householder; now, however, he dwells repeatedly on its advantages; I wonder what can be the reason.” The reason flashed through his mind, “It is because he covets these monastic utensils of mine.” End of Story of the Past.*";
P_HTM[2440]="***“Thus it was that because a certain monk became discontented in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, he became discontented in the present time; and because he meditated then for twenty thousand years, he obtained at the present time the faculties requisite for the attainment of Arahatship.” The monks, after hearing the Exalted One explain this matter, asked him a further question, “Reverend Sir, this monk says that he attained Arahatship even as he stood with the blade of his razor pressed against his windpipe. Is it possible to gain the Path of Arahatship in so short a period of time?” “Yes, monks, a monk who strives with all his might may gain the Path of Arahatship in raising his foot, in setting his foot on the ground, or even before his foot touches the ground. For it is better for a man who strives with all his might to live but a single instant than for an idle man to live a hundred years.” So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2441]="***112. Though one should live a hundred years, idle, listless,*";
P_HTM[2442]="***Yet were it better to live for a single day, and strive with might and main.*";

P_HTM[2447]="***And know that all the world contains doth rise and pass away.*";
P_HTM[2448]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher, while in residence at Jetavana, with reference to the nun Paṭācārā.*";
P_HTM[2449]="***Paṭācārā, we are told, was the daughter of a wealthy merchant of Sāvatthi. Her father was worth four hundred millions, and she was exceedingly beautiful. When she was about sixteen years old, her parents provided quarters for her in a palace seven stories high, and there they kept her, on the topmost floor, surrounded by guards. But in spite of these precautions she misconducted herself, and it was with her own page.*";
P_HTM[2450]="***Now it so happened that her father and mother had promised her in marriage to a certain young man who was her social equal, and finally they set the wedding-day. When the day was close at hand, she said to the page, “My parents tell me that they intend to give me in marriage to a young man who comes of such and such a family. Now you know very well that when I am once inside of my husband’s house, you may bring me presents and come to see me all you like, but you will never, never get in. Therefore, if you really love me, don’t delay an instant, but find some way or other of getting me out of this place.” “Very well, my love; this is what I will do: to-morrow, early in the morning, I will go to the city-gate and wait for you at such and such a spot; you manage, somehow or other, to get out of this place and meet me there.”*";
P_HTM[2451]="***On the following day he went to the appointed place and waited. Paṭācārā got up very early in the morning, put on soiled garments, disheveled her hair, and smeared her body with red powder. Then, in order to outwit her keepers, she took a water-pot in her hand, surrounded herself with slave-maidens, and set out as if she intended to fetch water. Escaping from the palace, she went to the appointed place and met her lover. Together they went a long way off, and took up their abode in a certain village. The husband tilled the soil, and gathered firewood and leaves in the forest. The wife fetched water in her water-pot, and with her own hand pounded the rice, did the cooking, and performed the other household duties. Thus did Paṭācārā reap the fruit of her own sin.*";
P_HTM[2452]="***By and by she became pregnant, and when the time for her delivery was near at hand, she made the following request to her husband, “Here I have no one to help me. But a mother and father always have a soft spot in their heart for their child. Therefore take me home to them, that I may give birth to my child in their house.” But her husband refused her request, saying to her, “My dear wife, what say you? If your mother and father were to see me, they would subject me to all manner of tortures. It is out of the question for me to go.” Over and over again she begged him, and each time he refused her.*";
P_HTM[2453]="***One day, when her husband was away in the forest, she went to the neighbors and said, “Should my husband ask you where I have gone when he returns, tell him that I have gone home to my parents.” And having so said, she closed the door of her house and went away. When her husband returned and observed that she was not there, he inquired of the neighbors, and they told him what had happened. “I must persuade her to return,” thought he, and set out after her. Finally he caught sight of her, and overtaking her, begged her to return with him. But try as he might, he was unable to persuade her to do so.*";
P_HTM[2454]="***When they reached a certain place, the birth-pains came upon her. Said she to her husband, “Husband, the birth-pains are come upon me.” So saying, she made her way into a clump of bushes, laid herself upon the ground, and there, with much tossing about and pain, she gave birth to a son. Then she said, “What I set out to go home for is over.” So back again to their house she went with him, and once more they lived together.*";
P_HTM[2455]="***After a time she became pregnant again. When the time for her delivery was at hand, she made the same request of her husband as before and received the same answer. So she took her child upon her hip and went away just as she had before. Her husband followed her, overtook her, and asked her to return with him. This she refused to do. Now as they went on their way, a fearful storm arose, out of due season. The sky was ablaze with flashes of lightning, and rent asunder, as it were, with thunder-claps, and there was an incessant downpour of rain. At that moment the birth-pains came upon her. She said to her husband, “Husband, the birth-pains are come upon me; I cannot stand it; find me a place out of the rain.”*";
P_HTM[2456]="***Her husband went hither and thither, axe in hand, seeking materials for a shelter. Seeing some brushwood growing on the top of an anthill, he set about to chop it down. Hardly had he begun his work, when a poisonous snake slipped out of the ant-hill and bit him. Instantly his body was burned up, as it were, by flames of fire shooting up within him, his flesh turned purple, and in the place wherein he stood, there he fell down dead.*";
P_HTM[2457]="***Paṭācārā, suffering intense pain, watched for her husband to return, but in vain. Finally she gave birth to a second son. The two children, unable to withstand the buffeting of the wind and the rain, screamed at the top of their lungs. The mother took them to her bosom, and crouching upon the ground with her hands and knees pressed together, remained in this posture all night long. Her whole body looked as though there were no blood left in it, and her flesh had the appearance of a sere and yellow leaf.*";
P_HTM[2458]="***When the dawn rose, she took her new-born son, his flesh as red as a piece of meat, and placed him on her hip. Then she gave the older boy one of her fingers to hold, and with the words, “Come, dear child, your father has left us,” set out along the same path her husband had taken. When she came to the ant-hill, there, on top of it, she saw her husband lying dead, his flesh purple, his body rigid. “All on account of me,” said she, “my husband has died upon the road,” and wailing and lamenting, she continued her journey.*";
P_HTM[2459]="***When she came to the river Aciravatī, she observed that by reason of the rain, which had lasted all night long, the river was swollen knee-deep, and in places waist-deep. She was too weak to wade across the stream with the two children; therefore she left the older boy on the near bank and carried the younger across to the far side. Breaking off a branch of a tree and spreading it out, she laid the child on it. Then, thinking to herself, “I must return to my other child,” she took leave of the younger boy and turned to recross the stream. But she could hardly bring herself to leave the little one, and again and again she turned around to look at him.*";
P_HTM[2460]="***She had barely reached midstream, when a hawk caught sight of the child, and mistaking him for a piece of meat, swooped down from the sky after him. The mother seeing the hawk swoop down after her child, raised both her hands and screamed with a loud voice, “Begone, begone! (Su, su!)” Three times she screamed, but the hawk was so far away that he failed to hear her, and seizing the boy, flew up into the air with him.*";
P_HTM[2461]="***When the older boy, who had been left on the near bank, saw his mother stop in the middle of the river and raise her hands, and heard her scream with a loud voice, he thought to himself, “She is calling me.” And in his haste he fell into the water. In this wise was her younger son carried off by a hawk, and her older son swept away by the river. And she wailed and lamented, saying, “One of my sons has been carried off by a hawk, the other swept away by the water; by the roadside my husband lies dead.” And thus wailing and lamenting, she went on her way.*";
P_HTM[2462]="***As she proceeded on her way, she met a certain man coming from Sāvatthi. She asked him, “Sir, where do you live?” “In Sāvatthi, my good woman.” “In the city of Sāvatthi, in such and such a street, lives such and such a family. Do you know them, sir?” “Yes, my good woman, I know them. But pray don’t ask me about that family. Ask me about any other family you know.” “Sir, I have no occasion to ask about any other. This is the only family I wish to ask about.” “Woman, you give me no opportunity to avoid telling you. Did you observe that it rained all last night?” “Indeed I did, sir. In fact, I am the only person the rain fell on all night long. How it came to rain on me, I will tell you by and by. But just tell me what has happened to the family of this wealthy merchant, and I will ask you no further questions.” “My good woman, last night the storm overturned that house, and it fell on the merchant and his wife and his son, and they perished, all three, and their neighbors and kinsmen are even now burning their bodies on one funeral pyre. Look there, my good woman! You can see the smoke now.”*";
P_HTM[2463]="***Instantly she went mad. Her clothing fell off from her body, but she knew not that she was naked. And naked as at her birth she wandered round and round, weeping and wailing and lamenting.*";
P_HTM[2464]="***Both my sons are dead; my husband on the road lies dead;*";
P_HTM[2465]="***My mother and father and brother burn on one funeral pyre.*";
P_HTM[2466]="***Those who saw her yelled, “Crazy fool! Crazy fool!” Some flung rubbish at her, others showered dust on her head, others pelted her with clods of earth.*";
P_HTM[2467]="***It so happened that at this time the Teacher was in residence at Jetavana monastery. As he sat there in the midst of his disciples preaching the Law, he saw Paṭācārā approach from afar, and recognized in her one who for a hundred thousand cycles of time had fulfilled the Perfections, one who had made her Earnest Wish and attained it.*";
P_HTM[2468]="***(We are told that in the dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara she had seen the Teacher Padumuttara take a certain nun by the arm and assign her preeminence among those that are versed in the Canon Law. It seemed as if the Teacher were opening the heaven of Indra and admitting the nun to the Garden of Delight. So she formed her resolve and made this prayer, “May I also obtain from a Buddha like you preeminence among nuns versed in the Canon Law.” The Buddha Padumuttara, extending his consciousness into the future and perceiving that her prayer would be fulfilled, made the following prophecy, “In the dispensation of a Buddha to be known as Gotama, this woman will bear the name Paṭācārā, and will obtain preeminence among nuns versed in the Canon Law.”)*";
P_HTM[2469]="***So when the Teacher beheld Paṭācārā approaching from afar, her prayer fulfilled, her Earnest Wish attained, he said, “There is none other that can be a refuge to this woman, but only I.” And he caused her to draw near to the monastery. The moment his disciples saw her, they cried out, “Suffer not that crazy woman to come hither.” But he said to them, “Depart from me; forbid her not.” And when she was come nigh, he said to her, “Sister, return to your right mind.” Instantly, through the supernatural power of the Buddha, she returned to her right mind. At the same moment she became aware that her clothing had fallen from off her body; and recovering at once her sense of modesty and fear of mortal sin, she crouched upon the ground.*";
P_HTM[2470]="***A certain man threw her his cloak. She put it on, and approaching the Teacher, prostrated herself before his golden feet with the Five Rests. Having so done, she said, “Venerable Sir, be thou my refuge, be thou my support. One of my sons has been carried off by a hawk, the other swept away by the water; by the roadside my husband lies dead; my father’s house has been wrecked by the wind, and in it have perished my mother and father and brother, and even now their bodies are burning on one funeral pyre.”*";
P_HTM[2471]="***The Teacher listened to what she had to say and replied, “Paṭācārā, be no more troubled. Thou art come to one that is able to be thy shelter, thy defense, thy refuge. What thou hast said is true. One of thy sons has been carried off by a hawk, the other swept away by the water; by the roadside thy husband lies dead; thy father’s house has been wrecked by the wind, and in it have perished thy mother and father and brother. But just as to-day, so also all through this round of existences, thou hast wept over the loss of sons and others dear to thee, shedding tears more abundant than the waters of the four oceans.” And he uttered the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2472]="***But little water do the oceans four contain,*";
P_HTM[2473]="***Compared with all the tears that man hath shed,*";
P_HTM[2474]="***By sorrow smitten and by suffering distraught.*";
P_HTM[2475]="***Woman, why heedless dost thou still remain?*";
P_HTM[2476]="***In this wise did the Teacher discourse on the round of existences without conceivable beginning. As he spoke, the grief which pervaded her body became less intense. Perceiving that her grief was become less intense, he continued his discourse as follows, “Paṭācārā, to one that is on his way to the world beyond, nor sons nor other kith and kin can ever be a shelter or a refuge. How much less can you expect them to be such to you in this present life! He that is wise should clarify his conduct, and so for himself make clear the path that leadeth to Nibbāna.” So saying, he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas,*";
P_HTM[2477]="***288. Nor sons nor father can a refuge be, nor kith and kin;*";
P_HTM[2478]="***In them, to him whom death assails, no refuge remains.*";
P_HTM[2479]="***289. Knowing this power of circumstances, the wise man, restrained by the moral precepts,*";
P_HTM[2480]="***Should straightway clear the path that leads to Nibbāna.*";
P_HTM[2481]="***At the conclusion of the discourse, Paṭācārā obtained the Fruit of Conversion, and the Depravities within her, as numerous as the particles of dust on the whole wide earth, were burned away. Many others likewise obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths. Paṭācārā, having obtained the Fruit of Conversion, requested the Teacher to admit her to the Order. The Teacher sent her to the community of nuns and directed that she be admitted. Afterwards she made her full profession and by reason of her happy demeanor (paṭitācārattā) came to be known as Paṭācārā.*";
P_HTM[2482]="***One day she filled her water-pot with water, and pouring out water, bathed her feet. As she poured out the water, she spilled some on the ground. The water ran a little way and disappeared. The second time it went a little farther. The third time a little farther yet. So she took this very incident for her Subject of Meditation, and fixing accurately in her mind the three occurrences, she meditated thus, “Even as the water I spilled the first time ran a little way and disappeared, so also living beings here in the world are dying in youth. Even as the water I spilled the second time ran a little farther, so also living beings here in the world are dying in the prime of life. Even as the water I spilled the third time ran a little farther yet, so also living beings here in the world are dying in old age.”*";
P_HTM[2483]="***The Teacher, seated in his Perfumed Chamber, sent forth an apparition of himself, and standing as it were face to face with her, spoke and said, “Paṭācārā, ‘twere better far to live but a single day, aye, but a single moment, and see the rise and set of the Five Elements of Being, than to live a hundred years and not see.” And joining the connection, he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2484]="***113. Though one should live a hundred years, ‘twere all in vain,*";
P_HTM[2485]="***Did one not see that all that is doth wax and wane;*";
P_HTM[2486]="***Instead, ‘twere better far to live a single day,*";
P_HTM[2487]="***And know that all the world contains doth rise and pass away.*";
P_HTM[2488]="***At the conclusion of the discourse Paṭācārā attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties.*";

P_HTM[2490]="***114. Though one should live a hundred years, the region of the deathless never seeing,*";
P_HTM[2491]="***’Twould be in vain; instead, ‘twould better be*";
P_HTM[2492]="***To live a single day, the region of the deathless seeing.*";
P_HTM[2493]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher at Jetavana, with reference to Kisā Gotamī.*";
P_HTM[2494]="***13 a. Kisā Gotamī marries the son of a rich merchant*";
P_HTM[2495]="***Once upon a time, the story goes, a merchant worth four hundred millions lived at Sāvatthi. Suddenly all of his wealth turned into charcoal. The merchant, overwhelmed with grief, refused to eat and took to his bed. One day a certain friend of his came to see him and asked him, “Sir, why are you so sorrowful?” The merchant told him what had happened. Said his friend, “Sir, give not yourself over to sorrow. I know a way out of the difficulty, if you will but make use of it.” “Well, sir, what am I to do?”*";
P_HTM[2496]="***Said his friend, “Spread matting in your shop, and pile the charcoal on it, and sit down as if you were selling it. People will come along and say to you, ‘Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses; but you are sitting here selling charcoal.’ Then you must say to them, ‘If I can’t sell what belongs to me, what am I to do?’ But again some one may say, ‘Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses; but you are sitting here selling yellow gold.’ Then you must say, ‘Where’s any yellow gold?’ Your customer will say, ‘There it is!’ Then say, ‘Let me have it.’ Your customer will bring you a handful of charcoal. Take it, cover it with your hands, and presto! it will turn into yellow gold. Now if your customer be a maiden, marry her to your son, turn over your four hundred millions to her, and live on what she gives you. But if your customer be a youth, marry your daughter to him as soon as she reaches marriageable age, turn over your four hundred millions to him, and live on what he gives you.”*";
P_HTM[2497]="***“A fine plan indeed!” said the merchant. So he piled the charcoal up in his shop, and sat down as if he were selling it. People came along and said to him, “Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses; but you are sitting here selling charcoal.” To such as asked this question, he replied as follows, “If I can’t sell what belongs to me, what am I to do?”*";
P_HTM[2498]="***There came one day to the door of his shop a certain maiden, the daughter of a poverty-stricken house. Her name was Gotamī, but by reason of the leanness of her body she was generally known as Kisā Gotamī. She came to buy something for herself; but when she saw the merchant, she said to him, “My good sir, most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses; but you are sitting here selling yellow gold.” “Maiden, where is there any yellow gold?” “Right there where you are sitting.” “Let me have some of it, maiden.” She took a handful of the charcoal and placed it in his hands. No sooner had it touched his hands than presto! it turned into yellow gold.*";
P_HTM[2499]="***Then said the merchant to her, “Which is your house, maiden?” Said she, “Such and such, sir.” The merchant, perceiving that she was unmarried, married her to his own son. He then gathered up his wealth (what was previously charcoal turning into yellow gold at his touch), and gave the four hundred millions into her charge. In time she became pregnant, and, after ten lunar months, gave birth to a son. But the child died as soon as he was able to walk.*";
P_HTM[2500]="***13 b. Kisā Gotamī seeks mustard seed to cure her dead child*";
P_HTM[2501]="***Now Kisā Gotamī had never seen death before. Therefore, when they came to remove the body for burning, she forbade them to do so. Said she to herself, “I will seek medicine for my son.” Placing the dead child on her hip, she went from house to house inquiring, “Know ye aught that will cure my son?” Everyone said to her, “Woman, thou art stark mad that thou goest from house to house seeking medicine for thy dead child.” But she went her way, thinking, “Surely I shall find someone that knoweth medicine for my child.”*";
P_HTM[2502]="***Now a certain wise man saw her and thought to himself, “This my daughter hath no doubt borne and lost her first and only child, nor death hath seen before; I must help her.” So he said to her, “Woman, as for me, I know not that wherewith to cure your child; but one there is that knoweth, and him I know.” “Sir, who is it that doth know?” “Woman, the Teacher doth know; go ask him.” “Good sir, I will go ask him.”*";
P_HTM[2503]="***So she went to the Teacher, paid obeisance to him, stood at his side, and asked him, “Venerable Sir, is it true, as men say, that thou dost know that wherewith to cure my child?” “Yea, that know I.” “What shall I get?” “A pinch of white mustard seed.” “That will I, Venerable Sir. But in whose house shall I get it?” “In whose house nor son nor daughter nor any other hath yet died.” “Very well, Venerable Sir,” said she, and paid obeisance to him. Then she placed the dead child on her hip, entered the village, stopped at the door of the very first house, and asked, “Have ye here any white mustard seed? They say it will cure my child.” “Yea.” “Well then, give it me.” They brought grains of white mustard seed and gave to her. She asked, “Friends, in the house wherein ye dwell hath son or daughter yet died?” “What sayest thou, woman? As for the living, they be few; only the dead be many.” “Well then, take back your mustard seed; that is no medicine for my child.” So saying, she gave back the mustard seed.*";
P_HTM[2504]="***After this manner, going from house to house, she plied her quest. Never a house wherein she found the mustard seed she sought; and when the evening came, she thought, “Ah! ’tis a heavy task I took upon myself. I thought ’twas I alone had lost a child, but in every village the dead are more in number than the living.” The while she thus reflected, hard became the heart the which erewhile was soft with mother’s love. She took the child and in a forest laid him down, and going to the Teacher paid obeisance to him and beside him took her stand.*";
P_HTM[2505]="***Said the Teacher, “Didst thou get the single pinch of mustard seed?” “Nay, that did I not. Venerable Sir. In every village the dead are more in number than the living.” Said the Teacher, “Vainly didst thou imagine that thou alone hadst lost a child. But all living beings are subject to an unchanging law, and it is this: The Prince of Death, like to a raging torrent, sweeps away into the sea of ruin all living beings; still are their longings unfulfilled.” And instructing her in the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2506]="***287. Whoso hath set his heart on sons or flocks and herds,*";
P_HTM[2507]="***To worldly pleasures given o’er whose thoughts, –*";
P_HTM[2508]="***Even as a torrent sweeps away a sleeping town,*";
P_HTM[2509]="***So him the Prince of Death doth take and bear away.*";
P_HTM[2510]="***As the Teacher uttered the last word of the Stanza, Kisā Gotamī was established in the Fruit of Conversion. Likewise did many others also obtain the Fruit of Conversion, and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths. Kisā Gotamī requested the Teacher to admit her to the Order; accordingly he sent her to the community of nuns and directed that she be admitted. Afterwards she made her full profession and came to be known as the nun Kisā Gotamī.*";
P_HTM[2511]="***One day it was her turn to light the lamp in the Hall of Confession. Having lighted the lamp, she sat down and watched the tongues of flame. Some flared up and others flickered out. She took this for her Subject of Meditation and meditated as follows, “Even as it is with these flames, so also is it with living beings here in the world: some flare up, while others flicker out; they only that have reached Nibbāna are no more seen.”*";
P_HTM[2512]="***The Teacher, seated in his Perfumed Chamber, sent forth an apparition of himself, and standing as it were face to face with her, spoke and said, “Even as it is with these flames, so also is it with living beings here in the world: some flare up, while others flicker out; they only that have reached Nibbāna are no more seen. Therefore, better is the life of him that seeth Nibbāna, though he live but for an instant, than the lives of them that endure for a hundred years and yet see not Nibbāna.” And joining the connection, he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2513]="***114. Though one should live a hundred years, the region of the deathless never seeing,*";
P_HTM[2514]="***’Twould be in vain; instead, ‘twould better be*";
P_HTM[2515]="***To live a single day, the region of the deathless seeing.*";
P_HTM[2516]="***At the conclusion of the discourse Kisā Gotamī, even as she sat there, attained Arahatship and the Supernatural Faculties.*";

P_HTM[2518]="***Though one should live a hundred years...*";
P_HTM[2519]="***This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Bahuputtikā.*";
P_HTM[2520]="***In a certain household at Sāvatthi, we are told, were seven sons and seven daughters. All of them married as soon as they were old enough, and were happy, as was indeed their nature. After a time their father died. But the mother, the eminent female lay disciple, even after the death of her husband, did not for some time relinquish control of his property. One day her sons said to her, “Mother, now that our father is dead, what is the use of your retaining his property? Can we not support you?” She listened to their words, but said nothing. After they had spoken to her several times about the matter, she thought to herself, “My sons will look after me; why need I keep the property separate for myself?” So she divided the estate into two parts and distributed them among the children.*";
P_HTM[2521]="***After a few days had passed, the wife of her oldest son said to her, “Apparently this is the only house our excellent mother visits; she acts as though she had given both parts of her estate to her oldest son.” In like manner did the wives of her other sons address her. So likewise did her daughters address her whenever she entered their houses, from the oldest to the youngest. With such disrespect was she treated that finally she said to herself, “Why should I live with them any longer? I will enter the Order and live the life of a nun.” So she went to the nuns’ convent and asked to be admitted to the Order. They received her into the Order, and when she had made her full profession she went by the name of Bahuputtikā the nun.*";
P_HTM[2522]="***“Since I have entered the Order in old age,” thought she, as she performed the major and minor duties assigned to nuns, “it behooves me to be heedful; I will therefore spend the whole night in meditation.” On the lower terrace, putting her hand on a pillar, she guided her steps thereby and meditated. Even as she walked along, fearful that in the dark places she might strike her head against a tree or against some other object, she put her hand on a tree and guided her steps thereby, and meditated. Resolved to observe only the Law taught by the Teacher, she considered the Law and pondered the Law and meditated.*";
P_HTM[2523]="***The Teacher, seated in the Perfumed Chamber, sent forth a radiant image of himself, and sitting as it were face to face with her, talked with her, saying, “Bahuputtikā, though one should live a hundred years, did he not behold the Law I have taught and meditate thereon, it were better that he live but a moment and behold the Law I have taught.” And joining the connection and teaching the Law, he pronounced the following Stanza,*";
P_HTM[2524]="***115. Though one should live a hundred years, did he not behold the Law Supreme,*";
P_HTM[2525]="***It were better that he live but a single day and behold the Law Supreme.*";
P_HTM[2526]="***At the conclusion of the Stanza, Bahuputtikā became an Arahat, possessed of the Supernatural Faculties.*";
