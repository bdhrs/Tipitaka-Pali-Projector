Setup of browser or webserver:

You will need Firefox web browser.  This will in turn need the <b>security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</b> set to <b>false</b>.  You can do so by typing about:config in the address bar and then searching for this property and set it to false.  

A few other methods.  
Chrome has an extension called web server which should work

Python also has a web browser as well.
If you have Python installed, then you can simply open a terminal in the downloaded root project directory and type the following command:  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then you can go to the web address http://localhost:8080
