# Tipitaka-Pali-Projector TPP.

You can download this program in the clone or download zip section of this github.
Soon there will be a release section.
Then open up index.htm and start.

Setup of browser or webserver:

You will need Firefox web browser.  This will in turn need the file.uri.strict set to false.  You can do so by typing about:config in the address bar and then searching for this property and set it to false.  

A few other methods.  
Chrome has an extension called web server which should work

Python also has a web browser as well.
If you have Python installed, then you can simply open a terminal in the downloaded root project directory and type the following command:  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then you can go to the web address http://localhost:8080


There are some videos in the tutorial directory.  It is important that you follow the security instructions.
