# Tipitaka-Pali-Projector TPP  more information coming.
There are some videos in the tutorial directory.  It is important that you follow the security instructions.
This video explains how to use the TPP

This is work in progress and not ready for release.  It needs new code arch and better gui but, most of the features are implemented.  Just a few more to go.

To invoke the TPP algo2 you need to press on the "go" button.

Within a week a  flat file of broken up words will be added .  It is generated by DPR and then will be edited by hand because the algo can only do so much.. about 90% and if it fails, our algo2 can do a different 90% .

watch this video to understand all of the features.. consider this a proposal rather than a fully functioning app.
